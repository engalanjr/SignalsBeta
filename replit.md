# SignalsAI v8.0 - Customer Success Management

## Overview
SignalsAI is a customer success management application that helps track and manage customer signals, relationships, and action plans. This is a frontend-only web application built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Project Structure
- `index.html` - Main application entry point
- `app.css` - Application styles with Domo brand colors
- `js/` - JavaScript modules and services
  - `SignalsAI.js` - Main application class
  - `DataService.js` - Data loading and management
  - `services/` - Various service modules for different features
- `server.py` - Python HTTP server for serving static files
- `manifest.json` - Web app manifest for PWA functionality

## Technology Stack
- Frontend: Vanilla HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+)
- Server: Python 3.11 HTTP server
- External Dependencies: Font Awesome, Domo.js utility library

## Development Setup
The application runs on port 5000 using a Python HTTP server that:
- Serves static files with proper cache headers
- Includes CORS support for cross-origin requests
- Binds to 0.0.0.0 for Replit environment compatibility

## Key Features
- Signal Feed management with filtering and categorization
- Portfolio overview with account summaries
- Action Plans tracking and management
- Customer relationship insights
- Interactive comments and feedback system

## Configuration
- Frontend serves on port 5000 (required for Replit)
- Server configured with no-cache headers to prevent caching issues
- Application gracefully falls back to sample data when Domo APIs are unavailable

## Recent Changes
- **Updated master data source to new PDP dataset**: "View of SignalsAI _ CORE _ WIP _ PDP_1757418159244.csv" containing 295 comprehensive signal records with expanded field set
- **Enhanced signals data model**: Added new fields including signal_id, call_id, call_date, and extended play metadata (play types, roles, documentation locations)
- **Improved CSV parsing**: Updated DataService.js to handle all new columns from the PDP dataset including AI context fields and enhanced play information
- Implemented priority-based signal sorting (High > Medium > Low, then by call_date DESC for chronological accuracy)
- Added pagination system for portfolio view showing 3 signals at a time with "+X more" functionality
- Fixed Map.get() error and renderCurrentTab() function reference issues
- Fixed scroll jump issue: "+X more" pagination now expands in place without page movement
- Updated financial metrics box: replaced "ARR" with "Renewal Baseline$", consolidated GPA and % Pacing into blue box, changed to "Next Renewal Date"
- Removed second row of metrics (MAU, TENURE) for cleaner, consolidated layout
- Fixed field mapping for bks_renewal_baseline_usd and % Pacing to display real data from CSV
- Updated % Pacing to multiply by 100 and show one decimal place (e.g., 85.0%)
- Changed "Financial Overview" label to "Account Overview"
- Simplified signal detail experience: removed Recommended Actions, Event Source, Comments sections and Acknowledge/Create Plan buttons
- Like and Not Accurate buttons now properly connected to existing interaction CRUD methods
- Added toggle functionality: clicking "Liked!" or "Marked Inaccurate" will remove that feedback and return to default state
- Updated pagination system: replaced "+X more" with "Show 3 more" and "Show Less" buttons positioned at bottom of signals section
- Made AI Recommendations priority badge data-driven: shows "IMMEDIATE" for accounts with high priority signals, "NEAR-TERM" for others
- Added dates to AI Recommendations: each recommended action now displays its creation date from the CSV data using the created_date field
- **Removed "Add to Plan" modal system**: Completely cleaned up the previous modal implementation to prepare for fresh redesign - removed all HTML, CSS, JavaScript functions, and event handlers related to the centered modal approach
- **Redesigned Action Plans interface**: Transformed from card-based to modern project management table layout inspired by Asana/Monday.com with columns for checkbox, task, due date, # plays, priority, and assignee
- **Implemented account grouping**: Action plans organized by customer account with collapsible sections and task counts
- **Added JSON fallback system**: Action Plans now load real data from `action-plans-fallback.json` when Domo endpoints fail, preserving actual account names, tasks, and Customer Success plays
- **Enhanced data processing**: Real action plan data is transformed and grouped by account, with proper assignee mapping and CS plays count extraction
- **Implemented action-level plan creation drawer**: Added "Add to Plan" buttons to individual AI recommendations with sliding drawer modal
- **Created comprehensive drawer workflow**: Features blue box display of recommended action, "Toolbox of Plays" with 0-3 play checkboxes based on action_id, and "Plan Details" text area for user notes
- **Connected drawer to Action Plan CRUD**: Form submission properly creates action plans with selected plays and user comments using existing service methods
- **Enhanced UI/UX**: Professional right-sliding drawer with backdrop, responsive design, and proper styling matching application theme
- **Fixed Action Plans plays count display**: Corrected plays count calculation to properly read from action plan plays arrays, ensuring accurate display of CS plays for each action item
- **Implemented plays management drawer modal**: Created full plays drawer interface that opens when clicking the plays button in Action Plans view, showing all associated CS plays with completion tracking
- **Added play completion functionality**: Users can now mark individual CS plays as "complete" or "pending" with visual feedback including checkboxes, status badges, and strike-through text for completed plays
- **Enhanced play status persistence**: Play completion status is saved to action plan data and persists across sessions, with real-time updates to the Action Plans view
- **Added success/error notifications**: Implemented toast-style notifications for play update operations with proper styling and auto-dismiss functionality
- **Implemented comprehensive task details modal**: Fixed task modal content to show actual action names instead of "No Title", renamed "Associated CS Plays" to "Sub Tasks", and resolved data structure issues for proper display
- **Connected task details Save Changes to CRUD methods**: Task property updates (due date, priority, assignee, status) now use ActionPlanService.updateActionPlan() for proper data persistence, with complete error handling and UI refresh functionality
- **Replaced "# Plays" column with "Task Status"**: Action Plans table now displays task status badges instead of plays count, sourcing data from live action plan objects using CRUD methods
- **Implemented task sorting by priority and due date**: Tasks within each account are now sorted by Priority (High > Medium > Low) then Due Date (ascending), providing logical task organization
- **Added comprehensive status badge styling**: Professional color-coded status badges for Pending, In Progress, Complete, Cancelled, and On Hold states
- **Fixed critical action plan data integrity issue**: Resolved missing account associations that prevented proper account grouping by creating Python script to map 8,544 signal-to-account relationships from CSV data, fixing 10 of 16 broken action plans
- **Enhanced ActionPlanService with 4-method account resolution system**: Added robust account ID resolution using selectedSignal lookup, signal-to-account mapping, drawer title parsing, and account name matching for graceful fallbacks
- **Implemented comprehensive data validation system**: Added automatic validation during action plan creation and loading with auto-fix capabilities, pre-save validation, and clear error messaging to prevent future association issues
- **Added professional task deletion with multi-select functionality**: Implemented Ctrl/Cmd + click multi-selection, right-click context menu for single and bulk deletion, professional confirmation modal with task count display, and full integration with ActionPlanService CRUD operations
- **Resolved production deployment errors**: Fixed fallback JSON loading, assignee type validation, and portfolio error messaging for clean deployment to Domo production environment
- **Fixed multiple action plans display issue**: Corrected storage logic that was overwriting plans with same account ID - now uses unique plan IDs as storage keys, allowing multiple tasks per account to display correctly
- **Fixed user ID resolution consistency**: Resolved issue where Action Plans table showed raw user IDs (621623466) while task details drawer showed proper names - implemented comprehensive user ID mapping system that converts numeric IDs to proper names (e.g., 621623466 â†’ "Ed Engalan") with consistent initials generation ("EE") across both Action Plans table and task details drawer
- **Simplified data source consistency**: Streamlined task details drawer to use same data source (`getFormattedActionPlans()`) as Action Plans table, eliminating complex dual-lookup system and ensuring perfect data consistency between grid and drawer views
- **Fixed task details drawer opening issue**: Resolved "Could not find task data" error by correcting the data structure mismatch between grid display and drawer lookup - drawer now properly accesses plan data structure from formatted action plans
- **Fixed CS Plays display issue**: Resolved problem where CS Plays section showed "Play 1" instead of actual play names - updated rendering logic to handle plays stored as strings (most common format) rather than objects, now correctly displays full play names like "Advanced Roadmaps - Drive growth with detailed, strategic roadmaps aligned to your unique business goals."
- **Fixed auto-save functionality in task details drawer**: Resolved issue where changing task properties (status, priority, due date, assignee) wasn't persisting to app database - fixed local state synchronization between DataService.actionPlans array and app.actionPlans Map, enhanced data structure compatibility for proper field updates, and added comprehensive debugging for save operations
- **Fixed signal feedback button visual states**: Resolved issue where "Like" and "Not Accurate" buttons weren't showing visual feedback after being clicked - buttons now immediately update to show "Liked!" or "Not Accurate" state with proper icons and styling by re-rendering the current tab after feedback is successfully saved
- Configured deployment settings for autoscale target

## Deployment
Configured for autoscale deployment using the Python server to serve static files.
