How are you? You're right? Dale hasn't responded to this. I just texted him again to see if this still worked. It's been busy here it is.
Jonathan T: Yeah, yeah, we've just, you know, between, this and managing, you know, the other core tools and stuff. Hey, Dale just, but, yeah, I've been pretty busy.
Michael N: Awesome.
Jonathan T: But, keeps,
Dale W: adding shit to my calendar,
Jonathan T: Dale never gets to engineering. Oh,
Michael N: I know you got spare time on your hands.
Dale W: I had to cut my meeting with Doug off early to come here, so.
Michael N: Oh, that's good. So, you're welcome.
Dale W: I just haven't even had time to respond to your texts though, so.
Michael N: Well, I just wanted to, John had asked if, texted and said, you know, can we get on a call with Dale? He wants to make sure it's going in the right direction. And, and this is what you're looking for. So, I'm going to turn it over to John?
Jonathan T: Yeah. So, what I did, let me get a window here that doesn't have a 1,000,000 vectors… you know, I, okay. So, I've been testing this and I wrote a bunch of tests and… I just want to show you kind of what this does so that we can see, just make sure we're all going in the right direction. So, there's instructions on how to install it and everything. But it lives in that repo, and it's we're calling it, I'm, calling it domovector and it has, you know, it has a bunch of different commands in it that you can use. We can delete, we can upload. We can, you know, group, we can delete by group, we can get. So, so it has some, pretty, some of the pretty basic crud commands for, vectors and then also for file sets. So, I'm just wondering, is this what you need? And if maybe you need to see it work in order, to decide? But, for instance, we can go domovectorconfigure and it'll ask us to give it an API key because it's going to be operating as a user in your instance. So create a user that, you know, has appropriate permissions and then create an API key under that user. You know what I mean? In the token, and then you give it to this, and this can operate as that user. So it'll ask for your token. It'll ask for your, let me see if I can find one of these that's not full of private information here. Yeah. There we go.
Dale W: So, can we back up for just a second here? Because my mind is taking a minute to switch gears, so.
Jonathan T: This,
Dale W: cli is helping us do which piece of this again?
Jonathan T: This is for you to vectorize, embed your, and embed your images. So, so like, the trouble I thought you guys were having was, how do we get all these images embedded, right? And, and how do we, how do we get them into the vectors for them to be read by the application?
Dale W: And we're talking about which app?
Jonathan T: Mlr?
Dale W: Okay. The mlr app, not, the thing that the grant reveals tomorrow.
Michael N: That's right? That's GV that's the global vision one.
Dale W: All right. Okay. Sorry, this is the point where I have way too many. I.
Jonathan T: Don't know what that's going on. I don't know what that's like.
Dale W: All right. So, this is a utility… and the command, and then the command line you've got it, but then the code would allow us to figure out how to make an API call to do the same thing if we needed to.
Jonathan T: Yeah. And I mean, it's all written in. It's, all written in python. But yeah, the code is, the code is out there. I've made it public. So, so you're welcome to go look at it. And I mean, it's nothing terribly complex but, the image portion might help you do this. I mean, it just converts things to basics. Basically, it basically scans through an in, through a folder and then just converts them to base 64 and then creates the embeddings in the vector that you've set. So, yeah, I mean, you can follow this code if that's how you guys want to do it and take it out of here or there's, this tool, this cli that allows you to just interact with it. So,
Dale W: Well, and I guess, you know, for depending on what tomorrow's call yields and how all of that works. And I think coming into this like we're learning more now about where these different components and modules and things will show up. So, I think, you know, I, this may be useful, just like to plug and go. This may, you know, we would want to take a look at it. So, I'm just trying to figure out exactly what you've what we've got here and how we could leverage it,
Jonathan T: Okay. Yeah. I mean, if that's fine with me, what is it include images? So, so I mean, you can see, I've got this folder full of images and it's just going to go through each one, base 64 encode it and then upload it, embed it into the, to the index that I've specified here, but.
Dale W: And then that index is what is subscribed to in the app like, the that was embedded either through codeengine or I don't remember if it was codeengine or in the app itself, but that's where you used to find it all.
Jonathan T: It's in codeengine. And so like you can see, we've got, we've we can fetch all these. You've got the embeddings that I just push up pushed up there. So yeah, I mean, it does just some of the basic things for interacting with vector. But I mean, if you guys need help writing code that's fine. You do have an example of this embedding… in the codeengine. I took that and I translated it to python here and I've written a cli around it since I was already building a cli for another project?
Dale W: That's fine. I'm not saying it's, invalid. I'm just trying to again rationalize like in my brain and probably, you know, thinking out loud a little bit cause I'm, not getting a lot of sleep this week, short weeks just make you cram more work into shorter periods of time, right?
Jonathan T: Yeah, I got it. Dude. Yeah, it's just, I'm hoping this is helpful to you. I built it for another purpose, but it seemed like modifying it a little bit for your needs and then just making sure it was well tested, and stuff, would help, you guys out. So.
Dale W: Yep. I think it will, I think there's definitely going to be a way for us to, you know, load some more stuff in there, make it easier i",Consumption Pricing Model,549500.3,Enterprise,IPGHEALTH.COM,4,Media,24,$5M to <$10M,Upsell,Blank,Closed Won,Michael Napoli,2025-08-22,2025-08-20,2025-08-26,2025-08-26,2025-08-26,2025-08-26,2025-08-26,,0015w00002a1T9QAAU

Hi.
Aishwarya D: Hello?
BrianWilliam 9: Hi, can you hear me? Hello?
Aishwarya D: Yes, I can hear.
BrianWilliam 9: You?
Aishwarya D: Hi.
BrianWilliam 9: Hey.
Aishwarya D: Hey, I can still see the code in your name.
BrianWilliam 9: Yeah. It's been too much time trying to change it.
Aishwarya D: Oh, no worries. Hey, Christine.
BrianWilliam 9: Hey, Christine. Eric and Vu won't, be able to join us for today, but I don't know if we're waiting on anyone else. Maybe we can get started.
Aishwarya D: Sure. Vu had shared his findings and we had the time to work on all of them. So I just have one question and I can quickly share my screen. I might have to close few tabs. Just give me a second. So, do we want to start with Vu's, mail and the changes we made?
BrianWilliam 9: Yeah, yeah. Let's go through those first.
Aishwarya D: All right. So, he mentioned about the budget not tying up. Let me go, yeah, the gross profit in budget. So now… give me a second. Yeah. So let me add cost of revenue in the card?
BrianWilliam 9: Okay.
Aishwarya D: The percent revenue columns as well. I know they were percent of revenues, revenue should always be 100 and the other should be breakdown with the revenue. So that is fixed. We had to make calculation changes. So that's also resonating, correctly? So, now, if you'll see… it's tying out whatever values you're seeing here, the calculation is working for gross profit.
BrianWilliam 9: Okay.
Aishwarya D: And the breakdowns are now based on revenue.
BrianWilliam 9: Awesome.
Aishwarya D: So that's done as well? What was… the next one? Yeah. I think that those were his findings. So there were just multiple columns. So the percent revenues that's what he was mentioning. So that's all taken care of. And the last point was asking if we need ttm calculations in the consolidated view. So we built this view off of the PPT and PPT did not have the ttm calculations, which is at mtd and ytd. So, would you want that to be added? Because I think Vue's, dashboard has the ttm calculation, I think.
BrianWilliam 9: Yeah. Can we add the ttm please?
Aishwarya D: Yeah, yes, we can. Yes. So, the ttm columns, okay? We can add them.
BrianWilliam 9: And then I got one other request on the first card that we were looking at. Yeah. So I know we have like year over year percentages… there, so that one point seven percent, like as an example that's green. Is there a way that we can add a column for the prior year amounts as well?
Aishwarya D: Yes. Yeah, we can add the prior year amounts?
BrianWilliam 9: Okay.
Aishwarya D: Would you want it to be placed? Do you have any preference?
BrianWilliam 9: Yeah, if we go all the way to the left. So typically, what we show is, let me just pull up an example here. I don't think the order matters that much, but like the current month. So for, if you're still sharing, but like, the month to date amounts for both actuals, budget and prior year, I think that order is fine. Like right after budget here, whatever the prior year amounts are.
Aishwarya D: Okay. All right. Yeah, we can. So a prior month to date, and this would be prior year.
BrianWilliam 9: Yep, year to date and ttm as well. I think it'd just be easier to look at like, the year over year percentage calcs. So you can understand like what the base is like. I know we see here, you know, 11 point nine, but like, what's the actual amount, so.
Aishwarya D: Correct. Yes, I can add that. This one thing I noticed, I know, we were filtering on the, in one of the calls we had, we were asked not to include Elliot's Ng, mechanical services, yep in on the cards. But if I remove them, then the numbers are very close to what we see on the PPT. So not sure if we are removing it from, do… we have that filter added to excel?
BrianWilliam 9: Yeah, it's a complicating point for that Ge, entity. I think something recently changed here that they're using this eliminations book in sage or in tac. Now, previously, like if you didn't exclude those entities, it would double up the revenue and cost of revenue. So here, so is this, I guess this is still pulling from excel, right?
Aishwarya D: Yes, this is pulling from it.
BrianWilliam 9: And I don't know eventually we want to switch it to just intacct. Because then if we do switch intacct, then the filter that you have for the excel data version would have to be taken out, let's leave it in for now. Like as is, okay. Let's note for the future when we switch over to intacct, like you got to exclude those filters now.
Aishwarya D: All right. So, apart from the previous year amount columns, I think we have this card looking a lot better than what it was yesterday. Is that right to say?
BrianWilliam 9: Yeah, I see the percentage of revenue. I guess maybe the cost of revenue percentages as a total will show up.
Aishwarya D: Sorry, I need to remove cost of revenue.
BrianWilliam 9: Oh, yeah. You can take that out. That's fine. Okay. Okay. I'm just checking something really quick. It's still from excel. It's showing in our company. So, we have vertical op hex. Sorry, how's the operating profit with Astra vertical and adjustments working. It looks like the difference is like our small amount of intercompany revenue. Is there like a separate calculation for that line?
Aishwarya D: Yes. So just show that to you. And… we have added that to the ETL. So, this is what we are using to calculate Astra, vertical op hex.
BrianWilliam 9: Okay, great.
Aishwarya D: Yes. And then we have this formula… which is, I mean, it's essentially subtracting because it's a negative. So that's why it's Irish in here. Does that make sense? Because the polarity of the vertical op hex?
BrianWilliam 9: Is that because somewhere in the ETL, the polarity of the vertical op hex is showing as a negative number.
Aishwarya D: That's right?
BrianWilliam 9: Okay. And that's different from like the op co polarity. I mean, I guess it would have to be if you have to like change… the sign especially in particular for the vertical op hex?
Aishwarya D: I think it is already set somewhere here, I think, but I'm not aware. So, let… me see. Yeah.

Sorry, I'm just a couple minutes late. I was finishing up another call.
Jason J: Dude. You're fine. Don't worry about it, man. I'm good… man. I got cloudamp turned on, man. What do you think I've been doing for the last two days? Yeah. Okay. So, yeah, I just finished that. Okay. So let me share to start and I'll show you at least what I have started for the ML part. But then there's other stuff to help with too. Okay. So this is not it. This is one of the millions of other things I've been working on… because like I said, like the beginning of this week, almost everything crashed like stuff wasn't running and doing stuff correctly on timing and that, and I ended up having to fix all of that along with being sick. So that was fun… ML. It would be this one. Okay? So what I've done here is I pulled together all of our orders if… it shows once it shows, it'll make more sense there. We go back… to the, it looks like. Does it have to be 16 there? Well, okay. It might have older than there too. Okay? Wonderful. Stop messing with me. Okay. Basically this is just all the stuff like the fiscal year. I mean, just all different ways to look at like here's your fiscal week. We report in weeks a lot. So that's nice to have there here's. When it was shipped, which warehouse it comes from, which, that will be important, the order. And you see these are mightily duplicated because as we get further, it's going to get into the individual items status when it was ordered, the company it went to, which that'll be important later on to pull company information in like how good of partners are they? Once we figure out some of those metrics of how to do that. And… now we're getting into the manifest information itself, which is… like what the items are put onto. So they buy the SB manifest and it's got 600 a 1,000 items on it or whatever. So manifest id is just my internal number. SB number is what they go by in the buildings. BL is what it's shipped under. It's a bill of lading when it shipped here's. How many containers were on it here's? How many items? So there were 559 items on 12 pallets on this one. Okay. Now here's the starts coming to the stuff here's. The full manifest cost… which is, our cost like our, like what we actually paid for it. Then there is a wholesale rate which is the markup. So basically we take this and marked it up 15 percent and we have a wholesale cost which is what we show to the vendors.
Benjamin P: Okay.
Jason J: Okay. And then one of the big projects I had changes, it used to be 15 across the board. It's now dynamic, that was dynamic pricing. V1, is that… newer ones? You're gonna see many different wholesale rates because each category will have different ones, but these numbers will still all be right. And then just the category type, what group it's in, what the vendor rate is, which is, this is how much the vendor is going to pay for this group, HD… com and category mixture. So the vendor pays 13 percent of the wholesale rate… and that equals the SB amount, which is this is what the vendor actually paid for the entire SB, all 559 items. Okay? Let me all.
Benjamin P: Right. So we're.
Jason J: we're getting down into because you can see these are still all duplicated. We're getting down into the individual items.
Benjamin P: They're coming, but that's 2000 and help me understand because our cost was like 18,000.
Jason J: Right. Yeah, it was 19… and then 22,000, they pay 13 percent of that. They buy our, that product. This is salvage, remember? So.
Benjamin P: That's.
Jason J: that's, where that comes in. We're getting a recovery of that. So, so they pay, I mean, this is why it's lucrative for them to be doing it.
Benjamin P: Yeah. So it's extremely discounted like 13 percent of what they would have been paying.
Jason J: But you can be getting some of this can be trash too. You never know.
Benjamin P: Yeah. So in other words, you're getting 13 percent of the wholesale amount in return versus zero because it's salvage. Yeah.
Jason J: Basically, instead of just throwing it away, and then when you look at it that way, you've got to add on what cost of disposal is too. Yeah, this is a good way to do it. So, this is the SB amount. This is all invoice information. Like if they pay what the total payment was on the invoice, I mean, this just was all in here. Here. This one's gonna be important. It's MP almost all the way down to begin with. That means marketplace, that means it was sold on our, you're going to Amazon and buying it type platform. There will be bid and buy also, which those two mean you're doing it on the eBay type platform. So you're it's the actual auction and the… vendor rate will not be the actual rate that they have in their rate files. It'll be the rate that they paid or that they bid… because they bid by rates they bid. Hey, I'll pay 20 percent for this one, 30 percent whatever. So… and from there. And, this was the, this, these two, this won't really matter but this is the dynamic pricing V1 tracking. So basically as you get further down, it's gonna say the original amount at 15 percent would have been this, but because we sold it at 30 percent, it's this, okay. And that's that number that I'm using for that 10,000,000 gain that we've done since we put that in. But I don't know that, that's gonna matter for this. So now we are down at the item level. Okay? You can see the, this is the rlc's individual id for it, that can probably be duplicated across rlcs… item ids will. But because you can see here, this is the actual what the item was. You'll… see the department class subclass, I ids. At least, I don't, the place where we have these mapped from in the HDR system doesn't link them all for some reason. I don't know why. I will probably find another source and try and bring them all in. Well, I will, I should say then the item model number, who the vendor id was, who the vendor is. And I did check this out earlier to make sure. Okay, this is the scan quantity. All of these numbers here are based on one item. Okay? So get to add up the total price.

Benjamin P: Want to send over some screenshots of what you're seeing in the GA for interface so that we can sort of use that as a benchmark when we're building them out.
Bellamy Y: I think I'll do that. Yeah. So… let me just try to find out active users by operating system. I'll do that while we're on the call right now because my day has been not kind to me today.
Benjamin P: Yeah, that would be super helpful and you already have the account set up too, right?
Bellamy Y: Yeah, I think I do.
Benjamin P: Have you shared that with me already?
Bellamy Y: How do I share that?
Benjamin P: This is still the demo?
Bellamy Y: And.
Benjamin P: then, yeah, like so that and then go to accounts at the bottom left? Yeah, there's a little key where you're at.
Bellamy Y: And.
Benjamin P: then, yeah, and then just share without sharing. Yeah, perfect.
Bellamy Y: Does it matter? Olaz, do?
Benjamin P: You still, can commit? You can do write and connect too, if you want to. But I don't think we'll be writing so.
Bellamy Y: I don't think it's too important for these guys. So active users, these ones check details. This whole thing… type details browser.
Benjamin P: You guys are already getting some insights since you made that connection.
Bellamy Y: Yeah, that's great. Definitely one is… I don't care about the last pieces in July, 30 minutes, but we do want to get this active users by city for sure. Okay? Really doesn't matter too much. Minus the revenue part, we don't really care about revenue. Then a viewer engagement… that's I just sent that organic search. There you go. This one. Views by page title… user retention, core, user engagement, core, user platform, user engagement? Right. User stickiness. Oh, there you go. This one's nice. Don't have sales. Oh, this is super cool. Okay. Yeah, that's it. And I'll send this over to you, right?
Benjamin P: Now.
Bellamy Y: This can be added to the talent acquisition board.
Benjamin P: All right. Well, I will continue working on the map and I will work on pulling in some of that data to match the screenshots that you sent over. So I appreciate that a lot.
Bellamy Y: Great. Yeah, the map will be really cool to have soon. What else? So this has been figured out which is great. But here's a thing that… is now being put into the back burner. And I'm not happy about because… this is the response that we got about the snowflake… bullion fields not coming in… they say that it's just going to be a part of the queue. I need to talk to Jeff and I need to tell him that this is like figuring this out is going to be contingent upon our renewal because if we can't do, this is the most important metric for any home health agencies.

Sarah C: How are you?
Jaran P: Good. How are you… doing well. Nice, nice, excited for the weekend?
Sarah C: Yes, I'm in California home office right now. So I'm ready to go home tonight. Okay?
Jaran P: Nice. Hey, were you out this entire week?
Sarah C: No, I flew in yesterday and I fly home tonight. It's just like a day and a half of work in the office because I'm meeting with our global trainer to work on the training deck for the analyzer.
Jaran P: Amazing. Okay. That's exciting. Yeah, cool. Hey, aish. Hello, everyone.
Sarah C: Hi… I sent y'all a couple of emails yesterday just to kind of level set on where we were, and it would like when I opened up the document to see where we are like on certain… countries, I had no idea that Belgium, France, all of those countries were coming along too. So that's why I sent it to you yesterday and they're all due to us like I think on the eighteenth, all the benchmarks.
Jaran P: Okay. Yeah, that's crazy. Okay. Because so, some of the files on the title, they have different countries there as well. So is the assumption that the benchmarks are the same for those, but the currency symbol is different. I think you're asking them about it or you? Oh.
Sarah C: Oh, you're talking about the middle east, they want to do it in euros?
Jaran P: They want to do it in euros. Oh, they want to do everything in euros.
Sarah C: Those, those three, the Morocco, Algeria, and there was one other country in that benchmark group. He's just said to do it in euros.
Jaran P: Oh, okay.
Sarah C: And then also, I realized euro, I think y'all were right. The euro is before, I don't know why Spain did it after, but the euro because I looked up like currency and all this stuff for every country yesterday and the symbols because Czech Republic was on there and, like it should be before in current currency ways like, so I kind of screwed, I screwed that up. I was wrong guys.
Jaran P: No, that's okay. And it is confusing because when I was checking online, so, how I'm searching it is, let me just double check euro for Spain, financial reporting that's how I was.
Sarah C: Yeah. And then there's yeah.
Jaran P: Because, I thought I saw that it said it was after.
Sarah C: Yeah, I don't know why Spain put it after.
Aishwarya D: Yeah. The way I searched, it gave me before, so I went with before.
Sarah C: I know y'all were right. And I was like, no, that's.
Aishwarya D: okay.
Sarah C: No, and I researched it too because I looked up Swiss francs and all this stuff and like just see how their symbol is just kind of a mess anyways. Yeah. So,
Jaran P: what I'm asking a chat, gpt that in Spain and in most non English speaking european countries, the URL sign is placed after the number with a space ideally a non breaking space between the amount and the symbol.
Sarah C: Yeah, that's weird. Why would language have anything to do?
Jaran P: With it? No idea.
Sarah C: I don't know either well, we can leave Spain as is because… I don't know.
Jaran P: Yeah, because I'm assuming, so they sent you the benchmark values they added it after. So maybe that's just how they're expecting it. Maybe we can just leave it like that until let's just leave.
Sarah C: It. If they want to change it, they'll tell us and I mean, it's not that hard to change it's. Just a pain. But yeah, I mean, once it's Spain's dashboards ready. Well, I'll get their feedback on it.
Jaran P: Okay. Sounds good. So today we wanted to talk about the Spain dashboard. I did the Egypt one, aish, did, Saudi and Iraq. We have those set up. Now, the same with the benchmark file with Saudi and a bunch of other locations there as well. Now, we just searched like whatever the currency symbol is for financial reporting and we used that for Saudi. Now. Is it going to be a similar thing where, how you said for Algeria, Morocco and whatever the other location was, they want it in euros? Does Saudi and other places want it in like one common currency?
Sarah C: I think what I would do is if it's just one country, like Saudi Arabia, let's do it in whatever a Saudi currency is. If it's multiple countries, let's do it in euros.
Jaran P: Okay. So we're going to have to change the Saudi one then aish?
Sarah C: Well, if it's only Saudi or what did y'all do it in?
Jaran P: No, it was, so we did it in Saudi. That was just the first name that came up in the benchmark file. There was like a bunch of other locations.
Aishwarya D: Jaran, can you show her the file?
Sarah C: So we can.
Aishwarya D: Confirm with the naming?
Sarah C: And I can just confirm with Ellie.
Aishwarya D: So, we have added currency symbol for Saudi Arabia as well as Iraq, but we can change it, but I think we can confirm with them first and then make the changes.
Jaran P: Yeah. So for the Iraq file, that was the only one in the name, but for Saudi Arabia, it was the uae, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Bahrain.
Sarah C: Oh, okay.
Jaran P: Or should we just do it in euros?
Sarah C: Just do it in euros. Let's just do it in euros.
Jaran P: Okay. So in that case,
Sarah C: my question back to Ellie was when you wrote the benchmarks, what currency were you thinking of when you did it? And he won't like respond. I was like, what was the currency that? I mean, you put benchmarks in there? Were those euros?
Jaran P: Like,
Sarah C: like it was so weird and then it's kind of like I'm getting like this like misconstrued answer back and I'm like you put dollars like a dollar, I don't know.
Jaran P: That's so funny. Okay. Yeah. And then we'll do it. So we're going to have to do that and do that swap. Aish. So we'll do that. And then I'm thinking for those scenarios, we don't I don't think we need to make if it's all going to be in the same currency and the benchmark values are the same. We can just have a filter at the top that says like country where you can select just those countries.
Sarah C: Sure. Okay.
Jaran P: We can try that out if they want it separately, then we'll make the copy but this will save us a lot of time.
Sarah C: Great. Yeah, that sounds good. Yeah, that works for me. So, can we also look at, well, sorry, I'm jumping ahead.

Scott B: Yeah, the, about that. So, does Jack roll up to you?
Tyler H: Jack's like, we're I dunno, we're at the same level. We all report to Michael, okay?
Scott B: Yeah. So this AI use case, I don't know if you know about it with Jack's building using builder. Yeah. Is he talking about this? Okay? So, he and I have an email chain going back and forth form builder is not part of your existing contract, but I'm just going to give it to you guys because it goes downstream, you know, essentially, it will trigger jobs that will use credits elsewhere. So, got approval just to do it. Who would be my signer for it's? A zero dollar amendment?
Tyler H: Nick? Okay. Yeah.
Scott B: All right. I got, I've got that in approvals on my side right now, and then I'll send it over to Nick for signature. Awesome.
Tyler H: Cool. Thank you. Yeah, I appreciate that.
Scott B: Yeah. Okay. There's no problem. This fall specifically is just to focus on credit usage. We want to do a check in every now and then to make sure you like we're running where we should be. So, does somebody want to bring up their screen and share the dashboard? Let's take a look where you guys are at.
Tyler H: Okay. Yeah. I can do that.
Scott B: Okay.
Tyler H: Give me a second. I've got stuff open.
Scott B: Sure. Okay. Let's go to. So let's actually take a look, open up another tab if you would, and let's go to Domo admin. And then company settings, credit utilization down here. And then let's Qlik on subscription. So we started off with 143,000 credits, Qlik on credit balance right next to it… right here. Yeah. So essentially what we did, we signed a new amendment, a new agreement a couple months back, but it actually didn't start until September first. So, going into September, we're currently sitting at 6,200 credits utilized so far for the month. If we were to break out your total allocation of 143 by month, that breaks down to let me see about 1,178 per month. So, 11,078 per month, which is 11. Let me just do a.
Tyler H: Little over 50 percent.
Scott B: Yeah, a little over 50 percent but we're also over 50 percent through the month. So yeah, 11, seven, seven, eight. I'm going to try to figure out how many credits per day that boils down to so divided by 30. So that's 392 credits per day. Currently, you guys have used six, two, two, three… six, two, two three divided by 19… 327. So you're trending below right now. So, you know, no risk of the total credit allotment is not a monthly allotment, it's an annual allotment. What we're hoping to do is just have these once a month just to make sure you guys are on track. And so far what I'm seeing you're not going to go over your quote unquote monthly allocation. So as long as we can just stay as is there's no concern of going over right now as we enable some more of these use cases, maybe there's some cleanup to be done in other areas just to, you know, free up those credits for some of this AI use case. So that's a thought there. Now, as far as this dashboard, Shana remind me how do we have this powered? Because we want to be able to essentially see trends. So this is the one that is.
Shana B: Yeah. So this is going to show everything. Whereas if you flip back really quick to, the admin section, if you go to credit balance… and then expand the like your usage so far this month and see how we have the different offsets. Like you used 5,500 Ish legacy credits, but you have an offset for that. So I didn't use any standard credits, same with the materialized row, all of these things, the materialized rows, the legacy credits plus your standard. Like all of that is going to show when we flip back tabs and go back to the quick start. So if you were to filter just to current month, it's going to look like you used more because your legacy's in there materialized row, virtual row. So we can filter it out. I would say don't always filter it out. Occasionally, we want to check on this and just make sure you're not doing something that's going over those offsets because if you do anything over will count. But yeah, if we filter that out here, this should be showing everything that is not… part of those offsets.
Tyler H: Okay.
Shana B: If we do some cleanup, I now see there's clear weekly trends, right? We're on weekends, we are running less stuff than you guys previously were in July. So there, that looks pretty obvious that daily trend.
Tyler H: Yep. Okay.
Scott B: What about monthly credits? Have you ever re established that Shana?

Just obviously, I'm in Minnesota with everything that happened last week and stuff like that. It was, I mean, my oldest is 10 and a half and he started asking questions and I was like, oof, you know, they're hearing stuff too. So, yeah, it was tough. There was some hesitation and yeah, it was tough but.

Eric S: be gone for a week. Yeah. Hopefully we get some good weather and get on something, but public lands in Montana, there's a lot of people.
Graham N: Yeah. So we'll see, I can imagine.
Eric S: It's fun. I think, for me, the mountains like not being there there's something just, I look forward to it every fall, but there's also that in the back of your head, you know, we're southwestern Montana. We're getting close to yellowstone, you know, grizzlies and mountain lions and yeah, it's been in the back of my head. We had a couple encounters last year, so I'm like, ooh. Boy.
Graham N: Oh, really? That's crazy.
Eric S: If my airpods die or you stop hearing me, let me know. I'll switch over but.
Graham N: Okay.
Eric S: Yeah, I know obviously, when we talked last, there was a lot of things kind of in flux and progress getting things off the ground and running, trying to figure out kind of what that looks like. How are those things going?
Graham N: They're going well, still a lot of stuff in flux for sure, but we're talking to more customers. Now, a lot of it has been us just kind of slow rolling things while we train models. And, you know, we've been waiting on patent stuff from the patent office for a while from our attorneys and that's finally been submitted. So we're patent pending on our hardware. So a lot of that stuff.
Eric S: Is that's a big step though?
Graham N: Yeah, it is. It is. So we're really excited to finally have that box checked. So we've you know, I had a meeting today with a local… federal agency here about putting our product in and it went really well. And so we're just kind of seeing we're finally like starting to open the floodgates and see what happens. So that's going to change, you know, how we do things pretty quickly which is exciting. I feel like we have all the right tools in place to be able to scale with it. So it's just, we don't know what that's going to actually look like or going to end up being. But, yeah, so we basically have spent a year building and testing and proving concepts, proving ideas, learning. And so it's getting to be that time where, you know, we're having meetings internally about, okay, you know, let's start ramping up how we, you know, building our sales cycle and all that fun stuff that comes along with actually selling a product. So.
Eric S: Yeah. And I'm wondering like is there anything that we can support with materials? You know, I know obviously we're a component, but if there's anything that we can add to or help support you with, let us know in that I'm happy to do it.
Graham N: Awesome. Yeah, I just met. I just met like an hour ago with matt from clearsquare. Oh, nice. And just, he was just updating me on some of the stuff that's been released or going to be released soon, you know, with their mobile app and documents and all the stuff that they've added and all of that's going to be huge for what we do. So we're excited about that. But aside from that, we're not, you know, not really sure what else we really need but I appreciate the offer. I don't know. Yeah, I don't really know what this looks like and when we talk about renewal, like we're going to want to renew, but does it make sense to do it at the same as we did last year or ramp up in anticipation or what it looks like to renew and then add on later and stuff like that? That is all things that I'll obviously need to know from you about what that looks like. So, a lot… of unknowns.
Eric S: When you think about like… the levers to consumption, right? You know, as you start maybe that… sales cycle and bringing customers on, right? I imagine separate instances, right? For each one that gets spun up, is that kind of how you want to structure?
Graham N: It, or?
Eric S: Thinking about.
Graham N: it… separate instances of Domo?
Eric S: Yeah. Like a portal.
Graham N: I mean, so David, when we originally talked with David like a year ago, and he had this vision in his head of how this would go, my understanding was that there would always be the same Domo instance, everything run through that just different connectors. And then we would separate things in clearsquare by workspace. And that. But then, you know, when I worked with the implementation team, you know, momta was walking me through these two separate ways of deploying and different types of embeds. And so I don't know what the best way is. It seems like the cleanest and easiest is to just keep, you know, keep how we've been doing it with one instance and then, but if there's more cost effective because obviously starting being kind of like a startup, we're trying to cut costs as much or at least keep costs down as much as possible. So if there's a way that makes more sense, we're absolutely open to it.
Eric S: Yeah. I mean, I'm… assuming they kind of walk through. And the only reason I asked about the instances is because trying to figure out like the renewal and credits and things like that… each, you would have your main instance, right? And the instance that you provide to the customer, you can tailor the experience however you want.

Yeah, I'm still not sure that, you know, that's the right solution by any means but the write back scheme definitely like, I love the tight integration with databricks and that everything is just running on the underlying platform using permissions from the underlying platform. It's just, you know, such a clean way to do it only have to manage all of that stuff in one place. Yeah… I don't know. I mean, I think it's an interesting tool. I enjoy playing around with it, but, you know, again, with the, I just think commitment that we have already made with our existing platform changing to anything else as, you know, is going to be excruciating. So, but love to be able to see this work.
Scott T: Well,
Chris G: see whether we have a partner that's willing and able to join and help here?
Jordan H: I know we'll see if we're the only people on their call.
Chris G: But, yeah, looking forward to being out in salt lake for a couple of days a week after next there, it sounds like Troy gave direction that he wants pacnet to move back to cosmos DB, which I think could be causing some consternation in the software team given that they just re platformed to mongodb off of cosmos DB because of some performance issues they were having. So that'll be interesting, but I guess they set up an engagement with Microsoft. It's like a two day workshop specific to cosmos DB. And Anil asked if I could attend from the is side. So we'll see.
Jordan H: Interesting.
Chris G: Yeah.
Scott T: Yeah, that's.
Jordan H: gonna be a lot of heartburn for them.
Chris G: Yep. I know they did not love the solution previously. So see if they like it better the second time. Hi, Scott.
Scott T: Hey, Jordan. Hey, Chris, how you doing good?
Jordan H: We're doing well. How are you?
Scott T: Well, I think I'm doing well. I feel like we got our sandbox at least the initial issues worked through.
Chris G: Thank heavens. Yeah… touchdown.
Scott T: Yeah, I do still have some concerns about kind of the architecture we're putting together with the repositories but yeah… I'm just gonna reiterate that as these repositories are built right? The way Domo updates or promotes a repository, it promotes all the content. So if we're creating for example, the naboo sales repository that we just got successfully linked up, right? There's five dashboards. I think lots of cards, when you go and try to promote from the sandbox back into production, it's going to take whatever state all of that content is in the sandbox and it's gonna push it just as it is right back into production. And so, I think it makes the development really tricky if you have to ensure that all of that content is accurate before you hit promote, right? So, for the typical best practices we say for that sort of thing is as small repositories as you can reasonably do, right? So obviously, like I actually talked to a bunch of consultants, some of them even said one to one was what they recommend. I don't think that's maybe realistic here. But if we could like certainly shrink it down, I would.
Chris G: If.
Scott T: there, yeah, if there's dashboards, I would say, you know, maybe if you could just do like one dashboard per repository and if it's not like I know you mentioned like 2000 cards like that one scares me like I'm.
Chris G: having that meeting. I'm having that meeting right after this one, Scott. So yeah. So point taken. You know, I think our initial understanding just maybe, you know, based on, the term repository was that this acted more like a git repo and only pushed the delta changes. And that's why we were kind of taking this monolithic approach. I think, you know, to me what makes the most sense is if we do this project based. So, you know, hey if we have a new project or I guess maybe at the epic level with our ado that, you know, we would just want all of that associated content in one repository and be able to push those items discreetly. So, I think that's probably the right organization level for us. That might mean, you know, a few data sources, a handful of cards and a dashboard or two would be, you know, the max of the content there. But each of the groups has a little bit different way of working. So, my meeting I have after this is with our finance counterpart. He's the one that owns the 2000 cards. And so I'm going to try to brainstorm with him on what is a sensible way to try to break this stuff up into manageable size repositories for sure?
Scott T: So I will say sorry, I'm just going to interrupt one second. I apologize. But with these large repos, right? So the… linked repository, so I guess I just maybe want to have a quick understanding. So for a linked repository… that's where it's really critical to have a small amount, right? But what we could do theoretically, you know, group these 2000 cards into, you know, two repositories and push all of that content into the sandbox as a one time push. Yep, we don't link it up. We just get it into that sandbox so they can start developing on it there. And then as they have content, they're wanting to push back into your production, they would then set up a linked repository from there and promote it just into production. Right now. The potential, the potential issue there is that the content that got initially pushed would no longer be linked and I would recommend actually deleting that content off of your production instance. And then as they have stuff to promote back in, they would create new content, right? So if people have linked cards in the production environment, if they like bookmark them or whatever, once… the finance team, you know, has it fixed so that they can promote it back, they would, it would be creating a new card in ",Consumption Pricing Model,452039.4,Corporate,PACKSIZE.COM,12,Manufacturing,767,$100M to <$250M,Upsell,Sales,2: Determine Needs,Neil McGoldrick,2026-08-27,2023-10-26,2023-10-26,,,,,,0015000000grkrBAAQ

Benjamin P: No, we're good. I just need to get these, proposals through for some of these other accounts, so.
Vince W: Yeah. So, I won't, show him. I won't, show him the level of effort. I had like 265 hours.
Benjamin P: Yeah, I think that was with.
Vince W: A TV.
Benjamin P: Yeah, I mean, it's just, we're gonna be talking about stuff Bellamy already knows about, and we've already talked about it several times. It's just more of a, I think this is, you know, just, you know, to show that we're aligned, I guess.

Ankit S: Was, yeah, I mean, it's like a typical like east coast beach, northeast beach where it's like, you know, boardwalk, carnival… rides, decent… restaurants. Yeah, it was fun. I just love… being by the water. It's nice.
Vince W: Yeah, no, for sure. I like being in the water too.
Ankit S: Yeah. There's actually lots of jellyfish or at least this summer season. Like, there's been lots of jellyfish, like close to the shore and a lot of people have been just getting zapped like all over like not just their feet, and thankfully, like they're not super, poisonous like potent. Yeah, they're not super like venomous or poisonous, I guess, like as other states may have or other coastlines may have. So, yeah. Yeah. How about yourself?
Vince W: Well, I did some work on Sunday, trying to catch up on a whole whack of sows… what else? Yeah, just a bunch of different things.
Ankit S: Yeah. How's the weather this time of year up there? Is it getting a bit cooler?
Vince W: No, dude. It's like it's like where you are, it's like 90 degrees.
Ankit S: Yeah, but I mean, it's not 90 degrees here today. It's like.
Vince W: Actually, it's cooler now, like it was 90 degrees for like the longest time and then yesterday, it went down to like 75.

Vince W: Yeah, like an outdoor fire pizza oven. I think they call it. It's like, o N, I, no. Omni, I don't know something like that.

Vince W: Yeah.
Ankit S: It's wood fired.
Vince W: Yeah, but I, you can take it's portable and you can throw like wood in there and make the real way. But then I just have gas that I just connect to it.

Braxton F: I hear that. I hear that.
Horacio P: In a good busy way.
Braxton F: Good.
Horacio P: As long as what we're doing is what we believe in and, you know, the vision there, the support's there, it's all good.
Braxton F: Couldn't agree more. I think Trent you set this up probably as a follow up from the webinar that we had kind of the new feature, new product roundup. Is that accurate?
Trenton C: Yeah, Horacio, do you mind maybe telling us a little bit about? I know you mentioned worksheets stood out to you. It was something that you wanted to look at possibly improving your guys', workflow. Do you mind telling us a little bit more about that?
Horacio P: Sure. You know, I did join the workshop. I think obviously everything that was mentioned, I think it's great, right? But the one that stood out was the worksheet because I guess, and I'm sure you've seen it with other customers, right? The culture into going into Domo. Only, I would say that a few folks really understand it. A lot of folks still, they like to see the visuals, they like to see the data. But then I'm sorry, they like to see the visuals but they always want to be like, okay, so can I take a look at the data, right? And some folks may actually do their own validation this and that and obviously the way that they're going to do that is in excel obviously, right? So when I saw the worksheet functionality within Domo, I'm like, oh, so this might actually be a great tool for all the internal brokerage non Domo users to start using it more and get more out of it, right? That was kind of like my vision on understanding it and then sharing it with the folks so they can start doing their own validations there. And they can use Domo even more that's kind of like what I was thinking of worksheet. So, yeah. So that's why I requested to see if I could get the beta version and see if we could start testing it out and start sharing it with other folks. That was kind of like the purpose of that email that was sent out to you Braxton. And that was my thought, right?
Braxton F: Sweet. Yeah, I like it I guess to kind of validate. So you're looking for or sort of looking at this capability which I'll sort of share my screen here wherein you've got… the table and you can really easily rearrange things like you would in excel and you kind of like you're filtering. And then if I wanted to add a calculated column, for example, I can do that here. I've got like my max minus my min here as my function and this is kind of the general capability and then maybe even having some charts and things like that powered on it that's kind of what you're looking for, right? Yeah.
Horacio P: That's what I saw from the video and I thought, oh, so this could be useful, you know, as an initial, you know, intro for Domo because a lot of folks, you know, they might get the email and they still want to see reports sent over to them in excel and this and that I'm like dude, you know… stop exactly, stop using and managing your business with outlook and emails and the data's there. Just go get it. I mean, you'll be a lot more productive. But anyway, so, yeah.
Braxton F: A.
Horacio P: scalable.
Braxton F: Environment and all of those good things that we know about. Okay. Yeah, I mean, I would say this is probably a good fit then. I think we've kind of invited Casey on as he's kind of the keepers, the keys as it relates to, you know, getting requests for these types of beta features. I'm not exactly sure where we are in with this particular feature in beta. I just have lost track. I think it was part.
Casey D: of the September release last week as far as releasing for beta, but.
Braxton F: For beta, yeah. So I would just say like we probably also want to keep Chris and like the Domo sort of bi council or group in the loop and make sure that like wherever we turn this on, everyone's okay with turning it on. I think Horacio you had mentioned like, are there implications on credit usage for this particular feature? I believe these are just treated as cards, more or less sort of table cards. So I don't think that there's implications when we get into this, the kind of next phase of this type of tooling where it's more data capture, I think those will be counted as data set updates in the future, but for the capabilities we looked at today, I think those will just be… primarily, you know, considered visualizations.
Horacio P: Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Because I mean, when I was thinking about having them to use Domo and do their own calculations and everything, you know, kind of share the knowledge. But if it was going to be a credit, a high credit usage, then it would have been the whole purpose, right? So that's what I was asking. So. Okay.
Braxton F: Yeah, yeah, of course. And I think when you had sent the email and asked, I thought it was maybe related to like data input and update. But since it's more on this like visualization side, yeah, I don't foresee credits being used for this.
Horacio P: Okay, cool.
Casey D: Horacio, I put in the chat, the beta registration form. Unfortunately, we ask users to register every year just so that we can keep it current and up to date. But it's really simple. Let me know if you have any questions on it.

William M: It was great. Except you weren't there, Steve, I know I.
Steve B: tried to pull it off and I couldn't… it was good though. It was valuable.
William M: Absolutely. Yeah, good.
Shane W: Everyone.
Dylan J: hey, Shane. Good morning. Doesn't sound Shane like they have anything that's top of mind. Was there any specific place you wanted to start today? I know we had a couple items in the data assembler and determining where tags show up and things like that. Do you want to start with any of that or do you want to start somewhere else?
Shane W: Yeah. So, one of the things that we talked about was cleaning up your instance in terms of these data sets that are… relatively old that aren't even being used. But there's hesitation because, you know, you never, without really knowing the data, you don't want to just delete things and then say, man, I wish we would have had that. So, I talked to engineering about or not engineering, but our support team and asked them what they recommend… and, you know, I think there was a couple of suggestions that were brought up in terms of capturing… all of this data. You know, we could take it and, you know, do a one time write to like your azure. So, and the size of the data in your system, like the size of all the files that you guys have is 50 terabytes of data. So it's relatively large. And so there's it's 50 terabytes, and then we can compress it and it gets down to, you know, 10, five to 10 terabytes of data that we can, that it's smaller when it's zipped. So, anyways, so, so that was, the size of the data was 50 terabytes. And, and the thought is we could have, potentially have our engineering team or support team do like a one time, dump of the data into like an S3 bucket. And the question is if you guys have anything like that in your, if you guys have access to like an S3 bucket, but we could put all the data there and then, you have it all backed up and then we can, from there, you know, we could go and then we can start cleaning up and not worry about losing any data because we have it all backed up. And if you ever need anything, you can go back and just grab it. And so, we're wondering, I was wondering if you guys have like an S3 bucket or something like that, we could push the data to. I'll take the silences. No… I know you guys talked about having, not azure but, kind… of like a, what is it? What is Microsoft's onedrive?
William M: Oh, yeah, we do have a corporate onedrive. And.
Shane W: the other option is to, you know, we could just, you could just download it to a drive too without like, a, like… a drive on your computer. So, like if you guys got like an external drive, we could potentially, we could have a script that goes through and you guys just run it on your, just like a python script that you would run, on a little computer and it could go, and grab the data, pull it down and put it onto, your hard drive, a hard drive, and back it up. That would be another option, that, we could do as well and that's that would be fairly straightforward to do. But.
William M: we're talking… 50 terabytes or 10.
Shane W: Well, it would live as 10 terabytes but, it would, I think we can compress it on the fly,
William M: And so,
Shane W: it would kind of be, but, it would, I don't think we can compress it before, we download it. I have to look at that and see if there's a way that we can compress those files and then you can just download the compressed files because that would be much faster than, than downloading 50 terabytes but yeah, it's I mean, it's a lot of data, right? So, I don't know, I don't know… what your connection is. I could do some tests too and find out like what the average download speed would be if we were to just start to download some of, those files, but it would take, it would take a while.

Scott B: Not the healthiest?
Sam D: Option?
Scott B: My team did a team lunch today and we did all you can eat sushi and I'm regretting it.
Sam D: That sounds awesome.
Scott B: It was good. I just went too hard.
Sam D: Yeah. Do you do raw sushi or do you just do cooked? You do? Okay. All right. Very cool. I can't do the raw. I'll do cooked. I'll do any cooked sushi, but raw.
Scott B: You got to bench it out, man. It's good.
Sam D: Very cool. All right. Well, it looks like we got some folks coming… in. I was actually just on a call with Jeff, so he'll be joining us shortly. I see we got, Ben, welcome, Ben. Is you're probably not familiar with him, but he is the head of strategy here at ocean state job lot, Ben, Scott and Ashish are make up the account executive team and customer success management team of Domo and are the ones that I'm usually engaging whenever we have a question or a problem. So, I brought Ben here today… because we have a significant amount of interest in enabling or unlocking AI in terms of, you know, what I would argue is probably one of our, if not the most important solutions we have in Domo today, which is the store spotlight, which I know you guys have heard of and are familiar with and have seen. So I'm hoping what we'll be able to do today is determine how to unlock AI… with store spotlight in the backdrop. So we'll give some folks maybe another minute or so to hop in. Do you have your resources guys?
Scott B: Can really share from our team? I'm not sure if Jan is going to be able to make it or not. But the, maybe… I'll wait for the rest of your team to join before I jump into this. Yeah.
Sam D: Looks like we got Jeff. We got Lauren. We got Tyler… really all that's left is Sam. So I would say let's get started because we only have a half an hour. Sam can always catch up. Okay? So we're good on our end. Yeah.
Ben P: You might have to say a few words just to end this session in something a little bit more tangible.
Sam D: Yeah, I was going to suggest that, please do Ben.
Ben P: Okay. Thanks. Hi, everyone. As you know, we've been on this journey around performance management over the last year and a half. If you guys have seen, I'm assuming everyone's seen store spotlight. Have you seen the latest iteration of what we built?
Scott B: I think so. The one that was released out to all new stores a couple months back, and then some of the iterations the ability.
Sam D: To look at that kind of stuff.
Ben P: That was released a couple days ago. Yeah, no, it does not. Yeah. So we released kind of this is our fourth phase of development into the store spotlight. And basically, I want to just take a few minutes to just outline the overarching vision which has kind of evolved a little bit over the last couple months as we've gotten deeper into this tool. What we're trying to do is ultimately to empower our store team leaders to be more effective managers of their stores, to drive overall business performance, to get them actual insights and data in their hands that's easy to use, easy to understand, easy to act upon… what we have right now. In this latest phase in development, we've basically identified all, but maybe one of the different performance indicators that we're most passionate about that we believe are indicative of store performance. We've identified the KPIs, we've laid out the data. Everything's like easy to understand but it's still kind of distributed. So if a store wants to kind of understand how am I doing well? You know, they can go to these different views and drill in, but they still don't have an answer to that high level question. They still have to use their own intuition to answer it and to decide ultimately, where should I spend my time and attention to have the greatest business impact to drive performance? We'd like to make that much more transparent and actionable. So, what we're working on now is in the next phase of development is bringing all these disparate performance measures together into some sort of centralized dashboard which will ultimately have kind of some weighting associated with it. So we're going to build a weighted scorecard. Everything's going to collapse down to one number, which will answer the question. How am I doing? And not only that we'll still understand what that one number is comprised of and what components are driving that number up or down the most. So it's oh, OK. Maybe I'm ranked, you know, 100 and eightieth out of 180 stores. But I still want to know what can I be working on to drive the most impact to overall store performance. So in this case, maybe it's like, you know, I'm a middle of the pack but I want to get into the top quartile, what should I be focusing on? Well, you're doing fine in sales, you're doing fine in labor, you suck in merchandising as evidenced by all this data. So, and here are the actual insights you can take to improve your merchandising score and therefore improve overall store. Performance. And so that is the direction we want to go in. We've kind of laid out the board. Now, now we have to aggregate and weight it all together. And in the back end, you know, I want to make sure that the data is organized in a way that allows us to enable some of these advanced AI features.
Scott B: To.
Ben P: allow our store team leaders to have ultimately a conversation with Domo AI, to ask the AI, a very simple question. What can I do to have the biggest impact on my store's performance? What should I do? What should I do today? That's the direction I want to take this in and, you know, we need you guys to help enable it. Any questions?
Scott B: No, I was just capturing notes. So I think the vision and the guidance from the store perspective, I completely understand the route that you're wanting to take this and how having just a single number that the store is working towards. And if you guys end up doing is like ranking by store number one out of however many stores, then they ca",Consumption Pricing Model,218565.0,Corporate,OCEANSTATEJOBLOT.COM,4,Retail,5600,>=$1B,New Logo,Sales,Closed Lost,Scott Bartholomew,2025-08-08,2025-04-04,2025-04-07,,,,,2025-08-12,0015000000nODLXAA4

Maddison J: There we go.
Debbie S: Sorry, it took me a minute. Zoom is not necessarily our preferred choice. We usually tend to use teams here. Don't worry. We forget that sometimes it automatically puts me on mute. It does take a minute to kind of get it all together.
Maddison J: No worries at all. Well, thank you so much for joining. I'm Maddison, I met you via email and I've included my colleague Phil Stewart, him, and I work to manage the relationship with Domo and home depot, and I will let him introduce himself.
Debbie S: Thanks.
Phil S: Maddison and Debbie. Great to meet you. I'm Phil Stewart enterprise account executive here at Domo. Been here about three and a half years. I've been working with home depot pretty much since I got here the whole time they officially became a customer about three years ago. As of January. And so, mostly, I've been working with supply chain, product engineering as well. I always love meeting new people at home depot like yourself. If there's any way we can help, right? I have a pretty heavy… background. Is that… is that on my side or?
Debbie S: Wait a minute, okay?
Phil S: I think it's better now, I was getting like some whooshing sounds or something. But.
Debbie S: Yeah. So… I think through Mike Maddison, he introduced me but I, my name is Debbie straw. I'm here. I'm the director of our property management team, which is part of our real estate team.
Phil S: Okay.
Debbie S: We, I've been with the company over 25 years, not necessarily in this role but in some form of working on the real estate side of our properties, what we do in our, of our real estate portfolio. So, now, I currently oversee a team that handles all of our real estate portfolio across the enterprise. So, retail supply chain, office locations across the U. S, Canada, and some international a little bit too. Yeah, kind of manage. Obviously, our primary focus is more on the leasing side. Yeah. So deal with, you know, in house, like I said, we manage and have a platform that we use, called lucernix. Yeah, that interfaces with our finance systems, and other systems that we have platforms in the company. But we manage again, making sure rent is paid every month, obviously, rent adjustments, lease renewals, and making sure the data on those, leases and other properties we actually do own as well, operating agreements, making sure that, you know, any obligations that home depot has is kind of managed through that system.
Phil S: Yeah.
Debbie S: And doing that, so that's kind of again, our kind of bread and butter is lease renewals, and rent adjustments and rents and stuff. And so forth. And like I said, our, the service system does interface with, our finance system, sap. So we have that interface together to help generate and pay out rent payments, and so forth. So, it's kind of again a little, a level of, you know, what my team does along with other tasks that they deal with. And so forth. Yeah.
Phil S: No, I appreciate the background. Yeah, crazy story. I, the first job I ever had in software was at accruant, that owns lucernex. So, I'm very, very familiar, with the leasing world, and with, with lucernex. Did you ever go to any of the, like their conferences that they do?
Debbie S: I have not gone, we actually have a designated like lucernex administrator for our, for the team. Again, she doesn't do just, we kind of integrated her, you know, through the parents' help, but lucernex doing not just property management but also a little bit of project management. So, as we do our real estate development, there's some interfaces with other applications that we use it for. So, we kind of have it trying to centralize it, I guess, but she is, the point person that tends to go to those meetings more. So, I just came back though from the nrta, conference in Orlando last week.
Phil S: Oh, okay.
Debbie S: I went to, I had never been before as well. Of course, Kurt was there along with some others, costar and some other folks that were there as well. In doing that, but yeah, she's usually the primary person that goes and keeps up with the technology stuff and things that we're starting to spin off her. She wasn't available today to do her call otherwise, I would have had her join as well. But I know that, you know, one of the things that, as a company as a whole that they're pushing and kind of talking about is the whole AI functionality piece and how we can leverage using AI to help create efficiencies and things within our jobs across the entire enterprise, not just with my team and doing things. So, that was kind of, you know, the thought process and so that's kind of turned up and Maddison had reached out, I figured it would be a good opportunity kind of just hear a little bit about your product and, you know, talk a little bit about that and see if there is any opportunities?
Phil S: Absolutely. So that was kind of my thought on agenda was, of course, want to learn, you know, for your role, what would be, you know, relevant… kind of walk you through some gist of the current home depot use cases to me. And I'm, always a visual learner of like it's good to just know, well, how are other people using it? That'll help me know how I might use it, right? Kind of thing. So, I'll give you just some things here that we see at home depot in the background and then go over, you know, just some questions to learn more about what could be, what could be interesting. And then I'm happy to touch on like some AI agents and, seeing that a lot inside of home depot, it's definitely, we're working on several, you know, projects with the team on building agents and other things as well. I'm seeing some really bad audio. I don't know if it's, if you might can, I don't know what that is.

So, Dena will just go over some topics such as data governance and gather those requirements so that she can get the roadmap ready for the proposal.
Tom H: Perfect. Give me one second. Guys. I'm getting a quick call. I want to make sure this isn't anything important. Just one second. Okay. Sorry about that. We're good.
Jenna H: No worries. Did you have a good weekend?
Tom H: Yeah, yeah. Yeah. It was pretty fun. My sister in law came in town and then she and my wife went to the, my chemical romance concert. So that was really exciting for the two of them because it's like they went to a show when they were in like high school. So, now, like 10 years later or what? 15 years later or whatever they get to see them on their like Reunion tour, which is really exciting.
Jenna H: That's awesome. They went to that show and I spent my Saturday night at a Ja rule and Nelly concert.
Tom H: Oh, really neat.
Jenna H: Which was quite a throwback.
Tom H: yeah, sounds like it. It was a great time.
Jenna H: Though. Okay. So today, like Ivan said, we're going to talk. I want to wrap up just some requirements gathering about like the front end user experience that's happening in your instance as well as some governance and like furthering education just because these are all things that the adoption engine program is really seeking out to support. And I know these are things like you've talked with your account team about. So… let me… so when I'm looking at your instance overall, there's a lot of content in here. I mean, I'm seeing over 1,600 dashboards and starting to see some stuff built out in app studio which is exciting, definitely still feels like we're dipping our toes into that. So when we talk about dashboards… in here, do you have any systems in place to monitor how users are looking at that? Is there anything that you or anybody in your team checks regularly to ensure that the… content's being engaged with that's answering the questions it needs to answer?
Tom H: So I think it's kind of two parts. In that one, we do leverage the usage information that comes out of domostats to take a look at kind of high level metrics in terms of views and who those users are stemming from. But in terms of answering the question whether or not people are getting value out of it, usually that's something that's more subjective. I think I feel like the typical pattern, right? Jesse and Liam is that we would kind of let this dashboard be in the user's hands for a little bit and then do kind of an informal circle back. Or as, you know, they have adjustments that they want to request, they push those over to us. But there's not a programmatic way of answering the question. When someone is viewing this dashboard, what exactly are they doing on it? And I think that's because we don't have a lot of users who open up cards out of dashboards, they're more consuming it as one unit. So we just see the view, I believe, but we don't get like, where are they looking? Where are they clicking? Things like that?
Jenna H: Okay.
Tom H: And then one thing that I think that we try and do that maybe helps this on the creation side is to walk through kind of what the major questions that people would be looking for from a reporting standpoint, and then keep in mind on our team when we're developing it, you know, can we answer that question? And then those are kind of the follow ups that come as we finish developing. You know, we'll say, okay, well, I know when we talked about the requirements, it was important that we're able to show X by y or Z dimension. Does this work for the questions that you want to ask about those groups? Awesome. Jesse, Liam, feel free to chime in here. You guys are probably closer to the handoff to the users than I am. So if there's anything you want to add, yeah, I think that kind of covers my experience with.
Jesse P: It, yeah, I was about to agree. It is pretty much exactly the process that happens. Okay?
Tom H: So,
Jenna H: please correct me if I'm wrong. You three are the primary content creators for all of greenway health and Domo or is there anybody?
Tom H: It would be us plus one more member of our team, Surya who's on India time. So, unfortunately, it's not easy for him to make these calls during the afternoon in the late morning. And then that forms the team, right? Myself. And then, and then Liam, Jesse, Surya, on top of that, there are a couple of users that I think are kind of de… facto creators maybe for their departments, right? Like I'm thinking about in pto, in our development and technology organization, there's a couple of users who Surya works with and, you know, he's given them the level of trust to create cards on data sets that he curates summer in sales, is a sales ops manager who's kind of in a similar spot. Tabby. So, yes, tabby is another great example inside pto… but I think that that's not really something that we've formalized. It's more like we've found people that we trust and who are also interested in trying to learn how to create content. And so, we kind of give them a brief little primer on, you know, okay, this is how you create cards. If you need data, you let us know, don't try and go find it yourself. And then we give them a more often than not a like front end editor only custom role that we built that gates off the back end but allows them to create on pages that they have access to.

Kevin H: I'm doing great. How are you?
Ivan S: Good. From our side, we're just missing Jenna as soon as she joins, we can get started and start going over the KPIs that you have. So far. Okay? Actually, she's here so we can get started.
Jenna H: Everybody.
Kevin H: Hello, Jenna.
Jenna H: Hi. How's it going? So, I think… right before we jump into Kevin, the document that you put together, I had some questions about some of the data that's powering the falls tracker. Okay? So we were kind of hoping we could maybe dive into that with you for about 15 minutes, okay? And then we'll switch to your high level view of what you've put together… and maybe understand like what we're still waiting on there, but I do think we talked with Ed a little bit last week and we do want to try to find a way for one of the use cases of this project to help see if there's any ways we can help make the automation of either the falls tracker or the JL dashboard, huh… become a little bit more adopted by more users because you've got some great information out there. But because we don't have a ton of user adoption for various reasons, we want to see if there's something if we can solution something that'll help to… either remind people to fill out information about the fall incidents or, you know, stuff along those lines. So that's we just kind of want to have a little bit of a conversation about the data that powers that. And just see if there's a way we can help automate some of that for you.
Kevin H: Okay.
Scott T: Yeah. So, thanks, Jenna. I would say that, you know, what we've identified so far is that there's the JL outlier report and then there's the falls, is there also an outlier report on the falls dashboard?
Kevin H: No. So yeah, a fall is not technically categorized as an outlier, as far as I know. So that's going to be exclusively for that JL dashboard?
Scott T: Gotcha. So then when we're looking at that data, I think what I had written down was that the… issue with it is that the nurses are getting notified or asked for the reason of these outlier events too… late or essentially like there's too much of a gap between when the event occurs and when they're being asked why the event occurred. And oftentimes they either don't remember why it happened or maybe it's like they're into their shift and potentially just rushing through and just filling in a column and not really providing good value with the data they're putting in, right? And so trying to just kind of brainstorm what potential scenarios could we provide that would give a more timely collection of the data? So that way, hopefully the data that is collected has more of an impact on our analysis, right? Yeah. And so… can you walk me through maybe what system… is powering that outlier event or how is that outlier event getting identified and currently getting passed into the nursing? Yeah.
Kevin H: So let me take a second and actually just pull up the data set really quickly and then I can kind of go over some of the technical portions and then I can give you a little bit of the actual kind of workflow that the nurses go through. Aisha, I'm going to lean on you a little bit because you've actually kind of sat with the nursing team and seen how they actually go through the process. So if I say anything wrong, please feel free to correct me. Let's see. We have, let me make sure this is the right one. Okay? And then I will share.
Aisha A: Sorry, I was on mute before Kevin happy to help. And this might be a separate conversation or might be part of this one. I am doing an analysis with the nursing team on not just JL but all of their processes and all of the analysis. What's come out is they're spending about close to 80 hours a week of manual labor work related to data coming out of PCC. So there's a lot of data in PCC that it's not they're… extracting data out of PCC into spreadsheets to visualize it the way they want to visualize it. And it's coming out of like multiple reports from PCC.
Kevin H: Okay.
Aisha A: Do you want to include that as a part of this conversation? Or is that separate? So?
Kevin H: Let's leave PCC separate for now, just in context of JL because we can get to PCC when we start talking about the false tracker dashboard that's where that data comes from.
Aisha A: Okay, perfect.
Kevin H: Sorry, really quick. So, when you say they spend 80 hours a week, are you talking about the entire nursing team? Are you talking about nursing leadership or the nurses themselves?
Aisha A: The entire nursing team, including leadership, MDS, team, admissions, nurses?
Kevin H: Okay. So the jnl alarm history report. So jnl is our nurse call system. It is a locally hosted server on site. It's… the server is one part of it, right? All of these alarms that you're seeing here. Every single one of these alarms connects back to the server. When let's take for example, a call bell, there is a pull cord next to a patient's bed. And if they have an issue and they need a nurse's assistance, they'll go. And then they'll pull that cord. So our jnl system logs when that cord was first pulled. And then once the alarm has been resolved or the alarm has been reset, it also logs that event. So for call bells for pull cords, and for pendants, this is the case of how those alarms function where there is a triggering event, there is some time that passes. And then there is a closeout event of that alarm being reset back into an active or a passive status. Bed. Pads and chair pads are a little bit different. Whereas they are triggered when pressure is released from the pad itself. When pressure is released, that's when the start time starts for those. And then when pressure is placed back on the pad, that is when the alarm is reset. So that's just kind of like the high level technical overview of what's happening in our data here… we have the location or the room number of where that alarm ",Consumption Pricing Model,72964.57,Corporate,WCBAY.COM,3,Healthcare & Health Services,415,$50M to <$100M,Upsell,Blank,2: Determine Needs,Eric Smith,2025-12-12,2025-03-24,2025-03-24,,,,,,0015000000uWr4mAAC

Hello?
Ryan H: Hi, Jessica.
Jessica P: Good to see you guys, Vinit. It's been a while. How are you doing?
Vineet R: Doing well, you?
Jessica P: I'm doing good, you know, just taking it one week at a time, enjoying the summer and my baby turned one a few weeks ago. So it's crazy having a wild one year old, trying to keep him tame is an adventure.
Vineet R: People talk about a one year old being wild for a few.
Nik K: More years.
Jessica P: Well, happy.
Ryan H: Belated birthday to your one year old.
Jessica P: Thank you. Yeah. No, it's crazy. I think I am in for a wild next few years because he's already just wanting to push all the limits and if there's like a ledge, he wants to sit on it. If there's something high, he wants to push it off like he's just trouble.
Vineet R: Well, that's what you think it's adventure for him. He's just exploring everything new, right?
Jessica P: Yep. It's so funny. I'm like you have a whole backyard of grass to play in but he'll go to like the concrete stairs and just dangle on the edge. I'm like dude, are you trying to distress me out? Or like there's a whole yard, but he wants to go to wherever the rocks are and just put all the rocks in his mouth. I'm like, okay.
Vineet R: This reminds me of my young one who, when he was a toddler we took him to one of these parks out in one of the malls and they had the artificial turf, right? And they had all these different play things for little kids and on the side, they had the gravel and the river rock and stuff that's the only place he would go to and not the usual places. So, I think they like.
Jessica P: To explore that's. So true. Yeah, that's exactly. There's a park pretty much in our backyard and they have it's like one of the biggest parks in Utah. And then they also have a splash pad. So it's like a river and water features like everything a kid could ever imagine. But my son will just go to the rocks that's the landscaping and just play with the rocks. I'm like, okay?
Vineet R: Just enjoy this time, Jessica.
Jessica P: Yeah. Oh, trust me, I'm trying to soak it in the first year has already gone by way too quick. So I just, I don't know it's sad, but I do enjoy it for sure.
Vineet R: Cool.
Jessica P: Well, it's great to see you guys. I know there's a few others from the team that I think are joining, so we'll give them a second to jump on. But I know on our last call, we kind of went through this adoption program kickoff we talked about a lot of different items that would maybe be top of mind to focus the efforts of this team towards. And I know there were some internal conversations that were going to take place. I'm guessing that's why we have Vineet here. So, I guess wanting to check in, just how are these internal conversations going? Is there an area that stands out that we can kind of jump into? What are your guys' thoughts?
Ryan H: Yeah, we did have some conversations internally and I brought Vineet on today so that we can get him up to speed on the program. I think he may have some questions as well. Then from there, we can talk about timing and next steps and so on.
Jessica P: Fantastic. All right. Well, I know Juliana just jumped on. I will kind of hand it over to Juliana and Brian. We're just going to get Vineet up to speed on the program and then we'll talk through next steps.
Juliana J: Sounds good to us. Cool. So I can run through a couple slides, maybe just on the program overall to do a quick introduction for you, Vineet on the program. Does that sound good?
Vineet R: Yeah, perfect.
Juliana J: All right. Cool. So, let me just… sorry, I'm adjusting my screens here. They're not moving where I want them to. Okay? All right. Awesome. Can you see my screen?
Nik K: Yes.
Juliana J: Okay, perfect. So Vineet, we did go through this with the team last time. So I'll do a quick overview for you just on our adoption engine program. So we really want to partner with you and your team to help you get full value out of Domo. The program is no additional cost to you. So what we started with the team last time and would love to continue is going through some discovery work and figuring out kind of where your pain points are with Domo right now, things that might be holding your team back, maybe expanding into some other departments, things like that. Those are all items that we can help you tackle. We can do this by either walking you through doing kind of like teach to Fish sessions or scoping out like a full use case and implementing it with Domo being the lead on that. So we have our technical team. So Brian and Nick from our team, they're both excellent consultants and they would be your dedicated team. We have additional resources we can bring in. We also have a lot of training resources as well. Things that might usually need to be paid for you have available to you through this program as well. So I will stop, I just said a lot of words. So feel free to ask any questions.
Vineet R: Yeah. A couple of quick ones. Number one, what is the duration of this program? And number two, is it on a specific schedule or is it more on an ad hoc basis? Plus also what is the level of time commitment needed from our team?
Juliana J: Those are all really great questions. So the duration we would call it like a program graduation and that's something that we'd figure out together with you. So we'd build out a roadmap here and we'd kind of figure out what your priorities are and figure out a timeline with you. Time commitment from your team is something we can also figure out together. So it's super collaborative if you guys only have, you know, twice a month that we can meet and dedicate time that's fine. And maybe there's some stuff that we can do on the background. So it wouldn't be as much of a time commitment from your team if you want to be more hands on, you have more time, we can spend more time with your team and have them be more involved. Does that answer your question?
Vineet R: Yes, it does. I think what I understand from this is there's flexibility built into this and it is on our schedule that we can make this work.
Juliana J: Absolutely. Yep.
Vineet R: Okay.

Phil S: How's it going Bryce?
Brice W: Oh, pretty good.
Phil S: Awesome. I made it… furious. Yes… I made a few edits to the slide just to give you a heads up because I know you'll be the one, you know, kind of talking through it. I just added like a few icons of like to illustrate our point of like SPS and, you know, phone and email kind of, you know, painting the picture of where, you know, Domo fits in.
Brice W: Okay. You know, I would even say that sample tracking. I think that's going to be in the new system. Also. I looked at that slide real quick. I'm going to say it's in there because we still don't know what it looks like. Yeah, and they have to, if they have to work in one system, then it's going to have to report out to report out to cbx. So it's fine having it in there.
Phil S: Yeah. I think the goal I mean, anything that we're 100 percent sure the PLM won't do like that's. What we want to do, you know, phase one, Pick raw and I wanted to, yeah, I haven't heard back from Jeff yet on the regulatory piece. Do you know if he's in the office this week or I don't know if he was out?
Brice W: I don't know. I can't remember if this week is their fall break or not?
Phil S: I'll have to look around. Yeah, I know a lot of people have been out but, well, yeah, if you talk to him that's I want to set up like a separate Lane, you know, to just talk like, you know, the regulation projects, you know, that's and I just want to make sure we gather all those requirements. Hey, Mike. Hey, Phil, how are you? Doing? Pretty good? How about yourself? Good. Yeah, very good. Awesome. Don and Bryce and con. All right. Very good. Yeah, we've got Dan roden on who, and then let's see waiting on is Umair on in teams. I can never see y'all okay. Sorry. Yep. I'm here in teams in zoom. It kind of keeps everybody together. But in my teams, I haven't figured that out yet where I can see everybody there. He is. Umair, okay. Got it. Awesome. Well, we'll get started. Thanks again for having us on site. That's always great, you know, to meet in person and just, you can learn so much faster, right? Just, you know, being in person, hearing feedbacks. So we appreciate that. It feels like a, you can really accelerate forward. So what we thought, Mike, to your point, you know, on site is we wanted to have Bryce just start with going through current process, like current workflows. We'll ask, you know, some verification questions. And really the whole objective here is let's figure out what we're 100 percent sure is not going to be in the new PLM and do that, you know, as a phase one, right? And focus there. And then we'll provide, you know, we can provide more of a demo of the figma of what we're proposing. And then also, you know, talk some of the pricing. We've been able to reduce some of the scope, you know, just based on that feedback so that we can get started on a phase one. Does that sound good as far as agenda? Anything? Yeah, let's do it. Awesome. Bryce, I'll let you kick us off and just kind of walking through and, sorry, we'll probably interrupt you with some questions as we go, but just want to walk through current state.
Brice W: Yeah. So, Mike, when we started this the first time, we were still working waiting for our time for that work package three on with trabion on what our system would look like. So when we built the original statement of work, we were like, okay, if you look at that top row there that's the entire onboarding process in a nutshell, you know, you award the product, you collect all the data for it, then you start grouping it for testing, you test it, you finalize everything and then you got your ecrs. So when we started this, we didn't really know where everything was. And the original quote was really kind of taking it from grouping and going through change management with ecrs and things like that. Now that we've gone through work package three, we've seen what not seen. We've heard what's possible. We've discussed what it'll look like in the new system. Now, we've kind of focused the demo side to really focus on the operation of testing the product which happens right now outside of flex with the SPS. So if you kind of think about our process, now, we go into flex and award everything, the suppliers go into flex and enter in all the data. And then when I say we home depot for award. When we get to grouping, that's where product engineering comes in and we assign all the grouping and how we're going to test it and stuff like that.
Phil S: That.
Brice W: From what I see in cbx so far that's going to still happen in cbx, like the way the system runs and everything, we're still going to want home depot and the supplier to group everything in cbx. So once the grouping is done, that's really where Domo… is going to play with the statement of work is. So the grouping's done, the trf's been released. Now, they're ready to test. So the Domo platform would be basically sample tracking. Potentially. I left it on here just because I'm not 100 percent sure if it's easier. I want to keep the SPS in one system. So if we have to do some kind of sample tracking to feed cbx, great. If we don't like cbx's sample tracking, we use it here. Then using the test line and protocol library, we perform the testing based on what was designed at grouping. And then once the testing's done, we can in the Domo say that, you know, product testing finished passed and then that can feed back into cbx which would flip toll gates and things like that. So we're kind of shrinking the scope of the environment that Domo would be into. Is that current outside process where the SPS are doing testing all on their side, if that kind of makes sense?
Phil S: And Bryce, sorry, can you also elaborate a little bit on because my understanding even during award and data collection, when we're communicating with the SPS and the supplier, can you touch on? Because I think that's a big part of the value that Domo would provide is like streamlining that communication. Having it all in one place. Is that even when you're in that portion, there's still phone calls and emails. Is that, is that correct?

Good morning. Hey, everybody. Good morning. We only have 30 minutes. So I wanted to kind of just jump into things if that's okay. I have some questions that I want to ask and kind of get your insights on how things work, so that we can code… things a little bit better. But I want to show you what the app is looking like. And then we can jump into some of those questions. Let me pull up the app that we have here. I don't know… let's see if I. So, I think I talked about this a little bit before that. I'm doing this in the dev environment that I have before I put it into your environment. But so this basically will be what it is. I'm going to split this into two parts right now. It's in one app. So there'll be a upload invoices. So you'll take your invoices and you'll just Qlik on choose files and you'll be able to select the invoices and give it a batch name if you want. And then we'll upload those into Domo. And then Domo will take all of those and parse them out and… kind of generate the, it will generate the journal entry or the post for that invoice. And then, and then you can go in and then you will be able to review those. So it takes a few minutes for it to process the invoices and for it to make it. So it'll kind of just be churning in the background waiting for it. But once they're done, you'll start to see in here, there'll be a dropdown of all of the invoices… and you can kind of toggle between your invoices or all the invoices that have. So if you've loaded the invoices, it'll be just your invoices and if you want to see all of them that are in there, you can. And then in this screen down here, we'll be able to see the invoice here and be able to see what, the entry is on this side. And then we'll be able to actually update the entry. So like if something got coded incorrectly, you'll be able to make adjustments to that, and then we can submit it for approval. And then it will get posted into mip. So that's the process that I'm working on, to get these loaded. And this is kind of what it'll look like in general, it'll be it'll look a little bit nicer than this. This is just a framework. But from what I described, what are your thoughts? There? Anything that stands out that will be an issue?
Sabrina P: No, I mean go.
Shane W: Ahead, Michelle, go ahead Serena.
Sabrina P: I mean, it looks like pretty basic right now. You know what I mean? It does look difficult. I just presume that when eventually when you have the main dashboard, you will have like a clearer picture of what you have uploaded, et cetera, to then transfer over to mip.
Shane W: Yeah. So, and what would that look like in your mind? Like what would you expect, that to look like? Like how would you want to see that the data that you're going to load into mip or push into mip?
Sabrina P: I mean, if you look like at normal dashboards, right? You can… see for instance, like the vendor name, the invoice number, the… amount et cetera.
Shane W: Sure.
Sabrina P: And then obviously, you can straight away see if there is an attachment or if there isn't or if there isn't if it's missing stuff like that.
Shane W: Yep. Yeah. And once this, the app is a little bit farther along, you will be able to see all the invoices that have been loaded. And then also, you'll be able to select it in. This dropdown will be a dropdown of the invoices. And when you Qlik on, it will show the original invoice here. And then this side will be the… post for the ap or the ap entry, essentially that we're going to calculate. So that's I know it's kind of I'm hoping that we can envision that, but that makes sense. What you're saying in terms of like we want to be able to see what the original invoice was and be able to see what the entry is, so that we can just double check and make sure that it looks correct?
Sabrina P: Michelle, correct me if I'm wrong. I mean, I think for us, when we go into the dashboard, the main dashboard before we import it into mip. Obviously, we want the approval flow et cetera. I think it would be handy to say that you have a tab for instance where it says, okay, those are all the uploaded invoices. However second tab for instance, is only like the already approved ones… so that we can then go into the approved tab and do like a select all or select certain ones whatever. And that way then import them into mip.
Shane W: Got it. So, like if you're able to say filter and say, okay, show me all the approved ones. And then you can view it, double check it and then import it or even if it's already, if they've been approved, just send them to mip.
Sabrina P: Huh.
Shane W: Okay.
Sabrina P: Is that what you're thinking like me, Michelle, or?
Michelle C: Yeah. And so the import file, is it going to be where, so currently we have what's called a micro, it's our inventory system, and that system works similar to where you enter in a po. And then we approve the po and it imports it as an individual transaction into mip, or is it going to be similar to the Brex, import our credit card, where it's like a CD file? And we import that way. And it's one massive file. How, how is that going to look for the invoices?
Shane W: Yeah. So, let's say we're looking at, some invoices here. And I think it would be interesting to kind of get your take on that. Like, how do you, like, if you get an invoice like this, does this, do you guys import this one, one… invoice at a time? Or do you have like 20 invoices from mckesson that you all put together, and load them into one one entry? Like, how does that work?
Michelle C: It's individual?
Shane W: So, individual, so, like that. So, that was my thought is that we would take each individual one that isn't coming from a different system, but that you're you guys need to load you're you would take that and, you know, take the PDF, and import it into Domo, through that interface. And then, it would convert this into, the entry that you could then post into the system. But as I was going through some of the invoices though, it did look like there were some that were like had like 30 or 40 different pages associated with it, that were fairly large and, I j",Consumption Pricing Model,52000.0,Corporate,MYCHN.ORG,2,Non Profit Org,35,$10M to <$25M,Upsell,Blank,2: Determine Needs,Chance Ewell,2025-11-16,2025-08-18,2025-09-30,,,,,,0013800001Jm7h4AAB

I think we should be okay to not have to have a meeting right up front. You guys have given us plenty of detail on that to get things started and we'll definitely report back to you on progress as we're working and kind of let you know where we have questions and when we're ready to show you some things. But yes, should be able to finally get that kicked off this week and get things rolling. So, yeah, awesome. And I don't know if you guys had a chance to look at the agenda I sent over on Friday… let me just pull it up really quick. So first thing we wanted to talk about kind of where those two additional items Tyson that you sent over fit into our roadmap and kind of how we should prioritize those. So we had the skills matrix app that you wanted updates on and then the customer health monitoring system. So if we want to start there, I think that's a good place, sure.
Ted S: So, the bridge matrix was something that Kevin had started and we were just trying to dial it in and finish a couple of things to make it a little more useful. I don't know how big of an ask that is to have some of the different views for the reports. So, I guess depends on how heavy a lift if that's something that we could just do quickly in one of these office… hours, that'd be great. The customer health monitoring was more just me trying to learn how to use Domo. And I thought that was going to be an office hours thing.
Juliana J: Yeah, we can totally do that. I just wanted to, I guess have that conversation about it. So if we wanted to… my guess is Nick is probably going to want to take a look at that skills matrix app and kind of see what you have going on there and obviously, how complicated that will be to change up what the views are, and then maybe we can assess if that's something we need to execute or if you guys want to do it during office hours, is there like and something maybe that will help us determine, is there a timeline that you want to have those updates done? Is there like a date you need to have those by?
Ted S: I was trying to get done by the end of the quarter, but that's kind of more of a nice to have than anything?
Juliana J: Okay. When is the end of quarter for you guys? Are you on a?
Ted S: This, we're on just a calendar year?
Juliana J: Okay. Calendar year. Okay. All right. So end.
Ted S: Of September, I guess, right?
Juliana J: Yeah. Okay. You.
Ted S: Got that in the wrong. You're up one row, I?
Juliana J: Do, yep.
Ted S: That's it?
Juliana J: Thank you. Okay. Okay. So we might need to have maybe some more discovery… on that and is that something you guys could walk us through on today's? Call?
Ted S: On the skills matrix? Yeah, sure.
Juliana J: Okay. Yeah. If we want to, I guess before we flip to that, is this kind of the correct order of priority? I know we had talked about the shop floor alerts kind of fitting in here after we did the manning project, would those take priority over any of these or should this be bumped down maybe underneath of the skills matrix updates probably?
Ted S: If, if the skills matrix updates is a quick not heavy lift, it might be number one just to finish it and get it working? If it's going to derail stuff? Maybe it's number two. So we can finish it. You agree? Yeah. Okay.
Juliana J: Yeah. And part of this I think is kind of assessing the level of effort and then we can place them a little bit better but, okay.
Ted S: Yeah.
Juliana J: Cool. Yeah, maybe we can just walk through that what you have now and kind of what the changes are that you're looking to make.

They also explored strategies for managing data sets and data flows, such as disabling unused components, using timers to keep critical lookup tables active, and leveraging Domo's capabilities like custom apps and dashboards to track and control costs. The team agreed to schedule an earlier meeting next week to make progress on the project.","Benjamin P: good morning.
Greg H: Hey, good morning.
Benjamin P: How are you, Greg?
Greg H: Yeah, doing alright.
Benjamin P: I believe we should have a few more coming. Do you know if Eric? Yeah.
Greg H: I don't know. I know he, I… know he's tasked me with helping him update some budget stuff actually in Domo today. So he might be putting finishing touches on some data sets that I'm going to need to work with, but I've not heard from him otherwise this morning.
Benjamin P: Wonderful. Well, I don't know who all, I don't know if anybody else on our side will be joining. I know Shane is Mountain… Time, so it's a little earlier his time right now. So he may not be here and I'm not sure about onkit but I did want to introduce, will. Will is a new member of our team who's got a tremendous amount of demo experience. Cool. We have brought him in to assist with building out the governance dashboard that we've discussed. And so to kick us off, I'd like to first, just thanks for emailing me back yesterday. On the email. That was again that's just a formality on our side. We have to get approval from you guys to move forward to ensure that we're working toward what was agreed upon. Gotcha. That was all that was so appreciate you reaching out, but I'll give will just a few moments to introduce himself and then we can talk about the requirements for what we'll be building.
William W: Mr. Greg. I'll keep it short and sweet. I'm sure you probably meet a lot of people. So I come from a tech background and a sales background and a power tool background, which is kind of crazy. But I found my way to Domo a few years back and just went all in on it, took college courses, did a whole bunch of stuff. And now I'm on the team and helping find folks like yourself. Cool. Got me up to speed with your account and kind of gave me a heads up on what you guys are looking to accomplish. So I feel like I have a pretty good head for everything. But same with Ben. I mean, I'll be tagging along. So I think he'll be your main point of contact, but of course, I'm here to help. So if Ben's not around and you email, you might hear back from me.
Greg H: All right. Sounds good.
Benjamin P: Cool. Great. So basically… what we're hoping to accomplish here is you guys have roughly 82 data flows. You have 41 dashboards kind of what you use regularly and you guys are… hopefully we'll be moving over to consumption at the end of September. Obviously that's still up in the air, but we hope to provide you with better visibility on how many executions you can expect from your current architecture. And hopefully we can work to, based on the outcome of that dashboard, we can work to help you optimize that architecture.
Greg H: Perfect.
Benjamin P: And our way of doing our way of our approach for optimizing that would be to consolidate data flows where it makes sense to migrate any existing data flows that are powering cards that we will be consolidating, migrating the cards that are being powered from those to the new data sets, obviously paying close attention to the schedule and how things are running to ensure that things aren't running more frequently than they should be. And also to leverage data set views where possible to remove unnecessary executions in your instance. Okay? So, I know we touched on those quite a bit last time but I just wanted to give a run through to make sure both you and will also were that we're all on the same page. I do have, as I said on the previous call, I have a script that I'll be that William and I will be using to capture the lineage. Yeah, I guess.
Greg H: I didn't I'm assuming you had to wait for me to respond, I was looking for it this morning and I was like, oh, maybe they had needed that email response.
Benjamin P: Yeah, unfortunately, we can't move forward until we have that. And so just given that we got that response yesterday, we haven't quite had enough time to put anything together.
Greg H: So.
Benjamin P: This call may be short today, but now that we have that, we can move forward pretty quickly and I expect that it shouldn't take us very long to have something to show in terms of visually for how much each of those data flows work off. And so as we're working on that just before we begin executing this week. And next week, is there anything you want us to be mindful of?
Greg H: No, like I said, everything in my mind is fair game to either reduce consumption or potentially just get rid of altogether if there's something that's just not working well. I think fortunately for ours, I think everything works, the question, is it being used? Like if we've got stuff that's like hasn't been touched and six to nine months, I'd want to present that and be like, let's just lose this whole set of cards like no one's touching them. And then we can lose these five data sets like which are running every few hours, right? Yeah.
Benjamin P: Exactly.
Greg H: From my perspective, everything is fair game… you know, maybe people on the operations side feel different. But from my perspective, if you're not using it well, what are we doing it for? Like, no, that brings up an interesting question. Does Domo, I've worked with some other companies reporting systems that have like, you can export whole infrastructures like the data set, the data flow, and any powered cards and like group them and be like these all import export as a group. And so you can essentially take it out and be like, yeah, we're shelving this. No one's ever using it. But if someone says, oh, I need it back, you're like, okay, let me just re, import this like package and it'll come back.
Benjamin P: Yeah. So as far as data sets go, the data set, it's either they're there or they're not.
Greg H: Right. Well, data set, I can understand. Yeah, but.
Benjamin P: For data flow, it is, we can disable data flows to keep them from running. And so they won't cost you any executions if they're being, if they're disabled. And if any point in time you want to re, enable those and start running them again, you have the option to do that. So we'll err on the side of disabling data flows instead of deleting them if that's what you prefe",Consumption Pricing Model,70223.8,Corporate,KOLMAC.COM,3,Healthcare & Health Services,138,$10M to <$25M,Upsell,Blank,Closed Won,Justin Labrum,2025-08-12,2025-06-26,2025-08-12,2025-08-12,2025-08-12,2025-08-12,2025-08-12,2025-08-07,0015w00002Tn9enAAB

Jason J: Excited isn't exactly the word. I mean, it's just okay. Does it provide our offense enough of a little difference to overcome some of the other issues the offense is having? Because it's not all the quarterback. So, oh, yeah, no, I got playoff baseball today, man. Yeah, not even thinking about it.
Phil S: Yep. Are you going to the game or is it?
Jason J: No, I.
Phil S: Don't know why I was thinking, yeah, sorry, brain's dead. No.

Jason J: mean, it wasn't a negative. It was just a, you know, we were talking baseball and it was, that was kind of.
Michael D: A, we squeezed in. We weren't even supposed to be there.
Jason J: Well, I know that feeling… 15 and a half games back. I don't even know if that's squeezing. Yeah, yeah.
Michael D: We had some help from the mets.
Jason J: Yeah. Well, they collapsed too, which was kind of funny except it's like the only thing I keep saying about the mets is, can we have lindor back please? It's like, hey, could you imagine like, hey, one more person being able to hit on the Cleveland's team? I mean, that would be nice.
Michael D: Yeah. All right. I know. I think Zach is out, right? Hold.
Jason J: On nope.
Michael D: Okay. There.
Phil S: He is.
Michael D: There he is. I'm getting my preferred support reps mixed up. Let's see.
Jason J: We're getting a pretty good beard club here. Mine always stays like in between here and it goes on. I mean, pandemic, I tried it. I like, I let it grow out pandemic, kind of like everybody else did. And it was, I mean, it was different. Yeah.
Michael D: All right. So, Jason… I don't know if you saw the email about the September release webinar that's happening at the end of this meeting. I sent the link to register if you can make it.
Jason J: I can't I have to run out to go to a doctor's appointment immediately after, so.
Michael D: That's fine. I would still go ahead and use that registration link. That way you get the replay afterwards.
Jason J: Okay.
Michael D: It's always good just still to register even if you can't make it live. Yeah, but I know the product managers are doing a live demonstration of walking through some of those enhancements as well as beta features that were included as well as part of September release. So that'd be a good one to join.
Jason J: Okay.
Michael D: I included Jason. I also included Bryce on that as well… so that'll be good. I'll follow up with them and see if they're able to do it. And then the other thing I wanted to mention, it's coming close to that time where I would send Katie her auto renewal email just letting them know that auto renewal is happening for the contract. There isn't anything that she needs to do. It's. Automatic. It's called auto renewal for a reason. But I did want to send that communication. This way. She has it heads up in terms of timing. Yeah. Any concerns or issues with that before I send that out?
Jason J: No, just send it, let her know. I mean, to me, it's more like the same type of thing. Let it get on her radar.
Michael D: Right, exactly. And then Phil, I'll need to do the same then, for the product engineering team as well since they're on auto renewal. So I'll be sending that email out to both Katie and then to Bryce and his team.
Phil S: Yeah. And I had sent a note to Katie and Dan just because ideally we'd like to get you guys on a multi year to provide you just more, you know, stability on that piece, but I don't know Jason, have you heard anything about the renewal? No?
Jason J: I mean, we haven't talked directly about it. I mean, I know Dan's still trying to fight in the battle of kind of getting it spend on it itself too. So it's less of a battle each year. Yeah. So, I know he's going working on that, but I don't know where he's at or anything like that.
Michael D: So, Phil, there's separate discussion that's happening on the renewal that I'm not aware of?
Phil S: No, not really. I just reached out to Katie to ask like, hey, can we get some time to sync? But she hasn't responded yet.
Jason J: Because it's always a challenge, I think.
Phil S: It's good.
Jason J: And how we're going to do it. And then it's just, I mean, it's home depot that's just what it comes down to. So, I mean, we'll get there. It's just how do they want to make us jump through different hoops this year?
Michael D: Good to know. Okay.
Jason J: But yeah, we're way too embedded. I don't like, I mean, I don't know, I don't even care how much like our people kick and scream. I don't think they could put up a fight to tell us no at this point in time anyway. So, I'm not really worried about it.
Michael D: Based on how much you invested and how much you're saving right now, it's hard.
Jason J: Oh, yeah, I almost.
Michael D: Made it to 3,000,000. Now. I think we got to two point seven, four today.
Jason J: What is it?
Michael D: Again, that's in like three months, two and a half months. Well, I know home depot can't speak at dumbapalooza, but I'm definitely submitting you for an award just based on how much you're saving. So, hopefully they'll at least recognize you that way. I.
Jason J: mean, I think there will be a time… that… I think with the right thing that, yes, I could get the okay to speak up there. It's just that it's another thing where there's a lot of process to allow it. So it's like that's, never been like something in my head. I know Phil and I have talked about too. It's like it's not a, oh, this will never happen thing. It's more of a okay when everybody's comfortable, and then I can make the case where it's like, okay, this isn't going to harm HD anything like that. I'm not spreading any different type of things. It's just, hey, this is what it is. And then getting the okay from the PR people and stuff like that. Again, it's another thd, thing with a huge like process to try and get through.

So building custom charts that aren't available… in the normal app store, and then there's some other features that we could look at too like deploying custom applications with java or notebooks, jupyter, notebooks, things like that, but I think this one is for custom graphs.

Mackenzie E: I think we're good.
Ankit S: All righty. Well, I know it's been a couple of weeks since we met. We got to talk about a few things from that meeting, but anything top of mind that we want to start with… any questions or maybe it's best to kind of just jump back into the discovery conversations and talk about how we're going to lay out a roadmap for you guys?
Mackenzie E: We can definitely do that.
Ankit S: We.
Mackenzie E: can definitely do that. Happy to do that. I know that we're definitely interested in some help setting up the adp connector. It's a little bit advanced and some of our tech people are out. We're wondering if that's something maybe your team could help us with while we've got some people out on maternity leave.
Shane W: Yeah, we can help with that. I know that connector is… I've just heard a lot of it's… a harder connector and what people have actually and what people have done is they have the reports sent to like sftp from adp and then, and they pick them up that way too. So I don't know what the best way to do it is. I don't know if they've added. It's been a year or two since I've done it, but there, so there may be, some new pieces of it that I'm not aware of, but yeah, I for sure can help with that. One way or the other. We can get data in.
Mackenzie E: That would be awesome. And I know we're super interested in custom graphs, custom visualizations.
Shane W: Yeah. Tell me about that. What you're when you say custom visualization. What, what are you envisioning?
Mackenzie E: You want to take it, Teddy or I'm happy to too. It's up to you.
Theodore F: If you have an idea already, I, I'm kind of just curious about what the process would be in general. I don't necessarily have like an end goal at the moment.
Mackenzie E: Yeah, I think likewise. But I'd love to build a custom normal distribution chart.
Shane W: Okay. And we… don't have, any, anything that's that shows that.
Mackenzie E: I can see histograms which are similar, not the same but similar. So we've kind of just been defaulting to those, and using them for the use case. But yeah, like Teddy, I'm interested to know what the process would be if we tried to do something different or yeah, decided to deploy a custom chart.
Shane W: Yeah. Okay. Let me talk about that. I mean we didn't even discuss that we have time today, but so it sounds like the adp connector custom… graphs. What else? Anything else that's kind of top of mind?
Mackenzie E: I would like maybe a rundown on deploying custom applications inside of Domo? We did one for like a custom button build, but we have an application that we just run locally that taps the Pardot Salesforce API that we would be interested in deploying in Domo if we can.
Shane W: Okay. Perfect. All right. So it sounds like a lot of kind of just education, I guess around how… to do some of this more advanced programming inside of Domo?
Mackenzie E: I think that would be super helpful. Teddy. Anything from your side, I might have missed.
Theodore F: Oh, no, I think that, I think that covers it all just trying to learn more about the platform, what you can do?
Shane W: Yeah, awesome. And are you guys? Are you guys have any like new use cases, or things like that you're working on, or groups within the organization, that you're trying to support with Domo?
Mackenzie E: I don't think the use cases are terribly different, but it's definitely getting more widely disseminated throughout the organization as people kind of discover use cases, bring their use cases to us, but I think the core demographics of people inside of Domo is relatively the same.
Shane W: Great.
Theodore F: Yeah. I mean, for some background, we've been pretty what's the word like siloed with the Domo use in general and we're right now trying to proliferate it a little bit more across the company and give people an idea of what we can do with it. Yeah. So we anticipate there will be more use cases in the next few months, but up until now, it's been, pretty limited to like reporting.
Shane W: Remind me what was the, what's the silo that you guys are in?
Theodore F: Well, we're the research team. Yeah. And there's I mean, we've got like an advisory team, we got some specialized teams for like investor day, yeah, conduct investor days. We, of course, have all of our operations teams like business development ops itself, but for the most part just been centralized, in research. So we're just trying to, yes, go ahead. No. I was just gonna say we're just trying to disperse it a little bit more across the company and get people to sort of feed us their ideas and see what we can do with it. So.
Shane W: Yeah.
Sneha C: We've definitely created a few dashboards for teams across the board to kind of just try to show them what we can do, you know, sales, marketing, HR, with adp.

How are you guys doing, Brian, Ashley… doing well. We'll just give our team a couple of minutes to jump on.
Juliana J: Everyone. Hi… happy Monday. Nick. I just jumped on right when you were talking where you mentioning we'll give Brian a couple more minutes here.
Nik K: Yeah. Well, I mean, it… kind of depends on the agenda as well, right? We're going to cover a lot of the data items in today's, office hours so we can jump right into those. But if there were any other viz questions we wanted to start with, we can pin those for Brian when he joins.
Juliana J: Yeah, I think let's pin them. I think the biggest priority today was going through data architecture. Ashli. I know you sent over some awesome questions, things to go over there. So I think that's a good starting point. And then if we have time at the end, we can go through some of those business goals and kind of refine that slide on the roadmap if that makes sense to everybody here. Yeah, that sounds good. And then I know we have some new faces on each side. We have Mackenzie and then we also have will on the Domo side too, so we can do some quick introductions there… really quick. I don't know will, if you want to start.
William W: Well, I'm with Domo, I'm going to be a technical consultant helping out with the different projects that we land with vcu, huge fan of credit unions, haven't, used beacon before, but maybe I need to check it out for my next adventure. So, very happy to be here. Very nice to meet everyone.
Juliana J: Thank you. Yeah, will be partnering with Nick on the technical side. And then he'll also be helping build out the self service list generation use case that we have. So you'll definitely see will on most of our future calls here. Yeah. And then I know we have Mackenzie who we heard is joining the team. So we're looking forward to working with you Mackenzie. I don't know if you wanted to do a quick introduction?
Mackenzie C: Yeah, literally, Mackenzie, I'm currently our it project manager here, but I am transitioning to business intelligence. So, super excited. And every time I see Domo more stuff of it, I just get more ready to start. So I'm sure after this, I'll be like let's go. Thank you guys for having me. Yeah.
Juliana J: We're excited to work with you. And yeah, feel free to ask any questions you have as we're going through these are office hour meetings. So it's really meant for answering questions and helping further your understanding of Domo and making sure we're doing things efficiently in the best way possible. So with that, I guess I will hand it over to Nick to start going over data architecture.
Nik K: All right. Sorry, lost my mouse there for a second. Okay. So do we want to jump right into you? Had a lot of workbench questions? Ashli, do we want to jump in there?
Ashli M: Yeah, I mean, I guess I was just trying to think of some things off the top of my head that were things I didn't know that maybe would get us started. So, yeah, I think that would be a good place to start for me.
Nik K: Okay. Yeah. Some important structural questions there. So we.
Ashli M: actually, I just looked at the email. We did move away from the local file provider. Oh, okay. So we did end up going ahead and setting up the sftp. So I did actually keep that part connected. Okay?
Nik K: That's good. Yeah, sftp is good about wildcards. So.
Ashli M: Yes.
Nik K: Okay. So, so.
Ashli M: Maybe that part is probably, I think.
Nik K: Yeah. So we can skip question one. Yes. And for your other workbench sources, are they coming from like a SQL server? What's the source system that we're connecting to?
Ashli M: I'm not our core system is DNA and it's an oracle server. There's a connection that was, these were pre built connections before my time. So the other one is to a database for our phone system, that's here locally. And then we will also be adding another database connection for a local database for our GL system. But the other pieces are primarily requiring us to do the file import process because those vendors don't really allow. They don't have. Well, some of them do have an sftp that we're passing it through our btec our it area and they're going to drop the files that we'll bring in. But then there are some manually downloaded files that we'll put through that sftp process so we can automate that.
Nik K: Okay. Yeah. And we can touch a little bit on some of those other processes later if there's any manual pieces that we can help automate because workbench can kick off a script as well, right? And go fetch things for you. But yeah, we can come back to those. So with DNA, you mentioned oracle database. So you're still doing SQL queries against that with like an odbc driver. And in the past.
Ashli M: Yeah, I think those all come in. You'll see those data sources on odbc connection?
Nik K: Okay, perfect. So let's… yeah, odbc should work and then we have the options of append and upstart. I think that's one of the key questions that we can start with just your WH account common, right? Yeah. So that table you mentioned 80,000,000 rows and only like the previous day will update. So is it always just the previous day's records that update? Or you could have some entries in the past which have also changed?
Ashli M: I can't say for certain, I do know that there have been times that they've run scripts against historical effective dates. So I don't you know.
Nik K: Okay. And so is there a field in the data set that tells you like last modified on each row?
Ashli M: I don't believe on each row, no, there's just basically the, for this one is the effective date of the row information, but it doesn't there's a date last maintenance, but I'm not sure if that indicates the just the account record or if it's really specific to the row in that object?
Nik K: I see and effective date, would that be an indication of when that row might've been added and we should.
Ashli M: We can, yes. So typically, what's so there's a couple of things that I can ask about here. So each time our system updates of an evening, you know, it's warehousing the table and it's creating an effective date row for tha",Consumption Pricing Model,122200.0,Corporate,BEACONCU.ORG,2,Financial Services,193,$25M to <$50M,Renewal,Blank,2: Determine Needs,Kate Kranz,2026-04-30,2023-04-25,2023-04-25,,,,,,0015w00002hvarUAAQ

They also discussed the ease of sharing content between the different app studio apps, and Benjamin provided an update on his progress with the Kepler project, mentioning that he would be out of the office on Friday and Monday.","Benjamin P: hey, Bellamy.
Bellamy Y: Hey, Ben.
Benjamin P: How are you?
Bellamy Y: Good… good. Hey, Ben. Just want to confirm, but creating… custom API on jupyter is possible between Salesforce and careport, right? The XML thing.
Benjamin P: Yes, I believe. So, we obviously need to, I need to have some more information about careport… and how the XML file is coming in. So, assuming that we can get the data, I feel like I do feel like we can write a script and automate it to pull that data through and write it into Salesforce. So obviously, I can't say that with 100 percent certainty until I know the source of where we're going to be getting that XML file from. And, but assuming we can get the data then, yes, we should be able to do that.
Bellamy Y: Okay, great. I'll make sure these guys are not calling back. I'm about to get pissed. I called them twice already.
Benjamin P: Well… did you see my email earlier today?
Bellamy Y: Yes, I took a look at the thing. It looks great.
Benjamin P: Okay. So, cool. So I don't know how much time you're able to spend with it if you were able to validate the metrics, if they looked like they were consistent… with what you were seeing or not. But if you do have some time to do that, it doesn't have to be right now, then that would be great. Over the next couple days. I did finally get past the major issue that I was having with the Kepler app and being able to develop locally. I was on for about an hour with one of our software developers and he finally helped me to get past the issue. And so I'm finally unblocked on that. It is successfully pulling in the latitude and longitudinal data from the demo dataset. And so now I am working on plotting that on the map. So I had to get past that before I was able to make any more progress. And I'm finally past that now. And so I'll provide you with an update as I actually start to build out something that looks helpful with the addresses that we have. So we have 79,000 addresses. I feel like I should be able to build out something here. I'm hoping today, like I'm going to be working on it for the next 30 45 minutes after we get off this call. And so I think I should have something to show today by the end of the day today. Hopefully. So I'll provide you with an update on that as soon as I have it, but that's what I have for today.
Bellamy Y: Okay. Thank you so much. I think as… a next step, once everything is figured out and we have those cards, I think it would be kind of organizing them into a dashboard or studio app because right now I see all these GA in the studio app, but it's just a GA. So I think we might want to build more on top of this. Now question is like initially, I thought that I'm going to have one app studio for all the departments.
Benjamin P: Well,
Bellamy Y: but I don't know what the best practice is.
Benjamin P: I'm going to tell you why you may not want to do that. Okay, an app studio, an app studio app is similar to a dashboard in that once you share the app studio app with a user, they have access to every page, just like if you share a dashboard with a user, they have access to every card in the dashboard, it's no different than that. You cannot say that. I only want certain people to have access to this page in the app studio app. And I only want certain people to access this page in the app studio app, it's either every page or no page. Now. I do believe they're working on building in some functionality to allow you to have more granular control over access within the pages of your apps. But as of where it stands today, if we did create an app studio app with five pages, one for each department, everybody would have access to every department. And I don't know if that's what you want. Now, if you do want to separate access between the different departments, which I would think you probably would, then you would need to have one app studio app for each department.
Bellamy Y: Okay.
Benjamin P: Or we can just do a dashboard. I think app studio is probably the better way to go. But we could also do dashboards if you wanted to.
Bellamy Y: Yeah.
Benjamin P: I would encourage app studio.
Bellamy Y: I think so. I think let's split them up and then by departments, and then we'll just have another app studio for executive stuff because I'm thinking about as an audience like executive audience, I was thinking that they would want to have access to everything all at once. So, I guess we're probably going to just build both versions… or maybe not. Is there a way around that?
Benjamin P: Around what?
Bellamy Y: So, like as an executive, right? On the C suite, I would assume that the C suite would want to be able to have access of every department's, dashboards all at once. So everything being in one app studio.
Benjamin P: Yeah. I mean, you could create five app studio apps, one for each department and then create one for executives that consolidates everything together. You could do that if you wanted to, if you wanted the executives to not have to leave and go from one app to the other.
Bellamy Y: Yeah. I think that's probably what I'm going to have to do but is it easy to like copy and paste… what you've done on other?
Benjamin P: I know you can import pages. You can import dashboards to app studio. So I would think that you should be able to import pages from other apps. Let me see. So I'm going to go into and I know you can't see my screen. I'm just testing something real quick import app pages. Yes, you can. Okay. Yes, you can, great. Let's see what we would do is let's just assume that this, let's assume for a moment that this is the executive dashboard, and then this talent acquisition here, we have all of the Google KPIs, right? So if this was the executive one, we could go into pages… and then import app pages from talent acquisition and then next, and then just, we would just select just that page and then import and then it would create the page.
Bellamy Y: Oh, good. Okay. Awesome. So then it's great. That's easy.
Benjamin P: Yep. So we can do that.
Bellamy Y: Okay. Yeah. Let's totally go for that. I loved Domo so much it's crazy.

Phil S: Just to have people come outside.
Todd B: Yeah. I'm used to the like the heat lamp thing, you know, but having the misters is a whole different problem.

Phil S: Yes, thank you for waiting for us. That's the, so, what I figured agenda wise, and we've got matt here too is first of all, just so you were able to log in. You've already got like credentials, password, everything like that. Okay. Yeah. And then I think really, what would probably be good to start is to get on the same page. I know from my notes we wanted to pick, I think you'd mentioned like paint, you know, could be a really good category. Yeah, I'm.
Todd B: on paint right now. So, like that's like the category that I'm like training, okay?
Phil S: And how does that work? Like? Because I think you'd mentioned that you would still or you're still kind of pending of which one you'd officially take over? Or do they have you like handling paint as you're training? And then you take on more as you get more ramped up or how does that work? Yeah?
Todd B: So, I'm in the paint department broadly, which is it's a big department that has a bunch of different jobs and classes and things of that nature. Okay? So right now, I'm working on projects… like little projects that come up and I could end up working on some aspect of paint.
Matthew N: Okay. Or I could.
Todd B: End up working on toilets. You just never really know what your category is. Yeah, will be until you're actually placed. But the idea is that I'll end up in paint. It's just not a guarantee.
Phil S: Yeah. But it, and I mean the use cases will pretty much be the same. I would imagine, right? You're going to want to compile same data. Some things are going to be maybe more relevant to certain, you know, categories than others. But, okay. And then one new name, you'll see another face here. I've got Ben Parker on the line here with us as well. Ben's in the Georgia area as well. And Ben is assigned to the home depot account as what we call like a technical adoption manager. Really what that means? Ben is from our consulting services team. So we'll actually, you know, build out use cases. And really with home depot, he's working closely right now with Jason and salvage, and also with a product engineering team of like doing those builds. But you know, also for opportunities like this, we want to keep Ben in the loop because once this turns into, okay, a real use case, we're all in the loop. It's not like we're ramping up a whole separate team, you know, to go deliver it. But Ben, I'll let you say hi as well.
Benjamin P: Yeah. Like Phil said, I've been working closely with several home depot departments and I'm a technical consultant here at demo. I've been here for going on two years. I was a customer for seven years before coming over. I've worked in many parts of the platform, building out technical solutions both with out of the box chemicals as well as building custom solutions, which is what we're aiming towards with the product engineering group is a little bit more of a broad solution involving some testing components. So I look forward to hearing about how we maybe can help you.
Todd B: Yeah. And you're working with Jason as well?
Benjamin P: Yep.
Todd B: Okay. So I set up some time with him to go over what he's working on and learn from him a little bit.
Phil S: Awesome. Yeah, exciting times with him. He just, he just uncovered a 1,000,000 dollar a month problem that he was able to solve inside of Domo. So it's exciting. Yeah, he'll have some cool stuff to show you of just like, yeah, I'll let him.
Todd B: I hope he got a raise. I hope he got a raise out of it.
Phil S: You know, it's kind of funny. You mentioned that he's I keep telling his boss too, I'm like guys like in any way kind of separate topic, but yes, he should get a raise like he's doing, I'm in sales and I literally am not bringing that much money to Domo right? That's like my whole job.
Todd B: I mean, that's a lot of value.
Phil S: Yeah, exactly. But yeah. So really what I was thinking so I understand like we want paint and I think we could on our side probably assume like what you might want to do inside of Domo. But let's maybe first just start with like what data we want to help you get into your trial instance. Is it just like bringing in those pivot tables like some of that excel data or where all would we want to grab data to build out? Like the proof of concept?
Todd B: Yeah. It could be from the pivot tables, I'm kind of interested in learning how to pull in data from the… background or whatever you call it, you know, like from the actual like data tables from bigquery.

So, we were in communications with Ivan previously and he let us know that we had like 20 or so hours to utilize with you guys kind of troubleshoot and build things out and we wanted to save that for some things we really got stuck on. And we run into one of those things. So I'm like instead of reading a bunch of knowledge based articles, I'm like we could just meet with you guys and kind of scale what we're wanting to build out. So what we've done is we've built out an AI agent that combs through all of our product reviews and we built out a workflow that summarizes depending on the product, right? So selecting a certain product, it'll tell us like the top five quality product features that are negative, just kind of to notice trends of like, hey, a lot of people are mentioning the screws for this unit or mentioning, you know, rust on this other unit. And so, I think we built that out just fine. I followed a video, an academy video, I think I sent to onkit that Domo provided. But now we're just having a problem of connecting that workflow into an app or to a dashboard to like as a trigger. So that way our team can kind of utilize that workflow. If that makes sense?
Ankit S: Yeah.
Jenna H: This sounds like a Alex or a Scott type of question? That is, I don't think you want me to try to attempt any of that myself?
Alex D: So, ironically, that is a use case I haven't ran into just yet. So, is the end goal to run the workflow when a user interacts with like an app or something. Is that what you're trying to do?
Jackson B: Yeah. So originally, I want it to be a form because it's just as triggered through a form. And if it helps me to share my screen, I can too.
Alex D: Absolutely.
Jackson B: Okay. Let me do that. Can you guys see that? All right?
Ankit S: Yep.
Jackson B: Okay. So, I have this workflow. And when I followed the video, you just start out with creating this form, right? I won't preview it now, but it's a form I built in the workflow. And this all works just fine. Like when I test it out, no problems at all. Works, just how we want to, the problem is in the video, they connected it to an app, and that's how they were able to like utilize this form to trigger the workflow. But when I go into the workflow to add a form, I'll… just do it right here.
Scott T: Hang on real quick. Hang on, don't, use that form. So hit close on that.
Jackson B: Okay. Use the workflow, and.
Scott T: Qlik on the workflow. Yeah, the workflow. Yep.
Jackson B: So, when I drag that in here, this is the agent. Nothing happens when I do it that way, like it just stays here, add content. I could try inserting a form here where I can insert a workflow. But it's just kind of this loop of nothing populating.
Scott T: Okay. Is the workflow? Have you, have you, can you go back to your workflow really quickly? Has it been like deployed?
Jackson B: Yeah, this is deployed and live. And I'll be the first to say, I do not know this stuff at all that's why I'm YouTube, universiting it right now, you know, just.
Scott T: Yeah. I mean, the other… I feel like we might be able to do it with a button too. Go back to your app.
Jenna H: Yeah.
Scott T: I've seen it. It's triggered by the button and, drag the button thing over… and then action on that button. Yeah, go to actions, Qlik on, disable actions and do initiate workflow.
Jackson B: Oh,
Scott T: and then with form inputs, yeah. Okay. So now, let's hit save… and then if you Qlik that label button, you can change what label says.
Jackson B: Ah, this, does it. Okay. That should work then.

They also explored the potential benefits of the enterprise caps feature, which Keske decided not to implement immediately but requested more information on for future consideration. The conversation also touched on the progress of the POC and dashboard projects, with Keske confirming the mobile project has been delayed.","Signe P: hi, keske.
Keske T: Hi Signe. How are you doing?
Signe P: Good. How are you? Good, ready for the weekend right after this? Let's go get a drink.
Keske T: Definitely thought I don't drink, but that's okay.
Signe P: Oh, okay. Let's go get a hot chocolate.
Keske T: Yeah. So, I guess… I did not realize my fault for not knowing the details of the contract. But so any overages automatically become recurring.
Signe P: That is correct. And apologies for not bringing that up earlier. Again, my assumption was that we were talking about standard credits this whole time. So when you said one time credits, it threw me off a little bit because we haven't had that request before. So we went back internally and we realized wait a minute, their contract even says any overages would turn into standard and any credits purchased would turn into standard for the remainder of the contract.
Keske T: Okay. That's my fault for not knowing that… because again, the problem is we don't know what our normal consumption is going to be. Hence, I didn't want to commit to some number we're thinking well, that's going to be for the rest of the contract, but I don't know what it's going to be. I mean, so there was one particular thing that drove the usage up as my understanding from Aki and she's working to get that off of Domo so it can refresh and live somewhere else and consume compute in our Aws. So she wasn't anticipating needing more than what we had already currently signed up for.
Signe P: Well, the thing with that though is you've already maxed that out. So you would have to get rid of any additional and what you've already consumed because, you have 40,000 credits to work with period. And so I think what we're trying to talk through is it's showing a projection of about 40,000 credits additional that you will need by January. We understand that there's always going to be room for improvement and efficiencies but there's also hopefully room for growth. We know that you have some use cases that you're currently working on. And with that hopefully additional use cases that you're working on. And so what I tried to do is say I don't want you to pay a one time fee of 38 K. They might drop off. That's true, but you've already put the funds towards it. I'd rather you have that and then you can reuse those credits as you need. So if there are other projects or things that come up, you've already paid for them. What I don't want. And what I've been trying to prevent is a bunch of overage fees. That was my push for last month is because they're expensive and they don't go anywhere. So you have an overage for August, which means starting September first year, if you paid that overage, then you're at zero again. So any credits you're accruing for September is already an overage.
Keske T: And just to confirm the overages will come back and be added to next year's.
Signe P: yeah. So now that we've clarified that, and again, I apologize for not clarifying that, but yes, they do add to your contract. So just to give you an example, like right now for August, you had 5,727 credits of overage. So that's at a dollar 25 that's 7,000 dollars, just over 7,000 dollars in overage. That does, now you have another 7,000 dollar charge that's going to turn that into standard for the remainder of the contract. So you pay for what you've already used, and then they add that to your contract.
Keske T: Right, right, right.
Signe P: So that's about 14,000 dollars already that you'd be paying.
Keske T: Yeah. So I think in light of that, then I think the option, I think it was the option two. So you spend the 50… sorry in option two. Again, that dropped it down to a dollar.
Signe P: Yeah. So once you hit the 100 K mark, then it's tiered. So it's a dollar 25. At the 100 K mark, it's a dollar per credit. So then you'd get 50,000 credits instead of 38,000 credits or whatever that overage would be. And so then you'd have 100,000. Well, actually, no, that's if we extended the agreement, but that means you'd have 90,000 credits to work with for the remainder of your contract.
Keske T: 90,000. Wait. Sorry, you said remainder of the well. So if we didn't extend the contract, it's January 20 26 through January 20 27, right?
Signe P: Yep. So our option two, that's the latest agreement that I sent over to you that's what it would look like. So, you have the prorated amount from here until January, which is, I think it was like 20 something K. And then from January till 20 27, January, then you'd have the total amount of credits that you have for your contract would be 90,000 credits. That's your original agreement of the 40,000 plus the additional 50,000 put together.
Keske T: Sorry, I'm trying to bring this up here. So… it would look like pulling up. So the 27 nine gets us through the end of this year.
Signe P: And then,
Keske T: wouldn't yeah. Hang on. Let me just share, sorry, share button.
Signe P: I know, right?
Keske T: Okay. Sorry, I just want to make sure I, okay. So this 27 nine, call it 28. This gets us through the end of this contract period.
Signe P: Until January 20 26.
Keske T: Right. Yeah. Well, sorry, when I say end of this contract period, I mean, end of, well… it's a three year, it was a three year agreement, so.
Signe P: I don't know what? Yeah, if you look at the there's dates right above it. So subscription service. So that prorated amount is from September first until January thirtieth 20 26. Do you see where it's at? Okay?
Keske T: And then this next one. So I would, I was anticipating or I have anticipated. So for the contract period here… 20 26 through basically the calendar year 20 26.
Signe P: Huh.
Keske T: Was our standard base of 50, but then don't, we, so.
Signe P: This is separate from your original agreement.
Keske T: Okay.
Signe P: Yeah. So this is an addition. So what it's gonna look like is you have the stub period and then this is an addition. So this is a separate contract. This is just an addition, an amendment basically. And so what it's gonna look like and if it, if it's better for you visually to have it all in one contract so that you can see the total amount going forward, we ca",Consumption Pricing Model,117080.15624999999,Corporate,LONGROADENERGY.COM,2,Engineering & Construction,189,$100M to <$250M,Upsell,Blank,Duplicate,Signe Pastran,2025-09-18,2025-09-02,2025-09-18,2025-09-02,2025-09-02,2025-09-02,2025-09-18,,0015w000025IoiXAAS

John P: Sweet.
Jenna H: Awesome. Alright. So, let me, I think Ankit said he'll be joining halfway through this call. He was double booked for the first half. So, today, we're… really going to talk about visualization and, you know, kind of best practices around all of that… John. Have you done any… trainings or any type of playing around… in the instance or anything since we talked last?
John P: A little bit. I mean, just as far as like adding basic things to cards, adding columns things like that, but not really much as far as like design or anything like that. So.
Jenna H: Awesome. How are you feeling about being in like the demo instance?
John P: Oh, I'm getting there. It's a bit. I come from Power BI, so it's quite a bit different in a lot of ways but it's I'm getting there. So.
Jenna H: And I know that Maddie your CSM, we're getting those Domo immersion coupon codes for you and for Jordan as well, which I think is going to be awesome. And did I send over… training? Did I send over like Domo one on one new user training?
John P: I don't think so.
Jenna H: Kind of remember all of the resources that we've got and if I've sent them out, so, let me, have you moved yet… or were you moving?
John P: No, no, I live in salt lake already.
Jenna H: Ah, perfect. I wasn't sure if you were moving with the new position… okay.
Scott T: Yeah. One of the new analysts, maybe it wasn't with packsize though.
Jenna H: Maybe it was moving… okay, let me. All right. So, we have the training… and then I sent the roadmap. Because, you know, we crap well, let me pull up… some supplemental training as well that I think if you have time and things is always kind of beneficial to do. Okay. Have you been in the Domo central area at all?
John P: No, just in Domo university?
Jenna H: Okay. So one of my favorite things about Domo, is the amount of information that they make accessible for you to kind of train yourself, expand upon knowledge and things like that. And so if we go, so… if you're in your instance, if you Qlik on the little question mark, it's gonna pop up Domo central. And so you're familiar with Domo university. Yeah… I also find a lot of benefit in the help section. So there's this whole getting started piece here. And then there's this whole knowledge based article here or knowledge based section here, release notes especially as you get more and more familiar with the platform. This is gonna help keep you up to date on what new products and features are available. But the how to articles in the videos are where I I'll reference them a lot when I send out things to you. So what I love about the videos is for the most part, they're like five minutes. So they're like little nugget sized pieces of information here and they have them all grouped into the section. So I have like a list of like favorites especially in terms of visualizations that I'll send over to you. But it kind of talks like this one's great about a dashboard strategy overview. And then there can be different pieces. Some of them are a little outdated… like we don't see a ton of sumo pivot tables happening. So I wouldn't like recommend going through and watching all of the videos, but I do have my like I said, my list of favorites and I'll send those over and kind of talking about hey, like these are some really cool short informational videos that I think would benefit watching. So we have those for this. And then there should be some for app studio as well. Did they put that under Domo products? So I don't the organization's not necessarily always intuitive here but this is a great resource though. And then another piece with the help section is the how to articles and the knowledge base. And this is where you will get so much resources. So today we're going to really focus on visualizing data in Domo. So if you like clicked on this, it's all these subcategories here. And, you know, like a lot of times chart types. And now here's all the different charts that we have and you'll find sometimes there's things like these best practices here that kind of details like, hey, this type of chart works best for these type of KPIs, but then if you were saying like you really want to get into like a specific bar chart, you could go here and it walks you through all the different types of bar charts that we have. And then you can even go and get further in detail and it breaks it all down with all the different properties, how the data is structured to support the different types of charts, especially because some chart types aren't as intuitive as you would expect them to be. Which was a little bit of a plot twist. So I'll send over some of those as well for you. Cool. But yeah, lots of really great resources here. Another component is.
Scott T: I will say every chart type in Domo seems to have its own set of chart properties. So I always recommend especially if you're playing with a new chart type, like really explore all of the chart properties in the analyzer because you'll find some surprising things in there that might make a big difference in how the visual comes across.
Jenna H: It's very true. And sometimes like they don't one table chart type may not translate super well to like a pivot table for a reason in terms of like the formatting and they may not have a setting available in one but it's available in the other. So when you're making decisions, sometimes you'll start to learn which chart type has those features and functionalities that you need. Like some people like to have a goal line or a target line in their charts, but that's only available to enter as like a static goal line in certain charts. Not all bar charts have it. So you'll be coming here a lot.
John P: Probably, yeah. Okay. Cool. That's awesome though.

Dylan J: Me, I just ate lunch. I'll just be helping kind of keep things moving forward although it sounds like Brian and Stuart already have this thing moving along, really nicely for you. So here to assist where I can.
Virginia C: Excellent.
Stuart R: Okay. So I'm just joining, I think kind of in the beginning, I just want to make sure that you have everything you need. You're meeting with your CMO soon. So, yeah.
Virginia C: I've got the quote. I've got Brian and engineers working on things. I'm trying to work on some things, trying to get something put in place and sort of cast the vision for my team and hinge that on reporting and how we are strategic partners to the marketing organization, not just in maintaining, you know, sort of that business as usual, maintenance of the digital properties. But then coming back to the business and saying here's what we're seeing from those properties and making data driven decisions. And the backbone of that would be a tool like Domo, not even, like Domo to then position our team as that strategic partner in the organization. So that's kind of my super high level pitch version of what I intend to put in front of them without any of the visuals, so.
Stuart R: But I mean, you will be showing like some of the stuff that's being built today, right? Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Did you get feedback on everyone's social connector?
Virginia C: Feedback?
Stuart R: Did you chat? I think I'd heard from Brian that you were chatting with Chris or someone?
Brian F: Well, we've been trying to get, we have been able to download some of the data and we've been working with a, somebody that's Dan, is it Dan in support over there? And the bottom line looks like is they just have not built out the API… like it's very basic. We were able to get some stuff. I did send a question. I didn't see if he responded. We are able to pull down some data. It just doesn't look like it's very robust is where we are right now. So, we're going to try to do the best we can with what we got. And it's not that it's behind a paywall again, according to what Dan is saying, it's just, it doesn't exist.
Stuart R: Dan Morris?
Brian F: No, no, no. This is Dan at, oh… you're at, so it's Dan at everyonesocial. What is his last name?
Virginia C: He hasn't shared it. It doesn't look like.
Brian F: Dan, no, it is Dan Morris. How did you know, you knew that Guy?
Stuart R: Yeah, yeah. I used to work with him at another company, but, yeah, he's a good Guy. He's not going to develop your API.
Brian F: Yeah.
Virginia C: Yeah. We asked him for a product roadmap so that we could like triangulate and provide it back to my organization of here's, when we would expect this piece to be able to be integrated into Domo and they don't have it publicly shared. So.
Stuart R: Yeah. I know they're working on a big project over there… that's probably taking most of their time. But, okay. So, there is some data coming in just not as robust as other connections got it.
Virginia C: But then Brian kind of what I want to spend a little bit of time. I saw you added a new tab to the app when I was poking around in that. I do want to spend a little bit of time together. Looking at the sprout social connector. I tried to connect that today and I'm getting some errors… oh.
Brian F: No, I'm shaking my head like, yeah, I'm kind of working through that too. Same thing. Basically, I saw what you did and, yeah, I got in touch with some people to help me and they're like we're working on it, so.
Virginia C: I don't know what that means.
Brian F: So, let's finish with Stuart. Is there anything from Stuart? Virginia? Is there anything you need for your meeting?
Virginia C: I think I've got what I need… and we'll see how it goes. It's like I said, I needed to be able to say here's something usable because to date, we, you know, before Brian, we really haven't had anything in there. So it was… a lost cause to go in and say, I'd like to renew this tool where we're not actually using it. So now we've got something we've… made progress and I can show him the dashboard. I can show him how it ties back to the teams and what they're focused on and paint a picture for iteration, paint a picture for my team's upskilling, and, you know, that's kind of the best I've got at this point.
Stuart R: Okay, cool. Yeah, I just wanted to make, I just wanted to join on top of the hour here and just say, you know, hi if you need anything, let me know. But, yeah, Doug finally got like a version sent over to you that doesn't have a big draft on it, which is good. I think that's the amount of credits you would need based off of kind of, our initial calculations. I think you should be good there. And then we removed the bronze support which I don't think you were getting much value out of anyway. So it's really kind of the we've stripped it down quite a bit. So it's just everything you need, nothing you don't need. And then Brian and team, you guys have been awesome in helping stand up some of this, some of these reports so that she can prove value to CMO. So thank you for that work and thank you Virginia too for partnering. We've gone through a couple of teams. So this is, I know it's not, you know, it's a team effort, but I know, I appreciate the time that you've put into this as well.

Bellamy Y: Great, Ben, should I hop on somehow here after the call with Tiana? Should we try to, what do you think is left in terms of the tasks that needs to happen for us to get to that Ta dashboard? Because I can jump in?
Benjamin P: Yeah. I guess we should probably talk about because I know you'd put together sort of like a wireframe in Microsoft word. And I know that you also said that was sort of like a draft. It was by no means a final product, right? So, I think that given we have, you know, I'm working on the map and I said that I want to have that done by next week and that's still the plan. So given that we'll have the map and that we'll have, we had the labor data and we had the GA, iv data and we had the Monday data having a good understanding of what… we're wanting to deliver to the users in terms of KPIs and visuals would be really helpful. So, I don't know if you want to review that Microsoft word document and sort of try to finalize it with how you expect things to look… I think that would be helpful that way when it's time to start building, we'll have something to go off of that would be, I think that would be the best use of time. What do you think? Yeah.
Bellamy Y: I think so too. I think so. After this call with Tiana, I'll try to bake it into my day to go through all the data sets and get familiarized with what kind of data exists in there. And I'll cross reference with the Google doc and try to understand where and how we're going to make each of the metrics. I might even go in and build the etls myself.
Benjamin P: Okay. Well, yeah, if you want to get started on that, and then, you know, if you do get started on the etls and if you have any questions then obviously, you can reach out and I can jump in and help where needed. But yeah, I mean, the more hands that we have working on it, the faster we can move. So, yeah, that would be really helpful.
Bellamy Y: Okay, perfect. Yeah. Let me do that then. So after Tiana, I'll take a look and everything, and then by Friday, I might have some updates for you.
Benjamin P: Then. Sounds good?
Bellamy Y: Yeah. Otherwise the map, I'm both me and the CEOS looking very much forward to it because I've already primed them up a little bit. So getting on that next week would be great.
Benjamin P: Wonderful. Yeah. Sounds good. Well, yeah, I don't know if you've got anything else, but I know we have our meeting this afternoon, so.
Bellamy Y: Yeah, we can do it. We can talk later Ben.
Benjamin P: Okay. Yeah. Sounds good. Thank you, Ben. Appreciate it. Bellamy. Alrighty.

Good morning, everybody, David, Lucy, Colette. Morning. How's everybody today? What is today Tuesday? So far? So good. Yeah, it's already Tuesday. That's good news… Colette. How are you this week?
Colette M: Thursday would have been better news?
Kyle C: Yeah, I agree.
Casey D: True, true. Any word on the fit for use assessment for the AI use case with Ravi and team yet?
Colette M: I haven't heard back from anyone about that. I know we needed to submit some paperwork. I think Ravi was handling that. So let me follow up with him and see what's going on.
Casey D: Okay. Sounds good. Thank you. No problem. And we might have some more coming your way in terms of use cases. So I assume we'll just kind of do the same thing with alerting you and Noman, to kick off the assessment or provide whatever questions you need answered. And hopefully the majority are the same. Do you know if like… the security, the AI go ahead?
Colette M: It should be the same. The AI assessment. Either way, the main security issue is our data and you kind of already have that. So.
Casey D: Okay. Yeah, that'd be great if it was just continually submitting the same one. Good morning, Martin, Shelley. Kyle?
Shelly V: Good morning.
Casey D: Good morning. All right. Well, we can probably get started as people trickle in. Just a reminder. This is a kind of a split call that we organize. The first half is just general updates, questions, issues, concerns that we can go through from anybody and everyone from gff, symfony, supplier management and all that. And then the second half, we have Braxton and Scott thompson from our technical resources team who can actually do some open office hours for anything technical that you need hands on assistance with. So with that in mind who would like to kick us off? Anybody? Have anything top of mind that they want to ask or anything needed or any issues to point out any struggles, new use cases, projects, anything else going on?
Shelly V: We're a quiet bunch today.
Casey D: Yeah, no worries from the.
Shelly V: Gff side for my team, the data management group. We, as you're aware, we built iaf service in Domo with the help of the Domo team. We are moving to naf next. So we're going to add in our ground service to the same dashboard. So just want to let everybody know that that's next on the list. And then we kind of added a pulse on healthcare where we created a list of healthcare customers and then just kind of built some visibility off the existing service data. And so eventually we'll have iaf service for all customers, naf service for all customers. And then we're going to have that healthcare view as well. So that's just some things that we're working on our side.
Casey D: That's awesome.
Shelly V: Yeah. I'm super excited about it. It's getting a lot of traction too.
Casey D: That's great. Are you incorporating some of the Domo data that was already present for iaf and healthcare? Because I know like I think Devin, okay. Yeah, Devin did a lot of work with the healthcare team. I think Todd had some great stuff already with iaf. So.
Shelly V: Yeah, I think we're going to kind of fold what Todd had built because he had built it specifically for the us. And ours is global. Okay? So I think we're going to fold what Todd has built into ours. I've already reached out to parse on that. Okay. And then for Devin, I actually scheduled a call with him to talk through what that looks like for our customers because our reporting is more internal. So that's how we manage, you know, manage our service internally?
Casey D: Good deal. Yeah. Now, that sounds great. So, yeah, you're looking, do you, have, I know you sent me the email yesterday about the new user who actually be kind of working more hands on in Domo in terms of connecting and transforming and building content.
Shelly V: Yeah.
Casey D: Are there any, is there anybody else like, the business users who will be using this, these new app services, that need training or are they pretty much already?
Shelly V: Ongoing, I don't think so. So I personally built kind of a little navigation video, just, a quick video. Just the here's how you navigate to the tabs. Here's, how you export to excel, just simple tips, you know, a little short video. So we're using that in the interim. If anybody needs anything more than that, I might reach out. But basically it's just, you know, like I said, high level navigation tips. And then we're sending that out to the users. As we roll out the dashboard, I've created a couple of videos actually how to gain access, how to schedule a report because that's such a cool feature, especially when we're moving from excel reporting that we email right to self serve Domo. The scheduling of reports is such a cool feature. I created a little video on how to do that, and then some quick navigation tips. And then I also have an open office hour session that I host for end users if they need any navigation tips. So I'm kind of already doing that, but I'll definitely let you know if we need anything more than that.
Casey D: No, that sounds perfect. Yeah, that sounds like best practice. Yeah, I create some reputable content that you can just share out and they can absorb at their own time. But office hours that's a great idea too. Yeah, I'm glad you're doing that good deal… and you're still working with Steve nielsen and the projects team on a regular basis? Correct? Yes. Or is that? Yes? Yeah. Okay. Yeah, we.
Shelly V: Need, I think we're kind of wrapping up but I think we're still keeping those going in case Ray needs any support for all the things that I'm asking for. So we're meeting weekly just to make sure we don't need anything or if there's anything that he stumbles across, we're keeping them in our back pocket, I guess. Okay. Yeah.
Casey D: I was looking at your project hours and unless there are some that still have yet to be logged, it looks like you still have over 200 available. So.
Shelly V: That's awesome.

The call concluded with Andrew's departure and well-wishes from the Domo team.","Casey D: Andrew, hi, how are you? Happy Friday?
Andrew D: I'm here.
Casey D: Yeah. How was your week? How's your August been so far?
Andrew D: Crazy. It's our fall hunting classic started yesterday and that's a major event for us. Yeah. But if you are a shooting or ammunition or hunting type, we got good deals.
Casey D: Yeah, I don't.
Andrew D: think you're really a hunting type. Are you?
Casey D: Negative.
Andrew D: Yeah, me neither.
Casey D: Yeah, never gotten into that. But yeah, I know plenty of people who are, but cool. So what does that mean for you guys? Is it just more activity and some of the updates and reporting from sales and operations and all that sort of thing or are you still, yeah?
Andrew D: But I also work with Andy on forecasting data.
Casey D: Okay.
Andrew D: Because if, you know, we're forecasting more than we have available inventory, then we need to make a call to our vendors like right now.
Casey D: What are you using for forecasting? Is it a data science model? Is it AI or is it a mixture of, so we use magic ETL or something we?
Andrew D: Use system driven forecast from a company called churchill. But then we have the senior manager of demand planning, Jesse Knapp, you might know him, but he kind of like manually overrides certain key items during key events like this. And I'm not going to be able to explain how he does that.
Casey D: No worries… there. I mean, that is one area where Domo excels. We have data science models, machine learning. And now all of that is also integrated with AI and agents. So agents can actually make some identified, certain decisions and make those decisions and then execute the actions that are associated with those. So, anything from analyzing data to summarizing it to executing next steps or updates to the data or alerts. And that sort of thing including forecasting is all available. And all on the table right now… do you guys have, do you know if you have plans to incorporate AI into any of that forecasting?
Andrew D: Sorry, I'm working from home and my cat is trying to climb up my face. Not that I know of… but I don't really know what the forecasting guys do. I mean, I know AI is an initiative for the company as a whole.
Casey D: Okay. Yeah. If there's any opportunity for us to get in and talk through our capabilities, it's a pretty robust library at this point all the way from kind of the service layer that incorporates dumbo models, outside models, any models really all along the way to create those front end tools like chat or auto, content building or auto page or dashboard summarization, text to SQL, image to text… or vice versa, like all the way through automating all that. So, if we can ever get a seat at the table and kind of go through that, I know we'd have a lot to offer especially if you guys are just getting started in your kind of overall AI strategy right now?
Andrew D: Yeah. And I'm kind of a peon, like a lot of that's done above me.
Casey D: No worries. Yeah, no worries. What else do you guys have going on? What are you working on that we can help with? What challenges gaps, needs… issues? I.
Andrew D: Don't know if I have anything right now, but I missed the last one. I think I was out sick that day and I just couldn't go to meetings without talking to you Casey.
Casey D: I appreciate it. Andrew. I miss talking to you too. Yeah. No, we canceled last week. We canceled last week because I think Catherine had meetings and I think Robert weren't you out last week or two weeks, I don't know, but we ended up canceling.
Andrew D: Yeah, I think he was too. Yeah… but yeah, I don't know if I had one.
Robert T: I was, yeah. Okay.
Casey D: What about you, Robert? What do you have going on in your world? Anything dumb or related?
Robert T: In particular, just the same issue that Xavier has. I was just supported with and I think we finally got somewhere. It seemed that it's gotten a lot further on it. So, I think I'm good.
Casey D: Okay. Yeah. There was two cases. One was for you, Robert, one was the snowflake, oauth, failing. I think that one was fixed and just waiting on your approval. And so was the sitemetrics. KPI, do I have that right? Javier? Are we good on both of those cases and just need Robert to sign off on them.
Javier S: Yeah, there's been a lot of a lot of back and forth, on the oauth one. But yeah… there's another new change on that one. And then engineering provided an explanation on the second case, which was when, you guys were seeing a bunch of timeouts around a month ago.
Robert T: Yeah, we moved on from that, and for the oauth, with the latest change, it's worked, for a bigger chunk and that might be sufficient. However, we're still having trouble when I run the whole job just because of its size, but it's got to a sufficient point, but it'll go from there.
Javier S: Yeah. If there is still like any of the, I don't know if it's the same data set that we have been looking at. But, any problems that you're still seeing? Just let me know. I'll I'm more than happy to pass that back to engineering, but I'm glad at least,
Robert T: Yep. I will. Thank you.
Javier S: We're in the right spot.
Casey D: All right. Well, I think I just had a, some minor updates one, and I don't know if we talked about this last time, Robert and Andrew, but we are offering a technical adoption consultant for vaspro as basically like anything and everything you need help with that could be identifying, or building new use cases, optimizing existing workflows or data flows or pipelines, just, you know, solving gaps or challenges, assessing, you know… financial optimization through, you know, how and where you're consuming credits, or just an extra set of hands on keyboards if you need just some getting caught up with anything bi, analytics reporting related with Domo. So that is still on the table. We did talk with Brittany and Andy about this a couple of weeks ago, and there were some areas where Brittany saw that we could definitely, start looking at utilizing Scott or Domo consultants to help, improve some areas.

The key highlights were Domo's focus on fitting into the customer's ecosystem, the differences between Domo's and Fivetran's pricing models, and the need to address schema differences when swapping data sets. Trent also expressed concerns about Domo's credit usage and the possibility of moving some work out of Domo, which Signe acknowledged and offered to explore options to address.","Trent P: yeah.
Signe P: Tema? Perfect.
Trent P: That's it. No, we don't. hey, I see you now.
Signe P: How are you doing?
Trent P: Well, yourself? Good? Hey, hey.
Signe P: How are you?
Trent P: Doing good. Been a little bit of a busy day, but good, otherwise.
Signe P: Good. We just need matt and then we can get going. I'll just go ahead a second. There he is. Okay. Okie. Dokie, I think we've got the crew… to get started. So, Trent, I know on the other call, you guys were talking about, fivetran but then also the demo pricing and how that works. So, hoping that you can kind of ask some questions, maybe we can help clarify if there's any questions you have around the demo pricing?
Trent P: Yeah. So, I guess, right? We had questions around, how snowflake would work. And they mentioned that, hey, you can actually use Domo to get that data into fivetran. And I said, well, how would that work? Because the data that I'm looking to do, is one of them, is our, read replica for busybiz. So we currently have a read replica costs us a lot of money each year. It'd be great if we could go down scale down to either no read replica or just use their thing. I'm, going to leave that up to, Madrid, that side of the team. But the question was how do we get that data into snowflake? And so we had fivetran or we had Domo. And one thing that we were thinking about is if we're going to have this data in snowflake, we need to have the entire table. So we, some of our tables go, very large. We have member location data. So we're in the 1,000,000,000 rows. We can't we do not want to just bring in that entire table into Domo, because that would literally cost us a 1,000 credits to bring that table in. And so, based on my understanding of how Domo does credits, I don't want to bring in like I let's say I decided to bring in these 10 tables into snowflake that are in Domo. I don't want to be billed, you know, for every 1,000,000 rows that we have, because I'm not going to be, I never use those, in anything in Domo. I actually pull it in and group it by like an org or a member or a certain time period. And so like a 1,000,000,000 rows quickly goes down to just, you know, a few 1,000 or maybe 100,000. And so, my understanding of it is if I bring, I have to have a table in Domo, and I then push that table to snowflake using Domo. But I don't know how the credits are used, like how, that would work. And so, yeah, I'm really just wondering that because in my situation, it's like this would be a 1,000 credits every month, right? To bring in just one of our tables that we use a lot. And so it's like that probably doesn't make a ton of sense if we're also paying for snowflake. And so, yeah, that was really, where my question lies is, hey, how do you guys handle that?
Matt T: Yeah, Trent. So let's just use a real world example. Let's just say that you guys had a Facebook connector and you wanted to connect to Facebook and you wanted to push that directly into your snowflake instance. So you would run a job every night to grab the Facebook data that you want. And you would push that to your snowflake instance. That would cost you two credits every time you run that Facebook connector. For simplicity, let's just say you're going to run it once a night. So it's two credits a day.
Trent P: So, it's not like the chain like it's really not live data as whenever we last synced it up with Domo. Is what would be in snowflake. Is that correct?
Matt T: So you would pull that data and you would store that in snowflake, right? Just like any type of integration that you had, snowflake would be your core table that would hold all your history for that Facebook connector. So, let's just say every day you're adding a row, let's just say you're adding one row and make it simple, right? You run the connector in Domo. It automatically pushes the data to snowflake. There's no data storage in Domo. There's nothing that happens in Domo. From that standpoint, it connects to Facebook. It pushes one row to your table. At the end of the month, you have 30 runs at two credits each. So you put 60 credits. All that data is stored in your snowflake table. And you can now do a couple of different things. You can, one leave it in snowflake and render cards directly from snowflake. You could use that table that you pushed to in snowflake and use that as a source for magic ETL to transform the data. And then you can make it, then you can push that data, right? You can push the transform data right back to snowflake. Your snowflake data costs are your snowflake data costs on your side. However they're charging you for the rows of data that you're storing in snowflake is what you're paying for. All you're paying for with Domo would be the ability for you to run that connector to push it to there. It's not rows based. It's not anything. If you were to physically store the data in Domo, then you do have row cost, right? But in that example, let's just let's take it up a notch. Let's just say in that example, every single day in Domo, you were downloading, let's just say you were downloading a 1,000,000 rows for whatever reason, right? If you stored that in Domo, then at the end of the month, you would have 30,000,000 rows in Domo and you would pay storage to us for Domo, right? One credit per 1,000,000 rows. So 30 credits. So from that standpoint, you can make the decision where you want to store that if you want snowflake to be your data warehouse, your cloud data warehouse, because everything gets centralized, you can run all your other applications. You can do everything else through there. All you're using is our connector suite library to grab the data and place it in there. So.
Trent P: It won't even be stored in Domo at all. Nothing. Just want to make sure that, that's.
Matt T: yeah, correct. No storage. It's really, it's really, so, is.
Trent P: It just like a different suite of connectors or is it like, yeah, I guess I just haven't ever seen that. Yeah.

Scott B: Think… we have everyone, colt's not going to join us today, but we've got Shana, so, a couple of things Nick that we have discovered since our last… call, we ran that second document through. I haven't done any spot checking on it at all, but it was a successful run. So we've got both of those documents that I'll send over for Sheila to review for accuracy to make sure they're good. Okay?
Nick N: Yeah, I'd love to see those. Yeah.
Scott B: So, I'll send those over just after the call… Dan. Are you kind of briefed on what we're talking about here?
Dan N: Yeah, I think so.
Scott B: I assume you'll probably have some questions around how we did it because it's actually pretty interesting… based on what we went back and kind of spoke through the goal for today was to kind of get you like a desert size as far as what a complete build would be. And so, Jesse and I have taken that back internally along with Shana and we've kind of reviewed some of that, Jesse. Do you want to provide some insight into that?
Jesse W: Sure. And before I do, Daniel, I'm not sure. We've met. I'm Jesse, nice to meet you. I work in the strategic solutions area of Domo. I lead a practice around implementing solutions. One of the, so when we met a few days ago, what we told Nick was, and we showed him this sort of a sprint methodology as a way of as he accurately said, you know, de risking things, scoping it out, being certain and what he wanted to know. And we said it was about 12 and a half K to do that. And we'd credit that to the solution. And his response was well, 12 and a half of 100 is a lot different than 12 and a like give me a size of the bread box. Let me know like this 12 and a half goes towards, right? Which is a pretty fair response. And so long story short, we think it's around and I said we'd give like a rough order of magnitude estimate but not like an it estimate more like a plus minus 25 percent. And so we did some scoping and we think that the solution will come in around 45,000 plus or minus 25 percent with a 12 and a half going to that 45,000. And we broke that down into parts. But if you want me to go through that, I can, but I just want to start with that and get your reaction to that.
Nick N: What happens if we get to the end of the project and there's I mean.
Dan N: Would you commit to the 25, the 25 percent plus or minus? Would you? Yeah?
Jesse W: If you're asking, I get where you're going, right? Okay. If you're asking, so two different ways. Okay? Let's do this a little bit on the fly. I think there's two ways of addressing this, Nick and Dan, right? The first way is to say, well, we could put in some condition. Let's say if we do 12 and a half towards it, we do the scoping engagement, this sprints this bba and stuff, and we come back and we say it's actually 80, right? And you guys go, well, that's not plus minus 25 percent, right? Are you committing to this, right? Or are you going to give us back the 12 and a half, if we say now, no or something, right? We can talk about that. So that's route one. I kind of like the route though that you're saying maybe just commit in advance, just say it'll be no greater than X… right? And just the… risk of that to be transparent is if I know that in advance, my teams know that in advance, then we will try and figure out how to scope it and maybe take some nice to haves off to make that possible, right? Of course, we would have to do that. We'd have to think through how to achieve it, but we're pretty darn confident. So if you would like, I can verbally say it now and we can get Scott to put it on paper and contractually bind this to us. Sure. I'm good with a commitment of saying, let's not go into this if it's going to be greater than 25 percent more than 45, make that commitment and say if it is too bad. So sad, Domo… yeah, I think you're.
Dan N: oh, go ahead, Nick. I was just going to say, I mean, I think you're right? That if we have a fixed cost, the devil is now in the details of the scope. So we will need to probably spend some time aligning on what that scope is, which we can do. That's just my first thought. Nick, did you have something you wanted to say?
Nick N: I have a few things to say, okay?
Jesse W: The.
Nick N: way that I am approaching these conversations is that we ideally want to be able to create agents across the business.
Scott B: Right.
Nick N: This is just the first use case for the first problem that we want to solve using an AI agent. And what I would want to see at the end of this is that our team is either trained and enabled to build these themselves using this as like a training ground or there is some sort of, I… don't know. I just every time we create it, build an agent, I don't want to pay another 45,000 dollars. I guess I kind of look at this as we're getting our feet wet. I don't want you guys to build everything and maybe I want some help but it can't be this every time.
Jesse W: We asked just so you understand, Nick to that point, we estimated 20 percent of that 45 is in the enablement and the training along the way as we build this. So we broke it down into five pieces just so it's clear there's an ingestion component. Daniel just on a process point of view, the scope isn't nailed until we do this engagement and then work on the scope together and collect the requirements. And that's the purpose of the sprint. So we're doing an estimation exercise to try and help you decide should we even do the sprint. But because we've done the technical POC, we've got a pretty good view as to the complexity of building that first agent, how to train people on it.

The first meeting would cover an adoption program, lead management solution, and labor optimization opportunity, while the second would be a demo of a labor utilization app. The key focus was on Alaris' challenges with labor optimization, including difficulties in adjusting staffing levels based on occupancy rates and the need for better visibility into relevant metrics, which Domo believes it could potentially help address.","Sharr J: hello? Michel. Good morning.
Meshell R: Oh, sorry. I was on mute. Hello? Good morning.
Sharr J: No worries. Good morning.
Meshell R: I noticed there's two.
Sharr J: There we go. Good morning.
Meshell R: There's two meetings.
Benjamin P: Yep.
Sharr J: Okay. Yeah.
Benjamin P: This first one, we'd like to just go through the adoption program and sort of follow up on our last discussion and talk about the lead management solution that we brought up, and also talk a little bit about the later labor optimization opportunity. The second meeting is with John Morgan, our director of engineering, who has built a labor utilization app for another customer and he is going to give Jonathan a demo of that app during our next talk. So, bye.
Sharr J: okay. So this is the review of the next star. I was confused myself. This one. Yeah, this one's just a follow up. The next half hour will be, The demo?
Benjamin P: Yeah, because, you know, Ankit and I, we're here to help as part of the adoption program and uncover opportunities where we can provide value for you guys. John is, as I said, he's director of engineering. He's coming in to help give a demo of that solution. It was his team that built that sort of two separate groups within demo. So that's the reason we set those up separately just to ensure that there was enough time to do that demo. So.
Sharr J: Okay. So, he's going to that's strictly going to be labor optimization focused.
Benjamin P: Correct that's. Correct. Yep. So, so we can touch on that a little bit, today, and during this fall, if we'd like, but I think that based on the last discussion that we had, it sounded like the lead management was the opportunity that we could provide the quickest value. If you believe that labor optimization is a higher priority and that would provide quicker and more significant value, than lead management, then we could prioritize accordingly. But I wanted to know if you had an opportunity. I did send you some screenshots of the lead management solution that we built for another client. And so, I wanted to sort of give you a peek in, at, what we were able to build for them. In fact, this is, it sounds like it's a very, common issue amongst several organizations, that I've been working with recently, that also want the ability to, qualify their leads and have a centralized location for their teams to go in, and qualify those leads before they are created, as opportunities, in your CRM, whatever, that system may be. And so were… you, did you have an opportunity, to look at those screenshots? And do you still think that lead management, solution would be something that would provide, a lot of value, to Alaris?
Sharr J: So, I've looked at this, I don't… we've got a CRM right? Where people are going to be. So, so, yes, and no, I don't want to reinvent the wheel. We're just starting with the new CRM September tenth. So, like, I, my, just immediate concern is, okay. Do we, are we going to force people to live in two places? Yeah. Are we going to overwhelm saying, hey, learn this new CRM but I mean, let's be honest. I, I'm hoping it's not a steep learning curve at all. Given just, this is not super complex business, right? So, are we going to overwhelm and replicate efforts if we're saying, hey, we're going to learn this new CRM but also have this kind of additional… layer within a bi tool? So, you tell me for what you've shown and what you've done, did those customers already have a CRM or was… Domo basically acting essentially as that function, right? Where they had leads kind of just coming in? Maybe not… very well structured?
Benjamin P: Yeah, this.
Sharr J: Was to kind of structure around that and actually put some process in place?
Benjamin P: Typically, what I've seen at least in the solution that I, the screenshots that I provided you, they did have an existing CRM solution. What CRM solution are you guys migrating to? If you don't mind me asking?
Sharr J: It's called welcome home. Okay to very like start, you know, they're still in like startup mode, super niche product aimed at the senior living market.
Benjamin P: Yeah, cool. And do you know if they have an API?
Sharr J: They do, we're actually hitting all endpoints daily and putting into snowflake.
Benjamin P: Got it. And so what I've seen typically is organizations will have a collection of calls or opportunities and they all aren't they all aren't leads, right? And so typically, every call that comes in or every opportunity that comes in, it doesn't make a whole lot of sense, to put all of those in CRM because some of those, are junk calls. Some of them, are people who aren't interested, in doing business or for a variety of reasons, there's a usually a large number of calls for opportunities that would not qualify as a lead. And so in the CRM solutions at least that I've dealt with, there's not a good sort of prerequisite step built within the solution that allows the qualification of those leads before they get created as actual leads. And so, in the solutions that we've built, Domo has acted as that platform or, that previous step before it gets to CRM. And we can certainly leverage welcome homes API to automatically create those leads within the CRM, so that the user who's qualifying the leads, doesn't have to jump from one system to another to recreate the lead after they've had a chance to qualify that. And so that's typically what we've done. And because these solutions are custom and we can build them, you know, to whatever aesthetic needs that you're looking for, we can definitely ensure that solution or that interface closely resembles what they're seeing in welcome home to ensure that it feels like a seamless solution. In fact, we can even put links within that application that direct them directly to welcome home after the lead has been created. So that they don't have to navigate to the different platforms. They can simply Qlik that link and take them to where they want to go in welcome home. So we've done that as well. Does that answer the question?
Sharr J: That answers the question. And it's all very cool.

Bellamy Y: Yeah.
Benjamin P: Igor, yeah, yeah, it was good to hear from him. Any follow up thoughts from that call? Or do you just want to go ahead and dive into this call?
Bellamy Y: No, I think well, the only thing follow up thought from that is like, I think Ben or Shane, I would like to have you guys on the call with, careport once I set that up and, to ask whether like, how to create that custom API in Monday. Oh, sorry, in Domo?
Benjamin P: Okay.
Bellamy Y: So, just fii, on that one. I think that's really critical. So, we need to be able to do that in Domo, for our phase one build in Salesforce?
Benjamin P: Sounds good. Yeah, certainly, don't mind attending that. The only thing I did want to let you know is this Friday and, Monday, the fifteenth, I will be out of office. So, as long as it's not one of those two days.
Bellamy Y: Gotcha. So, twelfth and fifteenth. Okay. Yep. Gotcha.
Benjamin P: And… the snowflake dataset is that, is that, have you had a chance to review that?
Bellamy Y: Yeah. So I'm actually working on that right now and it's working, as expected, which is nice. So, thank you so much for helping me on that. We're good there.
Benjamin P: Awesome. Great. I'm glad that's working and so, yeah. So if you have any other datasets with a similar issue, I think that we can just take that approach, and it'll resolve the problem. So, okay. Another update, we've started pulling in some GA, ford data. So, we have, several, we have four datasets specifically that we'll need to build up the visuals that you sent us. So we're still working through building out those visualizations. So probably Wednesday, I should have more to show for that, but we do have the data, in the system. I don't know if you've had a chance to see that yet, but we do have four that we have user data. We have sessions, we have users with attributes, and then we have one that's got some more, some data such as like session duration, views per session, active users, just a variety of different things that we'll need to support, that build. So, we'll continue working on that over the next couple days, and I'll provide you with a, an update on Wednesday where we're at with those. So, you should have, and I'm, also planning, to make more progress on, the maps this week. And so, the GA, iv stuff is being worked on, by one of our, one of the members of the team. His name is kushkar. I don't think you've met him, but he's working on the GA, iv stuff and I'm working on the mapping. And so, between the two of us, we're sort of doing getting two different things done all at the same time. So, thank.
Bellamy Y: You… how's the mapping stuff going?
Benjamin P: Still working on it, it's, there's a… with the testing on, it's more of a Domo app deployment type thing that I'm trying to figure out nothing specific to, Kepler, but I'm getting close to having that in a place where I can start testing on the local environment. It's working in the instance. But obviously, as I'm doing my development, I need it to work locally, because obviously, I can't write code and then deploy it to your instance just to see if that code worked. So having it work locally is going to be, very helpful. So, I've about got that. And then, it is pulling in data, your actual data from your instance, to my local device that's that was good. And then, I'll start mapping that data too actual like visuals, pretty soon. So, I think you had mentioned wanting sort of like a bar like bars for, address counts within a certain geographical region. Is that correct?
Bellamy Y: Yeah, we can start there, with the, I think the aggregation logic is going to be critical for this because I don't want to see like one bars like all throughout, but I want to be able to have like smart groupings.
Benjamin P: Yeah… I think that. Well, I'll check and see, I'm sure, I feel fairly certain that campo has, some grouping algorithms that we can leverage for that. And so, I'll let you know, as I dive into that when I find out.
Bellamy Y: Okay.
Benjamin P: So, as far as, other data needs for the, Ta, dashboard, we… needed some additional data from Monday. Is that correct?
Bellamy Y: Yes.
Benjamin P: Okay. Shane, don't, you have experience with the Monday, graphql connector?
Shane W: Yeah, I do.
Benjamin P: Okay. So, Robert wrote, a jupyter workspace that's currently pulling Monday com, data into the 20 first centuries instance. And so, we'll probably just need to add, some additional reports to that jupyter workspace to support the talent acquisition dashboard that we're building out as the first departmental dashboard.

I have, this is what I found in the forum, allow scheduled reports for people outside your instance, but I had others check to see if they had this because I'm an admin. So it's hard to see, you know, hard to know what other people have. So, I had a couple of people check that were not admins, and they didn't have this view. Yeah.
Mamta B: That's fine because that's a global setting.
Shelly V: It is a global setting. Is it only for admins, though?
Mamta B: Yes.
Shelly V: It is only for admins. So I can add people that are not in our instance as an admin. So, if they're not in Domo, I can share reports, but not any single user can do so. Is that correct?
Mamta B: No, restate that for me, please. So this is just a setting saying that, hey, you are allowing people outside of your organization… to be like a scheduled report to be sent to people outside your organization, right? It's just a setting, right? Who can actually send will depend on again, the roles and permissions that you have for creating scheduled reports.
Shelly V: I don't like having.
Mamta B: Some roles for scheduled reports. But, yeah.
Shelly V: And so we want our, so we only grant access in most cases to supervisors and above. So ideally, we would like everyone to have the ability to share with their direct reports without necessarily bringing them into Domo. Like we don't want all of our admins in Domo as an example, right? And so the management team would like to go into Domo and automate reports to send to their direct reports to action without getting them in Domo. So we really need this capability for all of our users.
Mamta B: Okay. Give me a second. I'm just scheduling just adding.
Shelly V: Okay.
Mamta B: Because the PDP policy, in case you have PDP policy at the backend, right on that dataset, then technically, that user is not added in Domo. So, so then, yeah, and.
Shelly V: we don't have a PDP? These would just be our operational dashboards.
Mamta B: Yeah. Let's just see. Yeah, I have sent that app, like I sent, like I can share my screen if.
Shelly V: Yeah, please.
Mamta B: I just don't know what you're experiencing. So let's just see if this is what?
Shelly V: It is. Yeah, I'm still trying to find that email.
Mamta B: So, this one, I basically logged into the ups uad instance, this is the dashboard. I tried sending dashboard to myself and this is my Gmail personal address and you can see it's saying private dataset and it's saying private dataset. Because this dataset like this has a PDP. And only, if I have, a policy, in this case, the user has to be added into Domo and he needs to have a policy right now, what I've done is I've gone ahead and scheduled this one. I've just sent this one out. Let's just see if just one second. Okay. And I did get include… 16 cards, but why don't, I see 16 cards? Hold on. So I have sent this one out and I can see data. The only thing I don't see is send daily to two people.

Virginia C: Hello? Oh, I can't hear you. Hold on. Let's make sure.
Brian F: can, you can't hear me?
Virginia C: There you are.
Brian F: Hello?
Virginia C: Sometimes my computer tries to push sound output through my microphone.
Brian F: I don't know why that doesn't work.
Virginia C: No, no.
Brian F: I think that's an microsite. What are you doing today?
Virginia C: Oh, good. How are you? Well, you either froze or you're sitting really still?
Brian F: Oh, no… you're back. Sorry, you were frozen for a minute.
Virginia C: I said, so you asked how I was, I said I'm okay. How are you? And then you froze and I was like, oh, he's dead. How are you? He's got it. Okay?
Brian F: I said that it was, I said, I'm glad it's Friday. I'm doing okay, but it's been a week.
Virginia C: It's one of those survive the weeks.
Brian F: First week back at school kids. People ask me for a lot of stuff, a lot of fire drills. I need this done today kind of thing. So.
Virginia C: The answer is no.
Brian F: Next time I have a client ask me for something today, I'll make sure to let you tell them that.
Virginia C: It's no skin on my back.
Brian F: Like I'll do whatever I.
Virginia C: don't know… but me, you can't say no to me.
Brian F: I know, well, let's see that's why you tell them no, so you can monopolize my time.
Virginia C: Perfect. That's helpful.
Brian F: So, sounds like a plan. Yeah.
Virginia C: Well, we've solved all the world's problems. So, good call. Cool. Okay. No. So you, we scheduled this because you wanted the update on how the meeting went. Yes, an unforeseen blocker came up.
Brian F: Okay.
Virginia C: The budget for Domo was cut in March.
Brian F: Okay. And.
Virginia C: I was unaware because I was not in my role at that time and the people who made that decision are no longer with the firm so that the decision was made and then not like it was communicated to accounting. But it wasn't communicated down to me a user of the tool and up to the CMO. So that's not to say that I can't make a business case, but I can't give intent to renew. I can only give intent to cancel for what I perceived to be the deadline which was September fourth or fifth. I think was what I had in my notation of when I needed to give intent to you guys by… the CMO has in his notations that we… are with Domo through the end of October. So I think this is where Stuart would be part of the conversation is, can… we have more time before we give intent? Because I think that the door is open to continue the conversation because budget season for us is approaching… okay. But at this point,
Brian F: like hands are tied kind.
Virginia C: Of hands are tied and. And his mind is sort of… not focused on this area. So I'm going to have to not just build a case for Domo but build a case as to… how the team embraces analytics period and why they matter.
Brian F: Why analytics matters?
Virginia C: Not, I mean not analytics, but like… why these numbers? Why, why are we looking at the performance of our digital properties rather than the performance of our people talking to the people that we're trying to convert? Like what I have to tell that story and make that business case of if I get the analytics all in one spot and I can show that story. What… does that, what value does that bring?
Brian F: Yes, and well, I mean… so I hear you. So he's saying his, so if I'm understanding what you're saying is we built data, we built dashboards around marketing and your digital marketing plan. And so you have analytics for that. And you're saying that he is, his focus is on how the account people sales people are performing, is that?
Virginia C: How marketing is supporting them in moving that needle? What are we doing? That's? Moving the needle so great that we've got greater traffic, but did it drive? Like, what… did it, we've got more traffic. Did we get more people that we want to talk to from it or was it just traffic for the sake of traffic? Like that? We've got to start telling the story. Yeah, beyond just, we've optimized our website here's, the social things that are performing. So really putting together that analytics… storytelling strategy of here's, what we intend to report on.
Brian F: Yeah.
Virginia C: To help us drive the conversations with our selling partners such that they can move the needle further along too.
Brian F: And I know we didn't we touched on this, but I know we didn't really talk about it. Do you, when somebody comes to the website, do you have like white papers, requests for demos and that sort of thing? So you've got like bottom of funnel actions that we are currently not reporting on?
Virginia C: Yeah. So that's that insights page that I was pointing you at that's where our content lives.
Brian F: And we can. And so what I built for you is we can see how many people are going to that page or to that, yeah… how many people are going to those pages to the insights pages and show that. And then, so the next question is we can even say show where they're going to… AI, governments and state agencies. Is the top landing page… this week?
Virginia C: I think there's a story and I think it can be told and I think a petition for budget… could go well, but if we need to know right now, the answer is no.
Brian F: Yeah. Okay. Let me, I'll circle back with them on that and I think so. I guess in my head where I'm trying to think about this story is what I hear you saying is you want something very specific around. I need to show, I need to be able to share these metrics and show what marketing is doing for the company. We need to justify marketing's existence. It's the same old story. I've seen it a 1,000 times before, especially hard when you've got a content based website, right? And everybody's constantly like, okay, well, cool. You increased traffic, but did you do, what did you do for me, right? So I get that. I think we can go down that route. I think, the other side of that is demo as a tool. Demo can help you get there. It can also help with sales. It can help track your sales people. And I guess it's to me, it's two different things I think for you.

Brian F: Not too bad. How are you doing today?
Shivam M: I'm doing good.
Brian F: Excellent. Well. So, I'm… sure. There's others that are going to join. But so, the only question you had was about connecting to sharepoint. Is that correct?
Shivam M: Yes, yes, yes, yes. Like I tried getting data from sharepoint, but unable to get so, and I tried to go through videos available on YouTube, but I was unable to find anyone specific to that.
Brian F: Yeah.
Shivam M: I can see the folder in which that particular file excel file is, which I want to fetch there, you know, but, you know, unable to get the file exactly.
Brian F: Yeah… we are. I know Nick was looking into that. Yeah, you can share.
Shivam M: Me. Any documentation related to that, you know, that is not the priority. That was just the thing which was in my mind that's not the only thing actually.
Brian F: Yeah, yeah. So based on my understanding that like connecting to sharepoint is a little finicky. And I think he was, Nick was going to be looking into it because I think there has been… yeah, like I said, it's a little finicky connecting to it.
Nik K: Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Oh two.
Brian F: Minutes. He said, no, no, no. Hold on. He's still typing? Sorry, no.
Shivam M: Problem.
Brian F: Everything else, is.

Brian F: The Diwali?
Shivam M: Yes, yes, yes, it is on the twentieth of October.
Brian F: You guys are already, it's like two weeks out. You're sounds like you're really excited about it huh?
Shivam M: Because there are a lot of stuff we do before Diwali, you know, coloring our houses, renovation, cleaning, you know, lighting our houses, everything, you know, starts prior to that shopping, you know, gifts for family, everything.
Brian F: Yeah. Is that, is it more than the, than the week before or like… when does like, when does it really start?
Shivam M: It actually, it like there is a major day and like it usually goes for three days and, but the celebration, you know, the party vibes, the festival vibes, it usually starts like two, three weeks prior. The main thing is that the motto here is that the goddess will come to your house if your house is clean, right? So, it starts from this by renovating your house again.
Brian F: Yeah. All right. Well, very cool. All right. We got Nick most importantly, Nick, but also.
Shivam M: Juliana.
Brian F: Juliana one, you're one B, let's be honest… in today's. I'm like fourth or fifth, but Nick is the real one that's coming with answers for sharepoint, right? Nick?
Nik K: Sure. We'll work through it. Sharepoint's hard. That's why I'm not like full of confidence, but we'll get it working. So.
Brian F: Yeah. I did tell him that connecting to sharepoint was a little finicky.
Nik K: Okay. Yeah. Zeya, do you want to just dive in some connector?
Shivam M: Yes, I'm sure we will.
Nik K: And yeah, did you try the one drive for business connector?
Shivam M: Yeah, I tried one drive for business also, and what happened that it is showing the folder in the one drive connector in which that actual excel file is, but I'm unable to see that excel file. Not able to get one drive connector is also good like anyways, which if I am able to get that excel file to update that particular data set in Domo. Because right now, from last two to three weeks, what I'm doing, I'm manually uploading the property list.
Nik K: Okay. Yeah, yeah.
Shivam M: Yeah. Let's try with the business one.
Nik K: Okay. Do you want to pull up your screen? Yeah, yeah.
Shivam M: Give me a second. My screen is visible, right?
Nik K: Yes. Okay. Thank you.
Shivam M: So, I should go with this one, right? Yes. Just give me a second. Let me authenticate? For some reason, it's saying my client id and secret has expired.
Brian F: Okay.
Nik K: So,
Shivam M: do we have any documentation related to this? I can go through that.
Nik K: Yeah. So if you go to the connector, there should be documentation there.
Shivam M: On the info page for that, right?
Nik K: The info page, and then on the right side, there's a bar, which has a power up guide. Yeah. So if you do learn more about this?
Shivam M: Connector, yeah, and.
Nik K: then on the right there, you have read the power up guide. So this goes into all the details… yeah.
Shivam M: Okay. I'll go through this? That was the only thing which I was thinking of.
Nik K: Okay. Yeah. And you have admin access to create client ids and secrets, right? Yes. Okay. So that, yeah, I think if you can try that one, the sharepoint connector will work very similarly. I mean, if you create an app in azure, right? You should be able to get to it… and use the sharepoint connector with similar credentials.
Shivam M: Thank you so much, Nick.
Nik K: Did you try the pure sharepoint connector directly?
Shivam M: I'll show you which one I tried… just give me a second.
Nik K: Peace. Yes, if you Qlik that one.
Shivam M: I tried this.
Nik K: Yeah.
Shivam M: So,
Nik K: if you Qlik this, like what happens if you, when you tried this one?
Shivam M: I added the account. So now… like it's showing me these options only. So I go through this, you know, sub folder. And then I, if you try.
Nik K: Files files, okay? Files.
Shivam M: Yeah. And then when I went back to my sharepoint, and according to a description, what I got from here, I pasted this but unable to get the data. So, I think the issue which I'm facing is that I am unable to get the right server related URL that's my thinking?
Nik K: Okay. I'm just trying to see the structure of the URL. So, for sites?
Shivam M: I'll pull up the URL pretty quick. What was the file? Just allow me a moment. So, yeah. So this is the actual file which I'm trying to get in Domo, through this connector. So I tried my best like, you know, working things around pasted through formats, tried to go through YouTube through the documentation, but I think the only issue which I'm facing is that I'm unable to get the right server related URL?

Ted S: fine. I'm doing you a favor. I feel better. Yeah.
Juliana J: Yeah.
William W: Ted, super… excited to talk with you about the manning project dude. Now that I've gotten my hands in there. I mean, I wanted to give you a shout out. I think you're the one that's pulling the strings on that other dashboard, but I think you've done a great job on that app that you had built, the one that's running off the ops data set, that ETL, you guys are, first of all, there's like 200 frickin' columns in that thing, it's insane. The data that you're pulling into that data set is fantastic dude. And then the way that you guys are standing it up in there, it's simple. It's all you need. But like, I think you guys did a good job of making sure that you're getting good signal on that data so that you guys can prioritize. And then I think now that I understand a little bit better what we're gonna be able to do with the manning project app, I think it's really gonna help you guys out. So.
Ted S: Yeah, we're excited about it. It's the current way that we're going about it is less than optimal. So definitely excited that we just have a data driven approach to how we're manning people to projects.
William W: Well, Julia and I tried to buy you some time. How are we doing?
Juliana J: Okay. Yeah, I'm good. I have our calendars pulled up for next week. It's a little tight next week just because of the holidays. Would you guys be okay with a 30 minute call on Tuesday next week instead of an hour? And we can go over some quick updates, maybe, yeah.
Ted S: Around the same time then?
Juliana J: We let's see what time is it right now? So we could do earlier. We could do, you guys are Central Time, so we could do one 30 to two central or?
Ted S: Eastern eastern, but, okay.
Juliana J: You're eastern? Okay. So.
Ted S: I can do, yeah, after one, what does that end up being? Trying to do some math after two?
Juliana J: 32 33 that?
Ted S: That would work. Okay. Yeah, throw it out there that'll work for me too all.
Juliana J: Right. Sounds good. I will reschedule next week's, call. Then I'll send that over now just so I don't forget. All right, awesome. So our agenda for today, I wanted to add one item to the top of the agenda, which is updates on the manning project, so we can do that. And then we can jump into skills matrix, talk about that a little bit and where we're at there. And then we just need to complete our roadmap. And then I do want to time box like 15 minutes at the end of the call to go over data connections for the customer health dashboard. So, wherever we're at with the roadmap, we'll pause to make sure we have 15 minutes at the end of the call to cover that, because I know we want to get moving with that. So anything else you guys want to add to the agenda today? I know we have a little jam packed agenda, but.
Ted S: That sounds good.
Juliana J: All right. Sounds good. I believe that will, maybe Nick has updates on the manning project, so I will hand it over to one of them. Okay?
Ted S: So,
William W: I'm gonna preface and say this is in flight. So you're gonna see some ugly stuff in there, but the spirit of it is what it, you know, what we're looking to kind of share. And then I'm gonna leave this up Ted just so that you're you can gain some familiarity with it as you would like. I don't plan to put you in the business, but if you have questions about the back end, I want to make sure that I'm not hiding that behind the curtain so that you can ask those if you need to. So on. So yeah. So this is pro code editor. I won't go too into the sausage making as they say. But ultimately what I'm working on right now is we've got functionality that looks very similar to what Nick had presented. You can see there's a little bit of hang up going on. But again, I'm massaging out the issues. This is what I'm working on right now. So it looks a little bit ugly. But ultimately, and then these calculations I need to make sure that these are right, the progress that was made most recently is wiring the data in off of the two data sets that you've created, Ted or whoever had created. So we've got the payroll data set to pull in on the names of the individuals. It's truncated right now. So I was curious if you guys want me to make it so that the entire name is visible here or if you want to hover over like if you hover over, it gives you the full name or do you want like, the full name and the employee number and everything visible no matter what like obviously this is a problem, but I'm curious like how much you need visible from the welders names?
Ted S: Typically a last name would be sufficient. And I think that'd be an existing column. There are some where we probably would need a first initial there too. So what you have there should work? Yes. Yeah. What you have there definitely works if we need to trim off that employee number, that would be fine too. We don't really use that on a day to day though. It's just a unique field to actually group by. But if he has it like that and then you hover and it gives you the whole thing, then yeah, that'd be it. Yes. Will.
William W: You say that last part again? If you, what was the question the hover over?
Ted S: You can leave it like that and have the hover over if that's not like a big ask.

Scott B: Yeah, exactly. And I need to find more.
Shana B: Wait, are we in a different room than shailaja's, in?
Scott B: I don't know.
Shana B: Because I feel like she just sent an email saying, are we having this meeting? And I feel like we are in this meeting and she's not here. Let.
Scott B: Me respond to her. Meeting, URL, don't know.
Shana B: Oh, wait, no. Is that the same, what is?
Scott B: The same, I'll leave and then try to join the link from the email that she sent. How about that?
Shailaja G: Okay.
Scott B: Okay. Here we are again.
Shana B: It kicked me out when you left, but I'm back in and she's still not here. I wonder if she went to the, it wasn't last time, like I sent out a random link, although that should not have been recurring. I wonder if she somehow is in that room?
Scott B: You want to try to Qlik on that one? Go to that one and then come back.
Shana B: Trying to remember when was that? And is it on my calendar?
Scott B: I like having this 30 second delay on me, you know, that I have, except for times like this.
Shana B: When you want it to instantly send, yeah.
Scott B: Yeah, I'm like, ah, just go already.
Shana B: People are like, hurry, send an email. We're gonna be waiting, you're like, yeah, I sent it, oh, wait, but it's thinking about it.
Scott B: Yeah, I wish that outlook had the option to send immediately.
Shana B: Just say like I want to overwrite that.
Scott B: Yeah.
Shana B: Or I just get rid of the delay because realistically, I only turn that on because one time I wanted to snatch something back.
Scott B: I know, I mean, I use it probably once a month, you know, like it saves me every now and then, like the biggest thing is when I want to send somebody an email address. And then, so I put it, in the to place and then forget to delete it. And then I send the email.
Shana B: Oh, yeah.
Scott B: I don't know what happened? We were waiting for you, and then maybe there's two links out there. I don't know.
Shailaja G: No, it said the host logged the meeting and I understood. Okay, we did bombard your meeting the other time.
Scott B: Oh, that's what it was. So, I was on another call and it was just me.
Shailaja G: But it's good. It's good that, it says the message, but it didn't yeah, I didn't know like if we are doing another meeting like we did last time, just with Shana. Yeah.
Scott B: Gotcha. Yeah, anyway, how?
Shailaja G: Have you been Bob?
Scott B: Like really good. It's starting to get cold here as, you know, but other than that, we turned on our furnace for the first time today this morning.
Shailaja G: You did? Yeah.
Scott B: It's kind of colder up here in Logan, you know? Okay, it was like 42 degrees this morning.
Shailaja G: Oh, really? Yeah, it's not that cold here.
Scott B: Yeah, yeah.
Shailaja G: It's outside but, yeah.
Scott B: It's interesting every time the furnace turns on for the first time in the year, it like has like a smell and it just like starts to smell like fall like winter, you know? Yeah, like burning. Yeah. So, anyway, how have you been?
Shailaja G: I've been good. Yeah, just busy with our regular projects and things like that.
Scott B: Yeah. Good. I noticed you guys had some cleanup on your runs, etls and stuff like that?
Shailaja G: Did you notice something on our credits? Is that how I was able to see? Yeah.
Scott B: Okay. Yep. There's a pretty significant decrease in credit usage. I just assumed that maybe you slowed some stuff down.
Shailaja G: It's just that I think the jupyter notebooks thing and… okay. Yeah.
Scott B: Oh, yeah. Yeah. Okay. I remember. So, there's those jupyter jobs that we just moved out, that's probably it. Yeah.
Shailaja G: That is it, because.
Scott B: that was accounting for like….
Shana B: yeah, because the other stuff looks about equal. Yeah, it was like a 1,000 credits of jupyter.
Scott B: Yeah. Okay. That's what it was. Yeah.
Shailaja G: And how are we looking in September? I haven't really not checked.
Scott B: September. You guys are good. I mean, so far we're consuming you're on route to just over 400 credits for the month and we're about halfway through.
Shailaja G: Yeah. So even if you end up at 800 to 1,000 credits…, that's.
Scott B: about where you'll be?
Shailaja G: Yeah.
Scott B: 800 to a 1,000, so, and you're fine. Yeah, I mean, that gives you plenty of run room even if you just continue down that path, like for the rest of the… I mean, you're gonna run out if we do a 1,000 a month, we only have 10,000 for the year. So you'll run out, but you've got a couple more months before we have to have that competition.
Shailaja G: Yeah. So, you saw my note, right? Scott, I did ask Robert, hey, are you okay that we would lose out on this deal? And he's like, yeah, I just want this year to go by and if he wants to have that contract conversation early next year before the, it's due for right now, right? Like, yeah.
Scott B: Let's get past December, yeah.
Shailaja G: Exactly.
Scott B: We can have a conversation, I think because.
Shailaja G: Brand new year. It's easy for brand new budgets. Yeah.
Scott B: And.
Shailaja G: to have those big conversations so that's where he's I'm like, okay, Robert, I see your point of view. Yeah.
Scott B: I get it. If it's a business need, then we'll accommodate it's. Fine. Yeah. So obviously, anytime that there's like an early purchasing of credits, we try to incentivize that, but at the same time, like it's if you end up buying credits in the future, a little.
Shailaja G: bit is fine. Yeah, I'm not.
Scott B: It's fine. Like they, the, I can't incentivize it as much, but at the same time like, you know, it's fine. So.
Shailaja G: Yeah. Okay. So that's where we stand. And then there was one topic I did want to discuss wi",Consumption Pricing Model,28000.0,Corporate,ENVEDABIO.COM,2,Life Sciences,1,$10M to <$25M,,,,,,,,,,,,,001Vq0000021RTFIA2

The key highlights were Domo's potential to provide a more effective solution compared to Corbin Advisors' current Cortex-based approach, and the exploration of integrating Domo's AI capabilities with Corbin Advisors' Snowflake data to enable conversational interaction and insights extraction.","Ankit S: hey, Mackenzie. How are ya?
Mackenzie E: Hey, good. How's it going?
Ankit S: Good. Just a few minutes. And I guess while we're waiting for him, one thing we want to try to do today if we can is… just trying to go through our roadmap and just figuring out more of like requirements we want to have for the engagement… and then eventually taking it back to our scoping consultants to figure out a level of effort on the hours. Of course, those hours come at no cost. We're just trying to get that done before the end of the month. So, I know there's certain topics that we're trying to focus on like the last couple of weeks like, I know we talked pro code editor, AI agent stuff, which we actually may have an additional consultant join today to talk through that. And then just more like app studio, visual stuff, trying to get more inspiration for, you know, building out… even if it comes down to just training education that's what we'll kind of like place into the roadmap for what we see happening. But yeah, I guess, is there aside from those things that we've discussed like, is there anything else that you feel like we want to just do a little bit more discovery on in the next week or so?
Mackenzie E: I think that's it from my perspective. I'm hoping that Teddy's able to join this call today because he's really like our key Domo slash our internal business analyst. He handles most of the Domo related things. So I'm hoping he can join it, but that's all on my agenda.
Ankit S: Okay, cool. Hey, Shane. Hey, how's it going? Awesome. Cool. We have Manya too. Nice.
Shane W: Yeah. So Manya's kind of a, we wanted to talk about AI today and Manya's built some really cool things. And so I wanted her to be on to kind of walk through AI… how to use it and we can record this call if it's not being recorded so that we can share it. If Teddy can't make it. Yeah, sounds good. The other thing I was thinking is have you guys looked at workflows at all? Is that something that you guys have we talked about that at all?
Mackenzie E: We use them a little bit but really just so that other people can initiate workflows, we'll embed a button on a dashboard so that people can run them without doing some silly nonsense?
Shane W: Okay. I didn't know if that's something that maybe we wanted to talk about… anyways, but today we want to focus on AI and kind of how people are using it and maybe generate some ideas of how you guys can use it. Awesome. Yeah. So Mani, I don't know. Do you want to lead? Do you want me to lead and kind of just start talking about things? It's up to you?
Manya D: I'm good with either I'm just connecting my monitor.
Ankit S: Well, Mani, while you're doing that and we'll give you a second for an intro. Once you get that set up, Shane, I was just telling Mackenzie that basically during next week's session, it would be great to just have our roadmap completed on our end to then present to Mackenzie and the team and then get a sign off by the end of next week. So probably a lot of the stuff that we've all been talking about, AI agents, pro code editor, workflows, if we're going to throw that in as well, and then just more general app studio, visual dashboarding stuff… but just an agenda through the next week essentially to complete.
Shane W: Perfect. Awesome.
Manya D: I finally am connected to my other monitor Ankit. Were you just listing like all Domo features?
Ankit S: Yes, no, yeah. I mean, I guess this is some of the stuff that we've been focusing on for the last couple of weeks and this is what the Corbin team was really trying to key in on. I don't know as much as you Manya, I'm going to hand it to you now. I just tried to use the biggest words that I know from what I've learned… I'm just a project manager, just kidding.
Manya D: Okay. So my monitor is connected. I can either share the couple of different things we have. Oh, I forgot my intro. I'm a senior tech consultant on Shane's team kind of just follow Shane like a puppy dog. Most of my identity is just being a data nerd and I'm obsessed with my dogs and that's literally… everything about me.
Mackenzie E: Nice to meet you. My name is Mackenzie. I'm our data scientist here at Corbin. I handle most software, dev things. My colleague Teddy if he joins is our business analyst.
Manya D: We're meeting you, Mackenzie. So we want to do it. Do you just want to like explore the options we have? Or like what we could do with AI or do you have like any specific use case in mind? Or even if it's just like broad things, broad areas where you would want to integrate it?
Mackenzie E: Yeah. I wish I had something more narrow but I'm sure you guys are under the same issue, but we get a 1,000,000 different use cases every day of people asking AI for xyz purpose. The only real business use case that we're leveraging AI really effectively right now is against unstructured data which we've housed in snowflake. And we're running cortex on it, and we built an application on top of it that just lets you interact conversationally with that unstructured data. But we're having some issues with the backend retrieval model where it's not quite what we need it to do. And snowflake doesn't really give me the option to not use that backend retrieval system. So we're considering moving it or integrating an MCP from openai, and then embedding it on Domo so users could conversationally interact on Domo. But really with openai serving as the retrieval mechanism to this data that's housed in snowflake. I'm sorry, that's a lot of backwards loops. So.
Manya D: What's the unstructured data?
Mackenzie E: It's all transcript data. So it's all text data, which is great and we've semi structured it when we stored it into snowflake. So we have like several attributes of like metadata attached to it. So it's stored really cleanly. But the use cases is usually a business analyst on our team wants high level insights, summaries data points from all these transcripts, documents and we'll either filter down, drill down, but they're trying to extract insights from a bunch of text data.
Manya D: We have, we could do that in Domo too.

Andrew D: Hey, sorry, guys.
Casey D: No worries. How are you today?
Andrew D: I'm alive. I'm dealing with some of the stupidest people and requests you could imagine, but.
Casey D: Oh, no… it was a short week though. Didn't it go back quicker for you? There was only four days.
Andrew D: No, no, it didn't.
Casey D: I'm sorry, man.
Andrew D: That's fine. I mean, they, a week or two ago, they dropped two more critical, highest level priority projects on me and said we need this by Q4. I'm like, and you're just now telling me in late August?
Casey D: Yeah.
Andrew D: And it's like, okay, you guys all need to understand that you cannot call more than one thing the highest most critical level priority in the company?
Casey D: It can't all be a one priority. There has to be an a two, an a three, a B1.
Andrew D: I mean, I need you guys to all get together, figure out what is actually the highest priority.
Casey D: Oh, that is a bummer. So, are these related to the snowflake migration? Or is it more like report?
Andrew D: These are actual like operational projects now, in addition to they want the snowflake migration complete? Like two months ago… it's fine. It's fine.
Casey D: Are you guys, is your team also responsible for converting some of the new reports and everything to Power BI? Are you having to learn Power BI along with all this?
Andrew D: I don't even know what I'm doing anymore. It's fine.
Casey D: Well, because we talked to Andy and Brittany. They said there's some, the lines of business should still be able to decide kind of what tool they use, but I wasn't sure what that meant in terms of volume of things being created new in Power BI versus what's sticking around in Domo or if you know what the plan is.
Andrew D: I don't know if I know what the plan is, man. I mean, I'm just a developer.
Casey D: Yeah… no worries. Yeah. So we offered, we have a new technical adoption resource too that we offered too, which could help like let me know if you need help with anything Domo related. I don't know if is some of the operational priorities you're getting put on your plate related to Domo and kind of the data bi strategy or is it?
Andrew D: It's just related to all… sorts of different things.
Casey D: Okay. Well, if it is something like more hands on the keyboard for Domo work, let me know because our leadership did offer bass pro, a free technical resource with the idea that they can help you know, anything from kind of recreating some of the content you have or identifying improvement or automation and AI type solutions, anything like that or even just like reworking data flows or rebuilding things, you know, that kind of thing. So, if there's anything that you could use an extra pair of hands with, just let me know we can see if it qualifies. So, what else do you have going on besides? I guess a one operational priorities and the migration.
Andrew D: Well, three different, a one priorities. Oh.
Casey D: Yeah, that's right. Three three. I forgot it.
Andrew D: And they're all the most critical the.
Casey D: Three. Yeah. Is there any work being done on Domo these days or is it kind of still in the holding pattern of?
Andrew D: Waiting there's work done everywhere. So, I know that I know that you guys were emailed about. Hang on. Give me a second. Sure.
Casey D: Javier, are there any open cases in the queue while we're waiting? I didn't see any earlier this week.
Andrew D: I do not think so.
Casey D: No.
Andrew D: Okay. So, yeah. What I was gonna say, I know you guys got emailed about critical jobs running for a long time and I tried to explain this and I guess I failed to adequately explain it, but that was, the problem was on our data warehouse, not with Domo. So that's why you guys didn't get a ticket about it. Okay? I think we got that fixed. There was it's called a spu, a snippet processing unit. There was a spu that was bad on the Tisa that when it goes down, it has to redistribute the query processing across the remaining spus, but then it's running at limited capacity, so that's why things were slow. Okay. Yeah, nothing that I'm not going to expect you to come out and fix our IBM hardware for us.
Casey D: Yeah. We do have snowflake partners that can help with the snowflake piece of it but IBM, the Tisa, well.
Andrew D: Yeah. We're we're going to be off of the Tisa here soon that needs, I am ready to replicate a very specific scene from office space against that hardware.
Casey D: Yeah, like taking it out to the field and beating it with a bat?
Andrew D: Well, that, but also the state's largest arsenal is over here about 50 feet away from me in our warehouse. So we got a lot of black powder we can throw at it.
Casey D: Yeah. There you go. Oh man. I'm sorry, your struggle, man. So, I mean, hopefully, I mean the end result is to make things so much easier for you to manage, right? Because that's kind of what the strategy Brittany and Andy were talking about simplifying things, creating data stores in the different lines of business so they can self serve and manage their own thing. And then you guys can focus on kind of the bigger broader or, you know, wider sweeping type things that, and not be so reloaded. Yeah, that's the hope anyway, my hope anyways.
Andrew D: I think we'll get there.
Casey D: Okay. Yeah. It's just a lot. Yeah, we offered the same resource our technical adoption person to Brittany because she mentioned some of the things like with governance like improving the alerts and notifications, anomaly detection, kind of looking at optimizing the reporting schedules and that sort of thing. So she hasn't gotten back to us but those are things we can also help with. So we're just kind of waiting in the wings for you guys to let us know where and how we can help… as far as updates.

Stuart R: right. Well, I think, you know, I just want to do my part in kind of introducing you two and kind of kick starting this whole motion. So maybe… just a quick kind of like rundown from my part. So Brian knows this, I've been kind of petitioning internally to help you, Virginia at north highland get some additional support, internal support, free support to help in kind of this problematic situation that really isn't anyone's fault except just kind of bad timing. So, Brian, essentially, when north highland signed up for a contract about a year and a half ago… they signed a two year agreement and the main champions that purchased the agreement, you know, implemented or did, you know, about 40 hours with our initial implementation? And then, you know, I think they were gone from north highland within a couple weeks of the agreement being signed. And then it basically just kind of fell to like a new person and a new person just kind of got kicked down the road a few times until Virginia took on ownership, but she kind of took over Domo. Not really knowing what was built. You know, they were trying to replicate a couple reports that were built in a different bi platform Power BI, and ultimately it's just not really providing as much value as it, you know, obviously is intended to provide Virginia's on the marketing side. She reports it to the CMO and, you know, they're really trying to build out better marketing visibility for north highland. Virginia can obviously go into some of those, you know, metrics that they're looking to do. But we had scoped out with a member of our service team, you know, what it would kind of take if we were to do this all via service. And I've sent that to you. Brian, let me know if you need me to resend it or if you haven't seen it. But that does detail a little bit of kind of what Virginia is hoping to do. And, but anyway really excited that, you know, we're able to get you some additional support. Brian, you can maybe do a quick intro and then maybe Virginia if you want to just cap off anything I've left out. But maybe Brian, I'll turn it over to you and kind of your role and what you're you know, kind of the intent of this project?
Brian F: Yeah. So my name is Brian Fentress. I have to start everything like that. Otherwise I get lost. So sorry, my name is Brian Fentress. I've been here at Domo for a little over six years. Now, prior to that, I was on the client side for three years. My, all of my career has been in marketing and specifically like marketing analytics. So I've done everything, maybe give you a hint of how old I am. I used to produce lists for catalog mailing lists and kind of like think about Cabela's and sending those magazines out. So I've been around a while on the marketing side, transitioned to digital, a lot of digital stuff. So most of my, and then, so also, yeah, most of my, what my SME and what I do the most is like building dashboards and things like that, understanding what it is that you're trying to get out of it and what your business goals are, and then building dashboards to help you kind of get to those business goals. What this program is built to do is to come in and help companies and people like you that are maybe having trouble getting up and running on Domo. Just kind of help you get going, help you get over the hump and show you the value of Domo and what it can do for you. And yeah, just… make sure you're getting use out of it and make sure making your life easier. That's really what my goal is.
Virginia C: Excellent. That's exciting context to have, I think to give you my spiel, I'm Virginia Crandall. I started with north highland in January of 24. I picked up Domo in September of 24 and have been trying to figure it out since then in a small portion of my total remit. And then in June of this year, our team underwent a major restructure where we lost half of the team either through personal decisions or business decisions. And I'm now the interim head of our digital marketing function. And so I have less time than I originally had to look at Domo than I did, but there's no one on my team who can own it. So it still squarely sits with me. And currently, I run all of our like major board decision type of metrics out of Power. BI, I'd love for more of the team metrics to fall within Domo so that we can give a clearer picture on sort of the industry specific and the content specific insights to our industry marketers, and subsequently the commercial team that they support. And right now that looks like social website Hubspot… type of data. We don't currently do a whole lot of email out of Hubspot, but we do run our website out of there and intend to have nurture's future facing. I know you can't really build a dashboard on a future facing data set, but it's something to keep a mind's eye to as we consider kind of the top of funnel to bottom of funnel experience. Oh.
Brian F: Sorry, real quick. So on Hubspot, you're running email out now and you plan on building a dashboard on say that again?
Virginia C: Yeah. So currently, Hubspot houses our website and our marketing automation. So we use both of their tools in that capacity, but we are not sending emails. Currently. We just have the ability to,
Brian F: okay. Do you also have like Google analytics or anything set up on your website?

Jordan K: I shaved my beard off and left it?
Signe P: Yeah, you look different from when I saw you on site like a week ago. Did you want me to share the slides or did you want to share them?
Jordan K: Either way, if you're going to kick it off, you can share them. Okay? And then I'll just talk to the ones with the numbers on it.
Signe P: Sweet. Bye Brian.
Jordan K: Morning, Signe, morning, Signe, and Jordan. Hey, man. How are you?
Dylan C: Too bad. I can't complain.
Jordan K: How are y'all doing this morning? Probably still Dave Ramsey saying and say better than I deserve. Bray, where are you looking it up? Salt lake city? Oh, nice. Hello?

Dylan C: Good. How are you?
Signe P: Good. Happy Friday's eve?
Dylan C: Yes, happy Friday's eve.

Jordan K: Thank you. Don't worry about it.
Dylan C: I'm in oshkosh Wisconsin.
Jordan K: Sweet. It's been a few years since I've been to Wisconsin, but it's a good place.
Dylan C: Not bad. How about yourself?
Jordan K: I'm in Utah, northern Utah.
Dylan C: Nice.
Signe P: Oshkosh, the gosh. Yep. Okay. I just had to, I'm sorry, I had to, and I know that you get that all the time.
Dylan C: It's fine.
Signe P: That just took me back to my childhood. I'm.
Dylan C: actually, not located here anymore.
Signe P: Oh, really? Wait, so they can't be called oshkosh anymore then. Can they?
Dylan C: They are, but no longer headquartered in oshkosh.
Signe P: I actually didn't know that they were still around.
Dylan C: Yeah, not as dominant as they were in that market, but still… around barely.
Signe P: That's funny. And then cheese, right? I love cheese. Yes, that's the only other thing I know about Wisconsin cheese and oshkosh.
Jordan K: You also have coler, Wisconsin, which I made a point to drive through one time. What was that coler, Wisconsin?
Dylan C: Oh, yeah. Yeah. That's a lot of fun.
Signe P: Is it spelled the same way your name is? Is that why?
Jordan K: Yeah.
Signe P: Oh, tricky family there or something or any relation?
Jordan K: Just, you know, the coler empire that I'll maybe get a 50 percent stake of one day?
Signe P: That's funny.
Dylan C: We just had our biggest event in oshkosh here, which is called eaa experimental aircraft. It's either association or I forgot, but it's the, for one week, we are the busiest airport in the world.
Signe P: Wow. So, is it like an air show?
Dylan C: Yes.
Signe P: Is it put on, through it's like through air force or anything like that? Or is it just?
Dylan C: No, eaa like eaa is like a permanent company here that, I mean, their sole job is to prep for that every year. Oh, cool. Because there's let's see. I forgot how many, like 20,000 people I think come here.
Jordan K: Or two cities?
Dylan C: The city's taken over most people leave.
Signe P: Oh, really?
Dylan C: That makes sense just because it gets so busy.
Signe P: That makes sense. My husband's air force. And so, anytime they have an air show out here, we always go. So, I'm sure that he would love to hear about the air show there.
Dylan C: Actually, it was 10, 10,000 aircrafts, 704,000 people. Oh,
Signe P: my gosh.
Dylan C: Yeah.
Signe P: I can see why it's a busy airport that's crazy. Where do you even put that many planes?
Dylan C: They.
Signe P: cycle them through?
Dylan C: Yeah, it's crazy. They allow like four planes to land at once on the runway. They have different color designations and you have to land on that color. Pretty close to each other. And then there's a whole like campsite kind of thing where you then park it.
Signe P: Man, can you imagine being the air director for that? Yeah, so stressful. Yeah.
Dylan C: About over 10,000, planes come in.
Signe P: Jeez. Wow. I think this is, Sam, is that you?

14146179745: Good afternoon. Doing okay?
Signe P: Good. Nice to meet you over. Zoom. My name is Signe, I'm the account rep, and I work with Bryant, who I think that you've met before. And we've been working with Dylan on all things Domo, so excited to talk with you about, renewal and what the future looks like. Any questions that you have before we jump on?
14146179745: None for me right now.
Signe P: Okay. I am going to be sharing a few slides. I don't know if you are able to see on your phone, but we can send them over to you as well afterwards to review… that'd. Be.
14146179745: Fine.
Signe P: Okay. I'm gonna just go ahead and share. So Dylan, I used the slide deck because I know that, you know, I, there's probably a little refresher that you might want. This just goes through what the consumption credits are, how they're used, how many different ways that we can determine how many credits you need going forward. So, I'll let you look at this at your own time, but I did want to make sure to add that for you.
Dylan C: Okay. Thank you.
Signe P: And there's quite a bit of them. So just scroll through them. And as we've talked Dylan, you know, the way that the retag works, you guys did some cleanup and so, you know, you started with like 2,000,000 plus legacy credits, and then the goal over the year was to be able to do a lot of cleanup and then also start some new projects. So, as we've calculated on our last call, you did enough cleanup where it got you to about 1,000,000 credits, which the, all we needed to do is make sure that you were under that 2,000,000 credit mark. So when the renewal comes, everything will be tagged as legacy, which is awesome. So there's not going to be any kind of overages or any calculation into what those credits would be. It will all be legacy. Does that make sense?
Dylan C: Yes.
Signe P: Okay. So all we have to talk about is going forward and that is where we've talked about like behavior changes, right?

Michael M: wow. Nice. Okay, good. I was going to say you're coming in for the holiday weekend. I was like, man, it's tough. Yeah, I was watching last night. I had some matches on late. I was catching up after watching the yankee game. I watched some of that. There you go. I bet I pulled it out. Yeah. So it's good. So, it was exciting. There's a lot of sports on yesterday, little league world series. You had baseball. So now football on top of it. So, yeah.
Kevin W: College.
William D: Football started.
Michael M: college. Yeah. Did college start last week next week? Yeah.
Kevin W: There was a game in ireland?
Michael M: Oh, really?
Kevin W: Yeah. Iowa state and Kansas state. Yeah. Okay.
Michael M: And then the pros will start and that'll be it so busy. So, all right. I guess we could start. Yeah. So one thing I just wanted to invite, wanted to, you know, introduce you to Jeff hurd who's going. He'll kind of run the renewal for procurement this year. Jeff's not new to. He's new to procurement but not new to ups. He's been in the finance function for many years. So he just came aboard and started working with us early in the year. So helping us out with software contracts. So, right. So you'll be in good hands with Jeff. So I gave him a little bit of the low down, but I guess as I was saying before, Jill Odell gave me some marching orders. You know, she had some specifics, she wanted us to look at a three year deal. I could kind of just lay out, give you some ideas of what she was looking at. Yeah, she wanted to look at a three year deal. She also, you know, of course, we love termination for convenience, but she wanted some sort of an out clause termination for convenience in… the deal… carryover credits. So, right, if you don't use them, you don't lose them if you don't use them. So some sort of carryover credits in there, yeah.
Kevin W: Jill and I spoke last week so I've talked to her, yeah, I gave her a couple different options so we can't do carryover credits for what we've been doing. So when we do three year deals, they're three year deals. So there's not a termination for convenience on that. You get basically risk removal. Obviously, the more term you take any pricing increases, you're locked in for that price. That's part of why, you know, most customers take on three five year deals. They're really, you know, locking in. And so what we do in relation to that as well as we're giving customers also insurances of… giving them overage caps. So like this year from… the execution credits… they're currently trending towards the end of the year being over by about 20,000 credits. And so moving forward, what we wanted to do is get this negotiated three year deal negotiated. We would extend some courtesy credits till the end of the year. So there aren't any overages that are charged to you guys in exchange for getting this negotiated earlier. In addition, instead of the, carryover, right? What we're going to do is we're going to extend those caps out annually, right? So they'll be in the proposal. If you go over, say, you know, we extended a cap and say it's you know, 100,000 credits max that you could go over even if you use 200,000 or 300,000 each year. We're going to cap it at a certain amount so that your risk exposure again is completely limited. And we're basically saying, hey, you're giving us a three year deal? We're taking the risk out of a no pricing increases, but also we're taking the risk out of, hey, we go out, we try a few things. We happen to go over like we did this year, my exposure is completely covered. I'm not going to be extended anything beyond and that amount. And even if you go over that amount and then you renew what happens is then it triggers for the subsequent years, those credits automatically being added to the out years. So it allows you to say, okay, all right. We went over, we're going to have to budget for that for the next couple of years, but at least we know what that's going to be and it's not a middle of the year. Oh, my God. I kind of come up with budgets, right? Hey, we know we went over, we're going to continue to go over and we're going to go ahead and I'm going to bank that into next year's. Contract?

William W: Mr. Ted.
Ted S: Hey, will, how you doing today?
William W: I'm not doing too bad, just recovering from a little bit of a cough, but we're not in bad shape.
Ted S: Yeah, there's all sorts of funk going around. It seems like here at least.
William W: It's crazy man. You got kids Ted?
Ted S: No, I don't so, just everybody that has them though, with school starting up, I'm sure makes a big impact.
William W: That's it. Man. That's it. My kid started kindergarten about a month and a half ago, and I think he's already gotten sick three different times. Oh.
Ted S: Geez.
William W: I'm getting used to it man.
Ted S: You're building up that immune system for the long haul though. I.
William W: hope so. I hope so for sure. I'm going to be a tank by the time all this is over.
Ted S: Yeah.
William W: Well, I think the… I think this will probably be a pretty short one.
Ted S: Okay. That's fine with me. I got things going on. So, yeah, I know you mentioned you were working a lot on just the functionality side as far as getting the response time and getting the just wiring built out versus any changes in functionality, but I guess I'll let you go.
William W: Yeah, that's really, there's two things that I'm actually going to, otherwise, I would have reached out to you and said like, hey, let's hold off.
Ted S: So,
William W: there's two things that I want to make sure that I'm on the same page because choosing one way or the other is a pretty decent shift.
Ted S: So, I.
William W: want to confirm at one point, we had said that when a packet comes in. So I'll walk you through a hypothetical. Let's say these are assigned packets and we don't have any in here. Oh, let me refresh this. We don't have any in here that are coming out of the assignment like these are all coming out of the ERP, except for maybe this one might be rehydrating. So, anyways.
Ted S: Let's.
William W: say we go to show assigned over here?
Ted S: I'm.
William W: there's some things that I need to work on. I wanted to make sure that like this for instance. So this is assigned to Lauren.
Ted S: If.
William W: I were to uncheck this. Let's say or if I was to… yeah, let's just say that. So let's say I unchecked her or him and then I assign these and Qlik assign to welders. Now, I'm working on this. So it'll break the Gantt right now. Would we want, would we want the unassignment of that and the reassignment or the shift of assignment to override what you're seeing, in… this arena… or is there anywhere where you look to see who is assigned to things, right? This one, I went over here?
Ted S: Yeah. I mean in Domo currently, not, it will be useful to have that. So, yeah, what you're seeing there is just there's a operation, they clock into it. So there's like a labor ticket. So for each operation, you can assign work or I guess just allocate work to that job. And so all that's showing is who has clocked into that operations and who's claimed time against that standard hours that we have available for that work to be done?
William W: Got it. So we would.
Ted S: Long term, yes, I think we'll want to pull allocations and have reports generated off of it. And I think I would do want it to be live. So as soon as you make the change, we would see it visibly change on the Gantt chart… but I don't know if that.
William W: Answers the question. Perfectly. Okay. And then a follow up question, there's two places where I see names populate there's lastclockop. And then lastemployeeclockedpart.
Ted S: so each part can have as many operations as necessary to make that piece or make that assembly. And so, I think lastclockoperation is for that given operation. So for that B4 hundred work center who clocked into that last, but there's a chance where, okay, that operation is now complete. And there's a secondary operation following it, the lastoperation or lastemployeeclockedpart is just saying has somebody actually worked on that piece? But maybe the next operation for it, it's only valuable just because sometimes traceability of parts throughout the shop. I just want to know hey, who was the last person who worked on it? And so by part, it's looking at all of the operations within that item. But the lastoperation the lastclockop is just for that given operation… the B4 hundred operation in this case.
William W: Got it. Okay. Am I correct in believing that the names that show up on those aren't always welders. They could be people from other places where that?
Ted S: Correct. Yes, particularly for the part the op should be consistent, just there's there are chances where we have somebody who's training and maybe not be classified as a welder quite yet, and they're clocking into it or they inadvertently clocked into the operation. But the part one for sure could be a wide variety of employees. Okay?
William W: Yeah, that's what I need to know. I need to check against because what I'm trying to do is I'm trying to say like, hey, if I look into like these pre assigned ones like neptune filters was assigned in the ERP. So when I go in here, I got this to properly show. I also got where you had said, hey, let's push the assigned people to the top of the list. So that's working. Now, what I'm trying to sort out is when it comes in assigned already, so like this, Jerry vroman, is a great example. Is that a welder? No?
Ted S: So, yeah, I guess I don't yeah.
William W: Dude. All right.
Ted S: Yeah. I guess I'm curious, how is that, if that's not just manually selected within the system, how is that knowing? Is that, is that using that last operation, last clock? Top? Yeah.
William W: So we, okay. What, what we have is it, it's got like it's rolling up on a packet or a job level. And then it's like, hey, whoever has, whoever's names we have in here, let's roll them up as a concatenated list here. Essentially. And so, what I need to do is essentially, instead of selected, I need to say like who's clock time?

They highlighted the need for a comprehensive data dictionary to align metric calculations across departments and ensure consistent reporting, as well as the importance of a robust certification process to maintain data integrity and visibility. The team agreed to prepare a roadmap and schedule a follow-up working session to address the identified issues and move the project forward.","Ivan S: hey, Kevin. Hey, Felicia.
Kevin H: Hello Ivan?
Felicia M: Doing well. Thank you. How are you?
Ivan S: Good. Kevin, did you have a chance to complete the KPI documentation?
Kevin H: So, it is actually not completed, but I am going to share what I have with you guys.
Ivan S: Okay. Yeah. We can definitely just go over what you have so far if that's what you want to have as the meeting agenda for today?
Kevin H: Let me get that shared out with you guys shortly? All right. So, I'm sharing this with Scott, Jenna and Ivan. I don't think anyone else needs access, but if they do just let me know and I'll add them as well. Okay. You guys should have access to it. It is titled 20 24 to 25 KPI dashboard metrics only. So I've stripped out kind of most of the actual tracking… of the KPIs themselves in this. I started to define what is the KPI? What is the metric that we're capturing with that KPI? What is the source system? And then any additional notes? I still have quite a bit to work through. I was actually out Thursday and Friday last week and I think some of these are just going to require me getting with every single department and just getting some of that follow up information. And then also for, I think last time I spoke a little bit to this a lot of our KPIs at the moment, for some departments are very, either subjective or not really trackable with data. I think the biggest example of this is, let me double check. I… think I saw this mostly in our Hoy center where they have things like, hey, achieve this quality award… maintaining certain.
Ivan S: Hey, Kevin, I don't think we've gotten the KPI documentation. I haven't seen it, you.
Kevin H: Didn't get that in your email?
Ivan S: No, I don't think so.
Kevin H: Okay. Let me double check. Okay. So I, you guys should have gotten an email, but I'll also copy and paste the link into the zoom chat as well.
Scott T: Well, it's on Google drive, yes.
Kevin H: And Brooklyn and Felicia, you guys should also have access to the document as well.
Felicia M: Yes, thank you.
Kevin H: And if you guys are having any trouble accessing I see Scott's in there, but I can also share this out.
Jenna H: Yeah, that's perfect. For some reason. It's not taking my Google password stuff right now. So this is good too. I'll figure out how to get in there later.
Kevin H: So, yeah, I started separating this out by department. But essentially our original KPI sheet is just kind of a single pane of glass with all of our departments kind of listed out. And the only change I made is I just added a sheet for each department just to separate it out a little bit. Now, a lot of this is going to be currently right now the source system for a lot of these metrics especially anything finance related, but also anything marketing related. A lot of these are going to be currently housed in spreadsheets… full transparency. We are going through a, I guess I'll call it a systems audit in our accounting department where they're auditing all of the various systems they have and trying to get those spreadsheets consolidated back into the source systems. But for now, anything finance related that's going to be all populated by spreadsheets. And then again, our marketing stats are also going to be coming from spreadsheets as well as far as systems that we already have in Domo today, I know we have our ukg data populating fairly well. Mostly right now, our ukg data is just kind of base employee data, but we also have turnover and headcount metrics as well. Wecare connect. This is going to be a platform that is across all of our KPIs. I have not looked into this in. I'll say the last let's call it eight months… but at the time I looked into it, they did not have any type of API access. I'm hoping this changed because their automated or email reporting is not great either. But let me actually highlight these orange so I can review for.
Scott T: Is that just wecareconnect org? Is that the right? Yes. Okay.
Kevin H: Yeah, that is the one. Yep. Okay. And it does… look like they have gone under some modifications. So I will check API access there. Like when I say a lot of our KPIs are subjective. A lot of these HR ones are, you know, implementation or some type of training opportunities, just kind of random things like that I don't believe is captured in any system… draft and alternate performance evaluation structure. Like these things are a little bit more subjective. We care, oh, no, this is monitoring… our it KPIs. Again, a lot of this is a lot of the financials are going to be in accounting spreadsheets, which I need to schedule time with our accounting department and kind of figure out what that landscape looks like because I highly doubt there is a single spreadsheet for some of these metrics, but Freshdesk, this is also a system that we currently have in Domo that I will start marking in green.
Jenna H: So the green ones are going to be, is coming into Domo already?
Kevin H: Yes, these are already populating to Domo, the yellow, I need to follow up with the department and get a little bit more information on what exactly it is, either what exactly the source system is, or what exactly the metric is that they're pulling in the orange are platforms that I'm sure this is where the data is coming from, but I'm not 100 percent sure whether or not there's API access or what type of data egress we have from those systems. These are going to be all accounting.
Scott T: And what system does your accounting department use? I mean, obviously, they're putting things data into spreadsheets, but what do they use?
Kevin H: So that's a good question. So they actually, I believe… the audit for their systems is ongoing. I believe they have about 20 different systems right now that they are spreading their data across and that should be consolidated sometime at either the start of the fiscal year, which for us is in October or by the end of the calendar year, we're looking to have some of those systems kind of consolidated and more streamlined. But for right now, I think our best recourse while they go through their audit is just to pull the data from the spreadsheets the",Consumption Pricing Model,72964.57,Corporate,WCBAY.COM,3,Healthcare & Health Services,415,$50M to <$100M,Upsell,Blank,2: Determine Needs,Eric Smith,2025-12-12,2025-03-24,2025-03-24,,,,,,0015000000uWr4mAAC

Ankit S: Hey, Jonathan. How you doing?
Sharr J: Doing well. How are you? Good to see you man?
Ankit S: Good to see you too. How was your long weekend?
Sharr J: You know, my long weekend was a short weekend. So, I'm in an mba program, an executive format. So it's weekends. So approximately like it's 20 weekends and then six weeks baked in. And so like last weekend was one of our class weekends. So, Friday, Saturday, Sunday, I was just in school all day. So I had Monday, I got back really late. I go to DC from Connecticut and I got back. Oh, wow. I got back late Sunday night. So I had Monday with my family. It was nice.
Ankit S: Wow. I didn't.
Sharr J: do much. We went apple picking like first, you know, my kids really wanted to go apple picking. I was like that's great. Let's do that.
Ankit S: Yeah. Well, it was good up here over the weekend. It was great. Beautiful, honestly.
Sharr J: Where are you again? Ankit?
Ankit S: I'm in Delaware, but I was actually in jersey for like a chunk of the weekend and the weather was just great. It was like mid seventies. I'm sure it was the same case for you. What I meant to ask was, did you by any chance? Take the bullet train? Not the bullet train, but the high speed train with amtrak that they just put up.
Sharr J: Did I take the train? I was on the second ever southbound train. Have you been on it yet?
Ankit S: No, I haven't, can.
Sharr J: We cut away for a second. Sure. Okay. It was so cool. I'm like a train enthusiast. I live in old Sabre, Connecticut. The train stops. So, the regional stops where I am… but we really leverage the train hard. When I go to DC, I just go to new haven and get the acela from new haven. I was thrilled. I've been waiting.
Ankit S: It's about time, right?
Sharr J: So, here's a couple of cool things. They had goodie bags for all the passengers. I gave most of it to my kids. You got an Avelia liberty pin. You got a sticker, an Avelia, liberty sugar cookie, a bag of acela blend, coffee, and a certificate that you were on the first day.
Ankit S: That's so cool.
Sharr J: And this is the coolest part. This is the coolest part and then we can get back to business. It's like Harry potter. There is someone who goes up and down the train with a cart.
Ankit S: Oh, that's amazing. And.
Sharr J: they were giving away free drinks for the inaugural ride. And then like ongoing like that's the thing like you're sitting in your seat, you want, hey, you want a glass of wine, great person comes by with a drink cart and, you know, a glass of pinot please?
Ankit S: That's amazing. And I imagine there's like similar to the amtrak where there's like bars or snack stations or whatever like in one like car on the train as well.
Sharr J: Yeah. And the cafe, it's interesting. The cafe car like in some ways, it's super modern and super neat and different. On the other hand, you can tell the design is very much a nod to the original acela, yeah. And the cafe car is laid out very similarly except they have like a grab and go area. It's like all cold stuff, all cold and non alcoholic. You just grab. And there's it's like self checkout at the grocery store. Yeah, it's great. I'm like, oh, I got it. That falafel sandwich looks great. I'll grab one of those and then obviously, if you want, if you need something that they like, they warm up or it's alcohol, you like walk over the counter and they attend it. But, yeah.
Ankit S: I.
Sharr J: love that grab and go. I thought it was a super like a super like a really super cool feature.
Ankit S: Yeah… was, how long was it from Connecticut to DC? Was it under two hours?
Sharr J: No. So, it, it's actually slower.
Ankit S: Oh, really? So.
Sharr J: Let me, let me take that back schedule wise. It's essentially the same. I actually think it's like a minute or two slower. If you look at the timetable they were. I think they were having some issues and they just didn't want to be too over about it. Just overhearing people at every, like overhearing attendants at every stop. We were like pretty well delayed like usually it's a little under five hours like four or 45, from new haven. Yeah. And it's about like four from stanford Connecticut. But, yeah, this was, that… train schedule's getting in at like 1,115. I don't think we got in until close to midnight. Oh, wow. But it was fine. It was still really fun. Yeah. And it was really cool to be a part of it. And I'm thrilled to ride it again when I go back to DC in a few weeks, yeah.
Ankit S: And, I'm sure because it just kicked off like, I, I've heard they're not running things at full speed for some time because.
Sharr J: They.
Ankit S: kind of just want to get, you know, maintenance and safety locked down before they kind of like ramp it up to like its potential top speed, which they probably won't even like, I think it was like 150 Miles per hour is what it tops out at, but they're probably going to average around like 120, something like that, right? Right. Well, if you last thing, I'll leave this here, if you haven't been to Japan, the bullet trains, you will love it's. Awesome. It's very cool.
Sharr J: So, my, we've our own fault. We've created these like food snobs, and like kids with travel bugs with our three children, especially my youngest. It's all he talks about. He's even we have a duolingo family subscription and a pimsleur language subscription. He's like learning Japanese.
Ankit S: Oh, very cool.
Sharr J: Our next vacation should be Japan. I'm like, hey, do you know how much money it cost me to take you all to Italy last year? Okay?

Madison H: If that's useful. Yeah, that would be wonderful.
Simon G: I'm Simon, I run programmatic and data operations. So, everyday health group, large media business. We are part of ziff davis a nasdaq public company. So, everyday health group is a division of that. Although we work very closely with our ziff davis colleagues, we kind of operate separately. Everyday health group has then got three divisions within it. We've got a consumer health division focused on everyday health, consumer health information. So that is everydayhealth. Com. We've got lose it for calorie tracking, migraine, again for migraine information, diabetes daily. We have the scim which is a, you know, women's newsletter that we recently acquired. We've got partnerships with the Cleveland clinic and the mayo clinic to monetize their websites. We have what we call our pregnancy and parenting division, which is what to expect baby center, you know, sites and apps for that. And then we have what we call our professional division, which is healthcare professional information. Medpage today is a flagship of that. But then there's also continuing medical education and health… recruiting sites. So that's kind of like the lay of the land. So, you know, I'm focused on programmatic monetization along with data operations and I'll pass it over to Veronica.
Veronica G: Awesome. So I fit in on the data operations side. So I spend almost all of my time in Domo, getting the reporting also from our ad servers into adgestor into Domo and working with stakeholders on how we'd like to surface that information mostly using apps and dashboards.
Chris D: Awesome.
Veronica G: Go ahead. Bharath.
Bharath R: Hi, I'm Bharath. So I'm director of analytics at the bi department in everyday health. So I work like, you know, creating reports, dashboards, pulling all the data together from our various sources and then providing meaningful information to our stakeholders.

I'm Madi, humble, my email says Madison, but feel free to call me Madi. I've been with Domo for a little over seven years, now been in a few different roles, had the opportunity to work with Neil in the past, but excited now we these kind of internal shifts. What it does is now aligns all of our accounts with the same person. So now Neil and I work together on everything. So it's pretty exciting because we get really fluid in how we're going to be working with you all. And hopefully it translates into some really good stuff for your team. I'm located out in North Carolina. And yeah, I think that's about me. I do have some questions getting the lay of the land. But before I jump in, there, is there anything that's pressing anything that you guys have come across recently that you need us to address before we jump into kind of my, you know, curiosity here?
Simon G: I think the biggest thing is the change in the consumption model which is for us is happening in from, you know, the legacy to move stuff to the legacy credits is happening the end of November. So we are just making sure we are prepared for that. That's kind of been top of mind for us.
Neil M: And, I know the last time we talked Simon, Veronica, we, there was, I think some efforts, a lot of efforts going into making sure that you were ready for that.

Benjamin P: Linh, I know it's been, and I know we have a few other people maybe joining but it's been a couple of weeks since we've had a chance to sync with you. So I'm glad that you're able to be here today. I don't know how much the team has shared with you, but Michelle and Sabrina have done an excellent job getting us access to the mip system as test users in the test environment. Shane was able to test the API connection with mip successfully. And so we were able to successfully test that connection. And we believe those endpoints will really… help us to automatically write these ap invoices back to your system. We also from the previous call, we demonstrated the AI features within demo that we'll use to automatically extract the data that we'll need from the invoices and populate them in a form. Our team is currently working on the user interface for that form and building this out so that your team can start testing it in the near future. One of the main objectives of today's call is to go through the roadmap and the proposal. This is obviously a non paid engagement. These are free resources to you. But as part of this adoption program, we do put together proposals for the use cases that we're building for you just to ensure that we are aligned on our objectives and the requirements. And just a verbal approval from you guys on that proposal is all that we need to move forward with building this out. And so that's what Vince is on the call for. He's going to walk us through this proposal that we've put together for this first use case. We did not put a proposal together for the other two use cases that we've discussed, the financial dashboard, and the payroll… allocation use case. We didn't put together one for that yet because I know our main focus has been on this ap automation piece. And so we'll just go over that today. And if you have any questions, feel free to let us know. But just a verbal approval on your side is all that we need to get acceptance for that proposal so that we can continue to move forward. Does that sound good?
Linh T: Yeah, yes. And then I will give you some update that Michelle shared with me yesterday. Also, we do have the code from our HR mip vendor for that same not same but similar automation that they're gonna push the automate invoice and automate bank feed to our system. So I just want to let you know that we have all the vendor send out the code for the almost similar function that we need to our system right now. Okay?
Benjamin P: Okay. So the bank feed is automated into your ap system. Now? Is that what you're saying?
Linh T: No, we don't have it right now that's what we need. That's why we're looking for solution that's why we talk to you, Domo. We talk to you direct mip, our accounting system, and we talk to other people. I told you last time we talked with bill. Com also, but we got some pricing back from our mip. So now we're going to see what your proposal and we're going to compare all the proposals we got and then we will find the best one.
Benjamin P: Yep. Yeah. So Michelle did mention that on the last call about the automating the process of the bank feed into your system. And so we can certainly continue having that discussion in parallel with what we're building out for the ap automation piece. And so we can certainly put together a proposal for that after we've had a chance to test and work with you more closely on getting that integration made. I think that that's separate from what we're trying to do with automating the ap invoice parsing, correct?
Linh T: I think that's similar. That's why I want to see what you propose right now. Sabrina here, she over the ap and that's what we try to see what the difference between what you say you can do versus mip.
Benjamin P: Okay. So yeah. So what we're the proposal that Vince is going to show here in a second. The approach is that the plan is to drag and drop the PDFS into Domo. The PDFS of the invoices, Domo will automatically parse those out, write them into a form, have the user review it, add any additional information that they want, they Qlik submit and it writes back to your ap system. So this is, this doesn't include the bank feed. The bank feed just came up on the last call. So the entire time we've been working through this automated invoice processing that wasn't brought up until most recently. So if that needs to be in addition to or added to this roadmap or this proposal for the automated invoice processing, we can certainly add that as a component. But that's not going to be in Vince's proposal today because that was just brought up recently.
Vince W: So why don't? I, hopefully you guys can hear me why don't, I walk you guys through this. And as Ben mentioned before, this is more of formality, I think the work has already started but we want to just make sure we have the documentation. But as Ben said before, this is a non paid engagement. So there won't be any costs more of a, you know, you want to proceed. I'll send this to you via email afterwards so you can go through it. But I'll just kind of hit the high level pieces. So as Ben mentioned before, we're going to focus really on this automated invoice processing with OCR.
Benjamin P: And Vince, can I just interrupt for just a second? Sure. I'm sorry, but there's no implementation or services cost associated with this. There's obviously going to be cost associated with running this within your demo environment.

They explored ways to retrieve application data and analyze the opportunity stage progression to provide the desired insights, with Bellamy expressing interest in understanding the quality of hires based on lead sources and tying that to employee performance data.","Bellamy Y: hey, good morning, Ben.
Benjamin P: Hi Bellamy. How are you?
Bellamy Y: Good. Happy Friday.
Benjamin P: Yes, happy Friday. You got any plans for the weekend?
Bellamy Y: Gonna go to the nifty fifties tonight… and I'm gonna go see my partner's, parents tomorrow. I believe we had something else on Sunday, but I'm not too sure now. How about you?
Benjamin P: Gotcha. Well, I really need to, I really need to fix the guest. I say it's the guest bathroom. It's really, we've got two bathrooms. So we've got our bathroom, my wife and I, our bathroom, and then the kids, their bathroom, which is the bathroom that everybody else uses. If we have any company over. I had to about three weeks ago. I noticed that we had a water leak and there was mold in the wall and so I had to mold and mildew in the wall. And so I had to rip, I ripped out like half of the drywall in the bathroom and I took out all the insulation in there. And so I've removed all the mold but now it's just like all the walls are torn apart and it's just sitting there. And so I've got to, at some point, I've got to fix that. It's not hurting anything for it to be the way it is, but I do have to fix it and I just haven't had time to. So I may be working on that tomorrow.
Bellamy Y: Oh, that sounds like a intense… project.
Benjamin P: Yeah, I don't think it's going to be too bad. I mean, it's not a lot of drywall and it's not a lot of insulation that you just on one.
Bellamy Y: Wall. Oh good. It wasn't.
Benjamin P: like the whole bathroom or anything. But it did, like, so my closet and my bedroom shares a wall with that bathroom. And so it actually, the water… got on the carpet in my closet. And so I had to rip the carpet out. And so, it's not just the bathroom. It's actually, there's a hole in my closet now where I had to take out some of the drywall in there. And so I've got to do both sides. And then I have to put the carpet back down. So it's going to be a project. I think I can probably get it done in a day, maybe probably won't get the painting done tomorrow. But if I can get the drywall and the insulation up, we'll be good.
Bellamy Y: Well, good luck there. And, can't wait to hear about it on Monday, Ben. I took a look at the lever data and I was trying to understand… which columns I need to use for a majority of the KPIs. I mean, there's only about like one or two KPIs that I can create right now with this current set of data. And, there's no way for me to… grab. So, like I do think that two main data set that we're going to need to use is opportunities. And, posting I believe is what it was called. It was the first two data sets, postings is all the open roles and opportunities I believe is all the applicants, all the leads. And so what we do need?
Benjamin P: I can hear you now. Sorry, you, your, voice went out for like 30 seconds and I couldn't hear anything.
Bellamy Y: Oh, Jesus. What did you hear so far?
Benjamin P: You were, you had started talking about the lever data and said that the two main ones that you needed were opportunities and, and postings.
Bellamy Y: Postings. Yeah. So those two, I believe is going to be the main ones like source sure, whatever, but I can't really imagine that source being used. Well, either way. Like those source… opportunities posting, they all have like pieces of information, but for us to get all the rest of the KPI, they need to be able to connect. But I don't see any unique ids or natural keys or relational keys between those tables at all, and I can't join them.
Benjamin P: All right. So, let's just look at, give me, let's just, I think we're just going to have to go one KPI at a time and sort of look at what data that we need. And then I can figure out how to make the data join together. So, do you have one off the top of your head or do you want me to pull up that Microsoft word document or do you have one that you want to?
Bellamy Y: Yeah, I do have one on top of my head. Like for example, right now opportunities, you see this, these people applying in, you know, whether this lead was added manually or it came from, indeed or whatever from the sources table, sources column. There's also origin column, which I think it says the same stuff. But the biggest thing here right now is I need to be able to know which posting this was for each line item, which, where did they apply?
Benjamin P: Okay. So, yeah. So this is the opportunity and then we have an opportunity id here. And then this is the headline for the opportunity. And so let's… see followers, location applications. Okay? So it looks like it tells us the headline… but we want to know the exact, like what was the actual role, correct?
Bellamy Y: Correct. Yeah, there's got to be a, there's. Got to be let's.
Benjamin P: Get a lever API… and… Would it not be postings?
Bellamy Y: It will be postings?
Benjamin P: Yeah. So if we go to postings, it has the salary range, the owner of the postings, the hiring manager. So this is the description of the posting, And we want to know like, the role?
Bellamy Y: Either the posting id, yeah.
Benjamin P: Or?
Bellamy Y: Wait, what does this say text?
Benjamin P: We have, we have id, we… have this text here, which is, looks like this might.
Bellamy Y: Be, so that, that's got to be the posting name. Yeah. Title, how do we connect this to the opportunity?
Benjamin P: Alright. So, let's go to whoop. Wait, what… and then we go to opportunities. Do we have posting there? Isn't posting? Let's see. I wonder if it's in applications? I wonder if we're going to have to pull in applications. Let's see… applications, retrieve an application. It has an id, an opportunity id. So that's what we need. We need to pull in the applications. And then this posting will join to the applications using the I'm sorry, the opportunities will join to the applications by the application id. And then the application will join to the posting because the application has the opportunity. Okay? Does it, well, hang on now, does it have posting? Yeah, posting. Yeah. So we have posting id and we have opportunity id, and then the application is what joins them together.

Daniel P: I'm doing well, Simon, how are you, man?
Simon N: So good. I had a good weekend.
Daniel P: Excellent, dude. Excellent.
Simon N: What about you? Anything notable?
Daniel P: Not really rode around in one wheel, saw the aggies win, hung out with a girlfriend. It was good, dude. It was good but nothing like super notable.
Simon N: Nice. Okay. So you're an aggies fan?
Daniel P: Oh, absolutely. Man.
Simon N: Is that where you went? Yeah. Okay.
Daniel P: Yeah, but I mean, we beat Utah state. So, it's not like anything, you know, it's not like a commendable win basically.
Simon N: They all count man.
Daniel P: Yeah, but they always do this first three games. It's like great. And then we actually go against like a tough opponent, and then we just crash and burn. So, you know, I've been living the aggie life for like the last geez… 20 years. So, I'm no stranger. I'm no stranger to disappointment. Basically. It has made me tough.
Simon N: Yep calloused fan. I went to Oregon state and my beavers got whacked by Fresno state which was a pretty bad loss for us at home this week. So, I wish I could have those three hours back.
Daniel P: Oh, no, it's the worst. It's the worst whenever you're just like, ah, okay.
Simon N: And then I watched a little bit of NFL yesterday and I was like, it's such a better product because it's so sloppy and like it was just so many panels. It was just like a mess. So, maybe I'll get off easy this year and I can just check out after our first few games.
Daniel P: Yeah, that makes sense. That makes sense. I don't have much to talk about other than I guess projects that we're doing right now.
Simon N: Yeah. I wanted to get an update on the kind of emailed summary agent with the budget versus actual spending.
Daniel P: Oh, that's cool. It's cool.
Simon N: Okay, cool. Are you progressing with that? Like, are you applying PDP? I don't know if that's something you discussed about, but how's it going?
Daniel P: We're not applying PDP because mainly we kind of shifted to other, I guess… more pressing projects that was more like a little side pet thing. So we haven't applied PDP to it. I think we're going to want to do the same thing to another dashboard that we have for SDRS. But we're trying to figure out like, okay, what kind of questions do we want this like the AI agent to actually answer? You know, what's going to be beneficial as far as that goes. But I think one of our, one of my biggest goals right now is just automate as much as possible like user access management and then user creation. So we're actually having to do a combination of both workflows and scripts because a lot of the tasks that we want to do aren't available in workflows, but they are available through like the demo like API from what we saw in like the documentation. Now, as far as feature requests, it'd be cool if it was in workflows because then I can have some of my like… lower tech guys actually do that. And that's actually been wonderful for workflows. Is that, you know, I can use, my parts of my team that knows how to write like python or anything else, to harder things. And then do have my not as technical guys work on using… workflows. But yeah, basically effectively what we want to do, we want to open Domo to more people, but we can't really do that until we get some sort of automatic user access management just because people's titles, change positions, change and we just want the ability to not have to worry about that especially since we're a small team, you know, user access management can, it can be like a unwieldy time consuming thing.
Simon N: Yeah, yeah. I know, definitely governance, I mean, you guys are thinking about it the right way, right? So important to have some automation there and just check some balances, but yeah, you're definitely on the right track with the scripts and workflows. And I've definitely heard that from other customers as well, kind of combining, hey, can we, you know, scripting just natively in workflows? I know that's on the roadmap as you've seen with AI task tile like they're always, you know, pushing ahead on the product development workflows. So, yeah, I wouldn't be surprised if that's something that pops out here before the end of the year. Cool. But that's awesome to hear on the user management. What would this SDR dashboard look like? And I'm assuming that's just right top of the funnel metrics that like, you know, outbound activities at conversions, kind of how does reputation measure their SDR activity?
Daniel P: So it's specifically right now just tracking call volume from our call volume tracking app. What we want to turn it into is effectively get more interaction between that and the opportunities that we create in Salesforce. But right now, their biggest thing that they wanted to do was just get visibility. I mean, they're pretty kind of low on the maturity level of just analytics. You know, they can pull basic stuff from their, they can still pull basic stuff from their… from the transactional system. But they wanted something that could be like easily accessible by, all the SDRS so that they can kind of see like, okay, this is what happened last week or this is what happened?
Simon N: And how many SDRS?
Daniel P: We have like 20.
Simon N: Okay. And is that split new logo and current customer?
Daniel P: It's split between sales territory, which so the SDRS are just strictly new logo. Okay? Our csms just strictly work, all the existing customer stuff. So SDRS is just new logo and they're split up based on like territory. So basically like mid market enterprise, eu, or North America kind of stuff. So it's not super complex of a of a division.
Simon N: I don't know that's interesting. And so it sounds like their performance is tied back to optis, and Salesforce. Yeah, at a certain point.
Daniel P: Basically meetings created. Okay. Well, well, that's like the ultimate, that's like the ultimate like end goal. One of the things that they didn't have visibility is like, hey, you know, what is our, like conversion rate of like how many calls do we have to make in order to get a conversation?

Hrithvikvijay L: Up here.
Shane W: Because one of the things that, you… know, it's hard for me coming in and just like starting from… kind… of looking at something that's already been built because we have, you know.
Hrithvikvijay L: Let's see if I can pull the right one. Yeah, that's not right. We.
Shane W: Have so many new features in some of our data in our magic ETL that wasn't there in any of like the adrenaline stuff like that and,
William M: when we started adrenaline wasn't there, so.
Shane W: Yeah, exactly. You guys have been around for a long time. I know that you guys have been, been doing that for a while, but, anyways, so I've been, I've started building this out. And, one of the things that I wanted to do was understand. The, the… what you guys were doing, in some of these steps because that will help me to be able to know like, what data we can bring in like how much data we need to bring in. And if there's a way that we could write it more efficiently than, what we have, like I could take what you guys have written, and kind of parse it out. But then, I was doing this and I thought, you know, what there's gotta be, if I know what we're trying to do, maybe there's we can skip some steps and make things a little bit easier. So, what I wanted to do is just kind of look at this one. This is the let.
Hrithvikvijay L: Me pull it up.
Shane W: It's the rebates and allowance. This, this one, the rebates and allowance was the one I was working on, right? So, I mean, this is a huge input data set. I don't think it's processing everything every time, but this is the one I was trying to kind of do because you're saying it fails. You know, it's kind of inconsistent in how it runs. I thought, okay, this may be a good one to do.
William M: If you look at the history, you can see it's pretty spotty. Yeah.
Shane W: So, what I wanted to do is see if we could make it be like a little bit more consistent in its timing and when it runs or in completing the… so one… of the things that I was wondering, you know, we're kind of looking at these start and end dates for these different segments and I just was wondering, you know, in the end, what is the, tell me a little bit about the output of this data flow?
William M: This is when you need Wayne on here because he remembers what all the segments are. Okay? And the cost centers?
Shane W: Yeah. But this is, so this is going back and looking at every… month?
William M: Or,
Shane W: you know, going back to 2015 and then the segment number and then getting the… rebate percent, I guess, or, you know, each of these different fields for, you know, doing a calculation and I was just wondering, is this calculation like just for the month or is it supposed to be looking back? X?
William M: Amount?
Shane W: Of time, things… like that? I'm just wondering if you have any, yeah, it's.
William M: going to be at the period level? Okay? I guess period and segment? I know like segment is like dell sbu slab… sbu.
Shane W: Yeah. I mean, I guess I'm not so worried about like the meaning of these, but more of like, I guess like because when I'm looking at this, it's like these like HSC start and end, it's like we're looking for this data between the start and the end for like HSC?
William M: Yeah. Hcs is going to be home center.
Shane W: Home center. Okay? And then this is distributors.
William M: Distributor. Yeah.
Shane W: Oh, and we're looking at this, the date range. So like the home centers. So we're looking back basically a year, and then the distributors, we're looking back five months. And then the SSC… is looking back two months. Is that correct? Like those are the time periods that we're looking at for those discounts?
William M: That sounds right. Okay. And I can't remember why on the discounts, we're looking back those periods because, you know, it's been a while since we were doing this.
Shane W: Yeah, no, I totally get it. I just wanted to make sure that I was understanding that we had different windows that we were looking at for these different groupings. But so, yeah, I can, that makes sense. Now. Is it, it's the periods and not days that we care about, right?
William M: Right. Yeah. It's doing the calculation on the fiscal calendar, not on the calendar.
Shane W: Got it. Yeah, that makes sense. And.
William M: It drives me crazy when people call it fiscal month, it should be fiscal period, but that's just a pet peeve.
Shane W: Yeah, that's good to know. I'll call it fiscal period. I'll try to.
William M: Everybody at Dao calls it fiscal month. So that's fine. It's just, it's not the month, you know, you can't refer to fiscal period, February.
Shane W: And is your fiscal month? Is it's not, it's… like starts on like a Monday, first Monday of the quarter of the month. Is that how you guys do it? Or like how when does that start?

Michael D: We'll give a minute for Dylan to kick things off for us here.
Shane W: Hey, everybody. Hey, everyone. Good morning. Hi.
Michael D: Hi, Shane. Hey, Dylan.
Shane W: Hello? All right. So, I think in the call today, we want to just kind of start stepping through some… of the items we identified. Is that right? Dylan? Yes, that's right. Sorry, eating breakfast finally. But before we do that, do you guys have any questions or anything you guys want to talk about?
Wayne W: I don't have any at.
Michael D: This time, I was going to say, I don't know if Ladd was introduced on the first call, but Wayne, you want to set up that introduction?
Wayne W: Yeah, yeah, no, appreciate that. Michael. So, everyone joining us today is our newest team member on the daltal Domo team. His name's Ladd. He just started yesterday, so he's going to be really focused on some more project based items such as our hope to be very soon, AI, chat feature as one of them and some other things, but probably this one as well. So, I just want to welcome him to the team.
Shane W: Well, we're glad to have you, Ladd, it is throwing you right into the fire, not giving you any time to acclimate.
Wayne W: That's right? That's the daltal way, you know, just throw you in the deep and here you go. So, he's going to be great.
Hrithvik V: Yeah.
Shane W: Well, good. Well, we're glad you're here with us. Thank you. Perfect. So, I guess Ladd, quick question for you. Do you have some Domo experience or are you kind of coming up to speed on that too? What's your background?
Hrithvik V: Yeah. I do have some Domo experience as well and some software development experience as well. Yep. Oh, perfect. Yeah. When told me about the specifically AI chat feature. So in my previous experience, I have worked a little bit on that. So, yeah, definitely looking forward for it. And nice to meet you everyone. Thank you for your warm welcome. Thank you.
Shane W: Yeah, you're welcome. Well, we're glad you're here so great. Well, last week we chatted about, you know, kind of doing a cleanup and identifying some of those data sets and data flows that we could maybe start to clean up a little bit. So, is that where we want to start? Or do we want to start on like moving things over to… moving things over to like from adrenaline over to adrenaline over to magic atl?
Michael D: I would think Shane they go hand in hand, right? We want to make sure things are clean first before moving things over that way we're not, you know, garbage in garbage out type deal. Perfect. Would it make sense then to kind of quickly then go over what those cleanup opportunities are and then kind of talk through what a migration process looks like?
Shane W: Yeah, for sure. So, let's do that. Let's start with. Have you guys in your instance, have you guys installed any, or put any, like, can you guys walk me through what you guys have done to identify data sets that are, or data flows or cards that are not being used? I know you guys did a cleanup a little while ago and it was kind of somewhat traumatic, it sounded like, but I know you guys tried to try to clean up. What have you guys done to kind of identify those things?
William M: We used the activity log to try and identify cards that hadn't been recognized? I think it was the activity log. Maybe it was just the card data set. It's been a while. So I can't remember.
Michael D: I think William, you were also taking advantage of some of the Domo stats, the data sets, and the data flows, as well as the governance toolkit?
William M: Yeah.
Shane W: Okay.
William M: And basically we identified all these cards and then we had the interns move them over to a specific page. Yeah. And I kind of thought that once it was on that page and not anywhere else, then we would recognize that it was being used and that… didn't happen. And we nuked a bunch of cards that were on dashboards that no one clicked into them, but they looked at them every day.
Shane W: Yeah. So let's see here. Now. That makes sense.
Brian F: It's probably also a bigger gap because you guys.
Shane W: All right. Let me share my screen and we'll kind of walk through. I think one of the things I want to set up with you guys that will make a big difference, at least help identify some of those things for cleanup is a dashboard that's in our app store. And I was looking to see if you guys had it already in here because sometimes people have them but they haven't put it in but I haven't seen it. So, let me share my screen and we'll kind of jump into that.
Brian F: So that we have that as team?
Shane W: Let's see. All right. So, if you go in the app store, there's. let's see before I do that, I want to just see if you guys have this governance dashboard in your instance already, I think it is already.
Michael D: Installed.
Shane W: all right, perfect. Yeah, let me dashboard.
Michael D: Now, if it changed names, that's a different story, but I don't know if there's a way just.
Shane W: To… yeah, let's see. Okay, perfect. So this is good. I'm g",Traditional Pricing Model,909824.12,NO ASSIGNED AE,DALTILE.COM,9,Engineering & Construction,9000,>=$1B,Renewal,Blank,2: Determine Needs,Michael Dixon II,2026-01-30,2023-08-12,2023-08-12,,,,,,0015000000yIb4aAAC

Good morning, everybody.
Chris L: Morning. Good.
Boobasgupta V: Morning.
Casey D: Gupta… Dave, Kyle, Lucy… William, Daniel, Kevin, everybody.
William S: Hi, Casey.
Daniel D: Good morning.
Casey D: All right. Daniel. Have you been on this call before?
Daniel D: I have, not, this is my first time being on this call.
Casey D: Welcome. And you're from what department?
Daniel D: I'm from the vcxi department, the brokerage, custom brokerage department.
Casey D: Okay. Welcome. Good to have you on. Yeah, I know this invite is spread quite far over the ups lines of business. So I'm sure there's new people popping in all the time, but basically, we like to use this call the first half to go over any general updates or questions or call outs, anything about the, you know, Domo account at ups or anything that you guys are working on? Any new use cases, projects, that sort of thing. And then the second half hour of this call is basically open office hours for technical consulting, in which case, we can have our solution consultant, Braxton, or Scott Thomas, Scott thompson or Kyle Christmas, who is your preferred support advisor to walk through any technical issues you guys might be going through. So kind of a split call, you don't have to stay for the whole thing. I mean, if you have updates and discuss them and you don't have any technical issues, it's okay to drop off and that kind of thing. So, with that in mind, who would like to kick us off from the ups side? Anything that you guys are working on, any use cases that you're struggling with, or need any questions about any Domo features or functionality that you're running into… any general questions?
Boobasgupta V: I got one thing. This is regarding the Domo workbench. So when you start a job to execute, right? Is it a way to stop the job in between? I don't want the job to execute, but there is no functionality to stop it.
Casey D: So, it's a scheduled job. And before it kicks off, you want to disable it?
Boobasgupta V: Yeah, either it is a scheduled job or I, sometimes I just… wrongly executed a job, right? Instead of another job. I executed this job. I don't want to move forward anything?
Casey D: Okay. Kyle, any Qlik call outs or anything there… or David brater, do you guys have any?
David B: Yeah. There's actually, you can disable an ETL and you can also cancel it while it's running.
Boobasgupta V: So, if.
David B: you bring up, it might be easier if I show you, if you bring up.
Boobasgupta V: Actually, I have another user using the virtual machine.
David B: Okay. Let me see if I can quickly bring something up here. Okay? All right. Let me grab an ETL. Okay?
Boobasgupta V: It's not the ETL.
David B: Okay. Yeah, no, I understand. So, let's say I'm here, right? And you're saying, what kind of job would you like to cancel? Is it a dataset update or is it an ETL running?
Boobasgupta V: No, it's not the ETL run. It's the Domo workbench job.
David B: Oh, yes, you can stop those, but you have to log into workbench. I don't have workbench. This is a mac, so I can't have workbench on this right now, but you can do a couple of things. You can go into the job itself and edit it and stop it from running. Or if it's the only job running on that, you can also stop the process itself from the windows task manager. You'd have to restart the process obviously, but both of those will stop a workbench job. Okay. Yeah, I wish I could show you that, but I can't because I'm on a mac and I don't have workbench running on this.
Boobasgupta V: Okay. Let me try the other user. If he's not using, I will bring the screen back, but you can go to the next topic.
Casey D: Yeah. While you're talking, I ran that question through… AI through our knowledge base. I ran that question. Let me see if I, and this is what it gave me. So actually Braxton, fullenkamp, the solution consultant, who you're probably familiar with, set up an AI agent in Domo that you can type in a question and it'll produce a response based on all the knowledge based documentation available. So Gupta, this is what it.
Boobasgupta V: Gave me.
Casey D: This is what it gave me back in the chat. When I asked it, how do you stop a workbench job that's already running? It says basically open the preview pane, look for the cancel button, Qlik the cancel button and it should stop the job.
Boobasgupta V: Okay. Thank you. So that may help.
Casey D: Yeah. Let us know if you have, yeah, or you can bring up your screen once you get to that, and we can have David and Kyle can look at it. And Scott is also on now too great. But yeah, who else has any call outs or questions for us today? Chris, I got your message about looking at kind of reformatting the qbrs and working with Devin this week and we'll get back to that later next, later this week in terms of kind of where we want to go with that very good. Yeah.
Chris L: We're meeting this afternoon to kind of talk it through. So I'll give you some feedback as soon as we do that.
Casey D: Sounds good. All right. What is everybody else working on these days, Daniel? You said you're part of brokerage? Are you newer to the brokerage group? Are you working under David paldrui, and kind of his use cases in Domo or what's your main… focus at this point?
Daniel D: Oh, yes. I'm a software developer. I've been on the brokerage team for about three years working on it really honestly, I'm not working on anything in regards to Domo. I mean, besides just creating different dashboards and cards, but there's really nothing for me to display or to present. I guess I would just join the call. Honestly. I joined the call because it was on my calendar. So I just decided to join to see what it was about.
Casey D: Yeah, no worries. Yeah, we don't really put people on the spot to demo what you're working on. I was just curious because I haven't spoken with you before, but yeah, anytime you want to hop on, ask questions, anything about the functionality of Domo or particular use cases or problems you're working on the broker's side, we'd be happy to address.
Daniel D: Most definitely. Thank you.

Scott B: Hey, shailaja,
Shailaja G: happy Friday.
Scott B: You as well. How you doing?
Shailaja G: Good. Hey, did you get a good harvest this time from your, oh,
Scott B: yeah, we got, I have peaches like, you wouldn't believe we've been processing peaches for days, oh.
Shailaja G: My God. So much fun. I don't know if it is so much fun or if it is like, there's a point where it's like it's.
Scott B: it's you know, what, come January, we'll be glad we did it.
Shailaja G: Okay. Yes.
Scott B: Yep. And then I've been eating just like tomatoes. I'll just cut up a bunch of tomatoes and salt and pepper, and just man, it's so good. And my wife did a really good job, in our front yard, she turned kind of like our front yard into an herb garden. So, it's pretty and, it looks like, you know, plants, but it's you know, basil and curry, and, you know, there's all these, she just has lemon balm and all these different plants thyme, so we can just pull from it as we're cooking. It's so great. I know. Yeah. Did you, did you do a garden? Yeah.
Shailaja G: We did, tomatoes, I did pumpkin, so, the plant is like growing crazy. I should have been careful, but anyways, there's squash, pumpkins. The peas are gone, the plant, yeah.
Scott B: Mine are gone too.
Shailaja G: Yeah, mine are gone, yeah. But I did okra, I did bean, green beans, And tomatoes, I mentioned that cucumber and squash.
Scott B: Yeah, that's it. We, my wife loves pumpkins on Halloween.
Shailaja G: Yes, that's why I did it.
Scott B: We have so many pumpkins, and then what we usually end up doing, I'm actually in my basement today. So, if it's echoey, that's why, but we have like a cold storage underneath our porch. So we'll take all of our pumpkins and put them in cold storage in the winter, and then I use that to feed my chickens all winter. Oh,
Shailaja G: wow.
Scott B: So, it's nice that, you know, it's like she gets her pumpkins for Halloween, but they don't go to waste because we don't really eat pumpkin very much.
Shailaja G: Yeah.
Scott B: You know, so.
Shailaja G: You can only do so much.
Scott B: Yeah, I like to roast the seeds.
Shailaja G: Yeah.
Scott B: Oh, yeah, you know, but, but usually we just feed them to our chickens all winter long and, they seem to love it. Yeah, it's been good. Well, good. I'm glad you got a good harvest. Do you have any trees?
Shailaja G: No, I don't have that big of a garden. We can just do some plants which is good enough. And when we, I know me and my husband are not the people that would maintain a big garden, okay?
Scott B: So, we.
Shailaja G: were like, yes, this is good enough space. We'll get a little bit but not too much.
Scott B: Yeah, yeah, good. This is my favorite time of year cause you just have just so many vegetables and yeah, I love it. We make really good like my wife made a really good like tomato curry probably last Friday or Saturday and it's just like all fresh right out of the garden. You know, it's so good.
Shailaja G: Life can't be any better trust?
Scott B: Me. Yeah, yeah, it's good. Well, how did your conversations this week go?
Shailaja G: Yes. Oh, I mostly spoke with Robert and I kind of get where he is and what he's looking for. But I also gave him my point of view and here's where we stand. Okay? What he's saying is get… us through March, which is when our contract kind of ends and see if we can get the credits that we want in increments of 1,000, right? Okay, get us through March. Come March. We'll have a better idea of what projects, what big projects we are going to do, and that's when we can rethink the contract or do whatever. So maybe come January we can or Jan, feb, let's do that. So he's just saying pull me through March. Okay? And then we can talk other things. But I did mention that, hey, Robert. I know we are saying that, but I anticipate that there might be a project which is the finance project again, that might need some technical support. And I do want to say that I might, I mean that again, I will leave that to Elisa. I've been asking her, hey, that if you need something you need to tell anyways, that's with her and that's what I communicated with Robert too. Right? Hey, I'm only supporting her. It's her project. I want her to take that call and have that conversation with the finance team. But I do see that might be one project which from the beginning needed the technical support that if ever it did, there's another project that's going on behind the scenes which is Andrew, you met Andrew, right? Yes, we are hoping that he delivers what he has promised. But if he cannot, for some reason, I want to have a plan B which is plan B is coming to Domo. I have an intern, but he's at school, I cannot put this huge project on his head and not… get it delivered. So that's like my plan B is, can I get some technical support should something not happen the way I have anticipated? So those are the only two projects that I can think of for these two years. For that reason, I'm not committing to that 20,000 dollar case program for this year… but I still want to be able to get some support if not like a full fledged support.
Scott B: So we can always just contract hours as needed. Okay? I mean, hopefully you saw the value of having like a Dan?
Shailaja G: Oh, yeah. I know Dan is awesome. It's.
Scott B: just the difference between ace and consulting, like I would never not consulting because they do a great job, but they need to be told and they'll do exactly what you tell them to do and they'll do it and I'll be happy to do it. The benefit of Dan is like he thinks.
Shailaja G: Things through the soul.
Scott B: Three, four, five steps ahead. It's just a world of difference, you know? Yes.
Shailaja G: That's how I am, that's how, yes, business user come technical. The combination is rare and, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Scott B: Yeah. So that's okay. We can kind of punt that one for now and just, you know, kind of figure it.
Shailaja G: Out. But if you wanted Dan's hours like let's say we can kind of come up with a contract for whatever hours that Eliza wants. Yeah.
Scott B: We can always just contract hours. It'll just be with",Consumption Pricing Model,28000.0,Corporate,ENVEDABIO.COM,2,Life Sciences,1,$10M to <$25M,,,,,,,,,,,,,001Vq0000021RTFIA2

Sarah C: Yeah. Well, they just, they get addicted to it. They're addicted to the movement, but, you know, we used to watch TV and that was supposed to be bad for us but, yeah.
Jaran P: Who?
Sarah C: Would have thought, that you would encourage your child to watch TV and something that like it takes 30 minutes to pay attention to.
Jaran P: Yeah. Now, it's just the lights and like, you know, people are always on facetime talking to him. He's like what's this thing? It's like does so many things. Yeah.
Sarah C: It's crazy. Cool. All right?
Jaran P: Yeah.
Sarah C: So, I think we're overall, I think we're in a good spot. I'm waiting for India to get back to me with benchmarks. Okay? I sent out everything to Malaysia. I have not heard from them, which kind of concerns me because I was trying to schedule a training for them. So we'll see, but overall, thank you for correcting some of those like little issues that we saw in the UK. I think that they're… now, it's really honestly, it's just a matter of people actually going and utilizing it because everyone's kind of scared to utilize the.
Jaran P: Tool really? Okay. I was just about to ask you that because it seems like the UK, they're testing it out. I think that's exactly what we need, right? So.
Sarah C: Yeah, but they're testing it out with themselves. They're not testing it out in front of doctors and like it's because they don't understand the true math behind it that they don't believe it like they're like, well, what about this? They're just scared. So, Germany is taking the leap. They have doctor meetings to run the tool, so that's positive. I have a feedback session next week with Germany and Spain reporting in on what it's like to use it. How do they get into a customer? How do the conversations go? Things like that? So it's kind of like all I can tell them is you have to try it like you have to have those conversations with the doctor and they are. So it's not the tool that scares them. They just don't know how to communicate it but you don't know how to communicate it unless you don't talk to someone.
Jaran P: Yeah. Exactly. Wow. That's pretty good though. Germany is taking the leap and trying it. Yeah, great. Okay. So, it's working.
Sarah C: It's working. I think everything's working. I think everything's you know, we're going to have more come on board. We just need them to utilize it. And that's the struggle I'm having is like I've offered to go back over there and do calls and clinics and run it. So we'll see if anyone takes me up on that. Hopefully, hopefully someone will because it will help their business, but they've got to stop being scared.
Jaran P: Yeah. Exactly. The UK, it seems like they have a lot of different like scenarios, the one with the benchmarks not being like not being visible to the doctors and stuff like that. So I'm curious to see if that we're going to get similar feedback from other regions.
Sarah C: Yeah. Well, I think the problem with the UK is the UK does not have good enough relationships with their doctors to number one understand the market and number two have those conversations.
Jaran P: I.
Sarah C: think it's just a lack of like to me, it's a lack of actually knowing your business and your customers. So that's why there's so many like they keep thinking about all this stuff that is just personal fear instead of an actual, nothing is founded like what their concerns are non founded.
Jaran P: Okay.
Sarah C: Yeah, it's just someone putting up like procrastination or something.
Jaran P: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Sarah C: I did reach out to, I reached out to the US team to have a meeting with them to show kind of initial uptake and like from Germany and stuff. I have not heard back from them. So I'm hoping that this is still a consideration for next year for the U. S. But I'm not really sure.
Jaran P: Okay. Yeah. And if, yeah, I wonder, if they don't go through it, they're like the reasoning and stuff. So maybe if it's like something we can do to help.
Sarah C: I don't think it has anything to do with you. I think it's just politics.
Jaran P: Yeah. Okay. Fair. The only other question I had was the France so we got the translations but we don't have the benchmarks yet. I was thinking I could just like hold off and just do it all at once. Once we do that. Okay? Do you know when that's going to happen?
Sarah C: I don't actually that room at all. I'll email their boss and ask them when should I be receiving benchmarks for Sweden? Like all of like the nordics, France, all of those. So I'll email him and ask him because they did… they presented that because it's distributor markets. So, meaning that there's a one lead in that market from star and then they have, then they sell it to a third party to sell it to doctors. And they have, they presented it to all of their distributors in Copenhagen and all the distributors loved it. So when it's giving them a reason to work with their distributor more closely. And so, I think there was a lot of positive momentum from those markets, but I haven't gotten any of their benchmarks. So I will email.

The participants also discussed plans for parallel efforts around reports, data sets, and workflow, and agreed to switch their weekly meetings to Microsoft Teams.","Jesse M: see you, Sam. Hey, guys.
Shane W: Hey, how's it going?
Jesse M: All right now, I can hear you, sorry.
Shane W: I don't know if anybody else from Domo is going to join this call.
Jesse M: All right. Well, what do you got for me Shane?
Shane W: Well… I was on vacation, so I've been getting my feedback under me.
Jesse M: All right. So, I think we talked about on the last call, just some of the other use cases that we wanted to mess around with. The first thing I need to get coordinated is the instance name change. Yeah, I've got the work order opened with Gallagher with the team that does all the configuration for us. So I just need to get them with you guys and we can set something up.
Shane W: Yeah, we started that process. So I will follow up with our team to see where we're at. Okay with that, and then we can set up a time with your team to make that transition.
Jesse M: Okay. And then also, there's going to be some, and we talked about this a little bit, but there's a couple other sso related configurations… that we might need to walk the Gallagher team through also so that we can make sure everything's working because right now, we can only get to Domo through the one link that they set up versus every, unless you're already logged in any email report, schedule or link in teams or the mobile app. Like none of that works with sso. It just takes you to the old Domo login page, which isn't set up.
Shane W: I mean, just making sure I have all these notes here.
Jesse M: Okay.
Sam: Hey, Jesse, I just got back on. I couldn't hear anything but I'm good to go now.
Jesse M: Okay. All right. So.
Shane W: The issue is that, so if you get a link in your email, even if you've already gone through the sso and logged in, you still have to, if.
Jesse M: you're logged in, you're good. It'll just open.
Shane W: Right up, but you don't want to, we don't want to have to go if you have already gone to your sso, we want to just be able to go and authenticate it. We don't want to have to go back to Domo and authenticate again, right? Is that what's happening?
Jesse M: I'm fine with that. I mean, as long as I mean, I think when I turn off the mixed login mode, you know, you'll Qlik the link, it'll open up the login portal. And so if you have access to login, one way, you can with username and password, where you can Qlik the sso button right now, that doesn't work, right? I have to go through the idm or whatever. Yeah, yeah.
Shane W: Perfect. Okay. Yeah.
Jesse M: And I think that impacts the mobile app also. So there's no.
Shane W: All right. I'll follow up on the name and the sso issues. Is that, and those are the main things that we are, we want to get through right now, right?
Jesse M: Yeah, I think they're the first ones we're going to tackle when manating's on vacation right now. So, I think next week, we can kind of spin up, some parallel efforts around just reports and data sets, and some of the workflow stuff you guys gave a demo of. I think we had some use cases around attacking, that was going to be Patrick from manating's team… who's playing around with some of that stuff. And then rob, I mean, same thing. You know, if you've got anything specific, we're trying… to just get out the door and, or clean up or make cool, we can add that to the file.
Shane W: Let's see… and then we have our next meeting, is it only on Fridays do we meet?
Jesse M: No, I think it's on Thursdays and they just push this with a Friday?
Shane W: Friday. Yeah. Okay. Perfect.
Jesse M: And if you could have them switch us over to teams, they'd probably make things easier. Yeah.
Shane W: Yeah, I'll have that switched over to teams? All right. Was there anything else I guess right now that we can discuss or questions you guys have?
Jesse M: No, not for me, rob, Sam, did you guys have anything… I don't right now, Sam?
Sam: No, I'm good.
Jesse M: All right, cool.
Shane W: Well, if anything ever comes up, feel free to send an email or text or call me and, you know, anytime and we can meet and review whatever questions you guys might have.

Ryan G: My.
Marcus L: machine is down, so I had to crank up the old PS three.
Scott P: Download zoom.

Scott P: I bet it has something to do with your machine. I,
Marcus L: guess I thought I did say the name before. I don't use zoom all that often. So, yeah, see.
Scott P: That makes sense. Should we give Ryan a couple of minutes?
Marcus L: Yeah. Let's give him a couple of minutes. Then we have Fayez on the line. I believe you ever met Fayez yet, right? Scott?

Scott P: Nice to meet you too.
Marcus L: Yeah, Fayez is the latest addition to our team. Nice to.
Scott P: Meet you, Fayez. Are you a data engineering background as well?
Fayez B: Oh, yeah. I live and breathe data engineering.
Scott P: Nice. What stacks have you used in the past?
Fayez B: Oh, not Domo. I hadn't heard about Domo, but Aws, mostly, it's like my big background, yeah.
Scott P: Building like a data lake on S iii and then running whatever else on top of it.
Fayez B: Yeah, that's my type, but yep. So, basically, that using glue and lambdas and all that stuff. So, but, yep.
Scott P: Yeah, that makes sense. Oh… yeah. Nice to meet you if we want to jump into it. Like either you, Marcus or Ryan can share your screen and I can show you where you find how to redirect a workbench job.
Marcus L: Yeah, I can share my screen. Just give me a second. I need to pull up the right one.
Scott P: And I scheduled 45 minutes, but if it doesn't take that long, we don't have to like fill the whole time like, yeah.
Marcus L: Okay. I think this would be a good example. Hold on. Yeah, let me pull that one.
Ryan G: Off this one. Okay?
Marcus L: So,
Scott P: I know that Vu has like talked about like cost saving strategies for like the Delmo footprint and the demo bill, like, as is your background playing a piece into that phase. Not like.
Fayez B: Maybe cost savings but more organizing architectural wise. Yeah, somewhat, but, yeah.
Scott P: So, are you looking at building on Aws? Now? I know that we had talked about like Microsoft and Microsoft fabric previously like on our on site with you guys, but you were evaluating like some of those options. Yeah, definitely. Yeah.
Fayez B: We're definitely still in exploration and basically looking at what we can do what we need because we have a lot of different variables to consider. But yeah, it's still in the early phases, but.
Ryan G: Basically.
Fayez B: Yeah.
Scott P: I'm seeing, your workbench here. Well.
Marcus L: Bench. Okay, good. I'm just trying to make sure that it's on the right.
Ryan G: Screen. Okay?
Marcus L: Okay. Cool.
Scott P: So, I don't know if we want to just create a dummy job like as an example first, and then we can like show you where to do it in another job.
Marcus L: Yeah. Sure. We could create a dummy job, yes.
Scott P: I like it. So the place where you will like write a job like choose to write a job to another data set. Yeah, you'll come over to configure and get that set up and then I've seen it that if we come back over to overview, let's. Open these demo details here. So it's right here, you can select, the data set name. So you have to create a job first, but then you can select the data set in Domo that you want to write it to. So… the idea here is that like with systems like quickbooks instead of having, a separate data set that we're writing to for each opco, and each like object in quickbooks, like we can have one invoice table that we're writing to like with all of the, all of the jobs. So essentially, we just need to go through and create jobs that write to the same data set instead of two different data sets.
Marcus L: Okay. What you're saying? So essentially, our jobs would just have to be like instead of naming it like this, it would just be like one central name not tied to any company and an invoice, and then create all the separate jobs that will then. Yeah, so.
Scott P: Your job can still use this naming convention, that would still make sense for the job. It's just that instead of creating a separate data set… we're writing it to the same master data set for that object.
Ryan G: Yeah. So basically, you, have, we have four companies on quickbooks. You would have four different jobs that write to the same table. Yeah.
Fayez B: And so it just automatically appends them, how?
Marcus L: Does it refresh those four different data sets then into that one master table? Yeah.
Scott P: Like if you're using append as the update type here? So, if we go to the configuration and we have it set to append, which you would want append in this case… then it'll… yeah, it'll just append it to the same data set, but,
Ryan G: would it know to like replace the rows of that company? So, like we do this for asi, we don't want it to like append asi's invoices over and over again. Yeah.
Scott P: In that case, we could use like a partition or an upsert using a partition key or an upsert key? Do you guys know if you have?
Marcus L: You still want free if you have the job. Yeah.
Scott P: So… essentially, like in order to run a partition or an upsert, you set a partition or upsert key here in the schema… have you guys done that before in your workbench? Because I know that sometimes it needs to be enabled in order to use upsert or partition, no?
Marcus L: Not that I know of it's. Always been replaced or.
Ryan G: I'm pretty sure we had partition enabled, but I don't think we ever actually started using it.
Scott P: Let me also.
Ryan G: With these quickbooks, data sets, I don't think that we have like a, any sort of key that tells us which like the name ",Consumption Pricing Model,462834.6253846154,Corporate,ASTRASERVICEPARTNERS.COM,2,Professional Services,0,< $5M,Upsell,Blank,Closed Won,Eric Smith,2025-09-21,2025-09-10,2025-09-12,2025-09-12,2025-09-12,2025-09-21,2025-09-21,,0015w00002qxRuTAAU

David S: I'm not sure. Let me check with Linh, and see if she plans on joining. All right. Well, she's not responding, so, I don't know if she'll be here or not. Unfortunately. Well.
Shane W: Yeah, we're recording this. If she wants to watch it, she can, we'll send it to her but let's just jump into it and kind of I just wanted to walk through the progress we made on the ap… AI utility that we've been working on. I just wanted to kind of walk through. I've made some good progress on it this week and so it's we're in a, it's… not quite finished though, so, but it's getting closer. One of the things that I will ask because I've been building this in a development environment. One of the things I will need is for you guys to, and I'm using a new it's a beta feature called file sets that allows us to load these unstructured data like the PDFS and things like that. And so we'll need to get that turned on. But there's a beta program that I'll send you guys and I don't know who, if it's who the right person is for this. I don't know who… kind of acts as like your main major Domo. Is it you, David? Or Michelle? I can't remember.
Sabrina P: Oh, that would be me.
Shane W: Okay. So, Michelle, yeah, I'll have you, I'll work with you and we can, we just need to have you guys say that you want to try this beta feature. It doesn't affect anything other than it's it just adds more to your environment and allows us to be able to load files in. And then once we have that in there, I'll move this over the tool that I'm going to show you guys. I'll move it over into your instance, and then you guys can interact… with it as I'm developing it, and then we can kind of start iterating on it and make it better, but let me walk you through where I'm at, and then we can go from there. All right. So the way I'm kind of envisioning this or the way I'm building it is there's and we talked a little bit about this last week but there's this will be an app. And if you guys, I don't know if you guys have used apps very much in your instance, but there's this app… it's called ap invoice. And what's nice about it. It's not too different from just a regular dashboard except that everything just it takes fills the whole screen, the visualizations and slightly better. It's just a little bit nicer environment where you can keep everything in one spot. So we're going to I'm, going to put it into this app and it's going to be called. We can call it whatever we want. I'm just calling it ap invoice. And so there'll be two tabs will be this load invoice and a review invoice. So in the load invoice, you'll go and you can choose the invoices that you want to send through. So you can choose let's say up to 10 at a time. So you would Qlik on it and open. And then you can give it a batch name if you want. We could put other information in here too. I just put batch to put something in there. We can put if there's other information that you want to be able to name… these files, we can do that or metadata we want to put on about these. Then we Qlik upload file and then that loads the file into that file sets that I was telling you about that we want to add. And then it kicks off our AI. And then so the AI is running in this… the workflow and you can see that it's in progress and we're still in development. Sometimes it's been running fine, but it, sometimes we get little errors, but we go in and show you what it's doing, but it's fairly simple. It takes off this process and inside of this tile, this is where we've… kind of added in a bunch of like instructions for how the AI should handle those invoices. So it takes, it parses, it takes the image, it converts it to tech, and then it will go in and we look at the chart of accounts, the vendor list, I'm adding in thought, I had it in here, a look at all the locations… and so that it can kind of know, okay, how do we code this correctly? So, it goes through, and we have all that information and therefore to use to know, okay, where it is and I'm working on this right now too is like, the medications, or like taking the historical items from the invoices, and how they were mapped, which account. So, it will know, how to out correctly. But once this runs, it outputs the data into, it outputs the data. And then you can go into this where you can review the invoices. So we can see all the invoices that have been loaded. And so, and… these will be all the ones that have been loaded, that haven't been reviewed yet or, and sent. So, we Qlik on one of them. It kind of shows the high level like what is this? What's in it? And then you go down here and you can say… it'll display the invoice here. And then you can go and you can look and say, okay, how was it coded? And you can see the transaction lines are there. And if we want to change anything, you can Qlik on that edit. And then we can go in and we can adjust these lines or add a new line if we needed to. And then, and then, you can save it, save… the changes. And then I haven't finished the final part where it'll push the… we'll, need another button for like a review and then a submit or like or maybe that's kind of I want to know your guys' workflow on that, but we can have a submit and then you Qlik submit, it will load, the… invoice these, this information along with the image into the accounting system and then you, you'll be able to… then it will it'll be a journal entry? I mean, there's a few other things too like we need to get like the session id and things like that. But, but for the most part, I think that that's kind of where we're at here… with this.
Michelle C: I have a few questions. So for the review portion, once an invoice has been reviewed, will it be removed from that dropdown selection?
Shane W: Yeah. So, we can set up. I was thinking that after it was submitted, we could, we would remove it, but if you guys want, we can remov",Consumption Pricing Model,52000.0,Corporate,MYCHN.ORG,2,Non Profit Org,35,$10M to <$25M,Upsell,Blank,2: Determine Needs,Chance Ewell,2025-11-16,2025-08-18,2025-09-30,,,,,,0013800001Jm7h4AAB

Brian F: I'll let you go, okay?
Nik K: So I think really where we want to start is just understand your current process today. If you have existing reports, maybe we can look at those and just get an understanding for what you track today. And that will kind of be table stakes is what to be building Domo. And then we can talk about as we go through that process of how you get to those reports where your pain points are. Are there any challenges in or any gaps in your current reporting that you know, we can look at addressing or streamlining the process, adding more information in there. So, would you have a report that we can pull up and start looking at?
Lisa M: I do have a report. We do, we do it's called the daily aging report. Okay. Let me see if I can. Do you want me to share my screen or do you want me to send it to you?
Nik K: Share screen works and then maybe you can share it afterwards too?
Lisa M: It's a, it's a giant document. I could just share like one day's worth probably the easiest. Yeah. Well, I'm trying to get to it here. It's big, biggest pain points on it. A, it takes about 30 minutes to create. So that's 30 minutes every day we're you know, working on this, the other is it leaves a lot of room for user error and… like because we're copying in and out of excel and into onto the, you know, Google doc, you have to copy and paste a certain way, you know, and that's not done. Sometimes somebody forgets. So you get bad data. It also seems like when we're pulling it from nav, especially from nav, like things like if there is a payment that's open on the customer that's not applied anywhere, it doesn't show even as a credit. So the balance would be off. We've encountered that a couple times and just little blips here and there in, the information that we pull up, we seem to have a lot of problems with. So it's still loading. So.
Nik K: One.
Kris C: Big.
Lisa M: Thing though, that we would need to work with you guys to make sure that it's… sometimes somehow we have to figure this out is we rely a lot on our notes and… the notes… we, you know, just copy and paste and use a formula. So it pulls from the previous day. That would be something that we would have to try and figure out how either like download from Domo and add notes or something like that. But that's something that's definitely a flag in our, on our end. So.
Nik K: These are currently notes that you add next to the customers row or something? Yeah.
Lisa M: Yeah, I'll share the screen here, so.
Dave: But I think that the note would be, like those notes aren't actually getting in the Domo right now. They're happening in this G sheet. So like what we're looking for is like, how do we do this in an app studio or something like that, right?
Lisa M: So, can you guys see? I can't see, yeah, we don't have a good zoom app. So, if, so this is what it pulls, we, it's just raw data we get and then we just drop it into this magnificent spreadsheet that Robert made for us, that kind of turns it into usable data. And then at the end of the sheet, we have a column that we pull for each customer and we update the notes as, you know, as often as we can or as needed. Okay?
Nik K: And,
Lisa M: it's by, you know, how the aging terms and then by state and it's some of it's a lot more than others. So we can change the information that we pull like this. Like we don't need to pull some of the information that we pull currently on this.
Nik K: Okay. And so this is the output view you paste somewhere else and these formulas are pulling it in here.
Lisa M: Well, no, the formulas are all on other sheets. This is all, the only formulas that are in the sheet are to look for previous days to pull information.
Brian F: This is the raw data though.
Lisa M: No, the raw data is, let's see. I can show you. Let's see.

Karl A: Sorry, my sound wasn't working again. Weird.
Michael N: Huh.
Karl A: Seems to happen a lot actually.
Tivakanoa S: Wow.
Michael N: It's just, it's zoom or it's the computer.
Karl A: I think it's the computer because it isn't just zoom. It also happens in teams.
Michael N: Are you on a PC?
Karl A: I am.
Michael N: There you go.
Karl A: Oh, I see.
Tivakanoa S: The troubleshooting… in that. Is that's fun.
Michael N: We'll give a few more minutes. This is Joe. Hey, Kevin. Hey, Tracy.
Karl A: Good morning. Hey, good morning.
Tivakanoa S: Good morning.
Michael N: All right. I think, do we have everyone from the ipg side… there's? Brandon? Hey, Brandon.
Tivakanoa S: Hello?
Michael N: All right, Carl, let's open it up. Oh, I should probably start with, Tiva, what do we have for updates on tickets? Yeah.
Tivakanoa S: So, first off, I'll start from our Otis tickets. So, Kevin, they actually… that endpoint that you're trying to hit with that API that you're using for workflows. They found some things. So, you were right. It is documented. It did work. They found that it worked for about five days in 20 24. They just never updated it. So, right now, what they're doing is they're working to get the right endpoint. And then they're going to update the documentation. So we just have to wait for that. They're trying to figure out what endpoint is valid right now with public apis. It's a little bit hard. They don't really document it that well on our end. Okay, good. This is man. It's recorded. Okay, don't tell anyone they said that, but yeah. So the API needs to be updated, they're going to document it and get it over to you, Kevin. So I'm just waiting for that from them. Let's see. Cool.
Karl A: Thank you.
Tivakanoa S: Yeah, if there's any questions, let me know, but yeah, we have so far the webhook connector issue. I know that that's big for you guys. It is. Escalated, I do have that with our engineering team who's actively working on it. They let's see the newest one because they just updated it last night. They're saying that the data upstream is what's causing the failure. There's a fail to parse the Json for data id, three zero, nine nine five one. After processing about 45 rows, that's what happens that's why it's taking too long to… parse all the way through. I do have next steps. They are also open to getting on a call. So if we need to set that up, Carl, we can do that as well. Just let me know what you want to do. But they're wanting to see if we can reach out to workfront to better understand the data that's coming in since it's an upstream thing. But I've never had an engineer openly offer to jump on a call. So if I were you, I would take it and I can set that up for us, but I'll make sure that I have tickets just so that you understand exactly what we found. And then what you want to, you could choose to do it or you could choose what you're wanting to do moving forward Carl.
Karl A: So that's going to go into the ticket?
Tivakanoa S: Yeah. I'm going to update the ticket and then, so you understand everything and then let you choose what you want to do mixed ups, wise? Okay?
Karl A: Cool. Thanks.
Tivakanoa S: Okay. The next one is that your… small filters on dashboards, they're not displaying properly. That is actually a well known issue. It broke. They had a release on Tuesday for some hotfixes, that kind of broke some other things. It got verified and pushed out yesterday for a hotfix. So that should be resolved if you want to go and look through that, just let me know what the behavior is. But I would give it just some time because it takes time to validate through each instance. And let me see here is prod. And so just if you want to check now, if not, it should be updated or finished or completed by this afternoon, but yeah, if you want to verify that, and then that is actually all I have that isn't being treated as an enhancement request one is for Dale about the email sending queue? Yes, that is all I have at the moment. Yeah.
Michael N: All right, Carl, anything else for Tiva?
Karl A: I'm just checking now to see if the filters thing is being resolved?
Tivakanoa S: Yeah. It looks.
Karl A: like that actually, yes.
Tivakanoa S: Yeah, a lot of the… notes that came in about the issue was they were calling it squishy cards because they were just, yeah, so sorry about that, but it should be resolved and looks like it is. So I'll go ahead and close that out.
Karl A: Okay. Cheers. Yeah. It's funny. This is not the first time this has happened. It actually happened. I think a couple of months ago when there was another release.
Tivakanoa S: Oh, okay. Well, yeah. Sorry about that. Thank you for catching it though.
Karl A: Yeah. Well, I don't think I raised it last time because I think at the time you guys were doing something to change the cards. I can't remember what, but yeah, that's what I raised it this time because, you know, nothing was said and hopefully it doesn't happen again in the future.
Tivakanoa S: Okay. Yes, thank you.
Karl A: Otherwise, nothing else on my side.
Michael N: Nothing else on your side, Carl? No, okay. Tracy.
Tracy P: Nothing for me. I did watch the worksheets presentation thing yesterday.
Michael N: Oh, cool. What'd you think?
Tracy P: I mean, it looks pretty good. When does that release? Because there was a whole bunch of different dates of things releasing and I can't remember which is that already out?
Michael N: Joe, you've been there all week. Did we officially release that yet?
Tivakanoa S: I don't think it's official yet. I think that was a teaser. So, no, I'll keep you updated, Tracy, if I hear anything because everyone that I work with is dying for that one. Okay. So, yeah, but no, I don't think it's official yet. I'm sorry, Mike.
Michael N: Hasn't hit beta yet?
Tivakanoa S: No, that's what I mean, I don't think it's available in beta yet.

Juliana J: I have.
Shannon C: To work or even when they're like off, he's not like off because there's always somebody who's asking for something.
Juliana J: Definitely. All right. It looks like we have a full house. I think we've got everyone here. I don't know if Colin was going to join I.
Shannon C: Don't think so. I think he's yeah.
Juliana J: Okay. No worries. Hey, shavam, how are you, hi?
Shivam M: Juliana, I'm good. How about you?
Juliana J: Doing well. Awesome. Thanks everybody for joining on a Friday before a long weekend. So we wanted to continue kind of talking about use cases with you guys, see if you had anything additional from the last time we talked, and then we also wanted to see, I know we had talked about some like data pipeline, ETL, cleanup optimization opportunities. So we were wondering if you had any like data flows or any dashboards, anything like that targeted already that you wanted us to jump and take a look at. So I guess that was two things there. So I guess maybe we can start with the second item. So if there's anything that you had in mind that you wanted us to take a look at specifically within your instance?
Shivam M: Like when you mentioned in the mail, I've gone through all our etls and I see that like they are quite robust like before me earlier, there was Brian. So he has done a lot of modifications in that. And regarding the credit point utilization, I, with fui, and I don't remember the name. I think it was Jason or somebody else, but he helped me a lot through the modification of the etls. I feel that they are in the good spot right now and the credit utilization, the update frequency, everything is going good. We were facing few problems regarding data from intrada and Nick in the last session. He has helped me resolving that also. So as of now, I don't feel that there is much we can do in our instance as of now regarding the better performance of etls and something else.
Nik K: Okay. So from the perspective of credit cleanup, I know you guys have done a lot with Tanner?
Shivam M: Yes.
Nik K: Just in terms of if you have questions around structuring etls or any best practices, any new tiles, or if you've you know, if you have anything that's you feel is doing, you know, it's very complex or you might have done five or six tiles and you think, is there a better way like we can help with those areas?
Shivam M: I'll show you there are a few things and which I haven't touched them because when I joined, they were like this. So I never get into… them very deeply. I'll share my screen so that you can see how it looks like on our end, give me a second.
Nik K: Yeah. And as you're pulling that up, that was one area. And I think, you know, when we started a couple of weeks ago, you had pointed out there's still some legacy etls and you were just looking for some best practices?
Shivam M: Yes. So these are those.
Nik K: Okay.
Shivam M: I think it's too big. So it's taking time to loading as well.
Nik K: Okay. Yeah, that's something we can look at.
Shivam M: So right now, if you see these are all our legacy etls and this is what we are using for our budget plus actual all time. But the issue which I feel is these etls and you see here and they are not using any, you know, core data set. These are all etls. And when I Qlik on, this is another ETL. So, and then that one is also connected to another ETL. So what happens that when ETL level one, you know, refreshes it consumes some data points. And then it forces level two ETL to refresh again. Then it goes to level three, then it comes to this final level four and this updates here. And, you know, these things updates and they consume more credit points. So initially a process which started by refreshing a core data set that is on weekdays basis, Monday to Friday, 10 am and it ended up consuming 25 to 30 credit points just for that particular data set, if it is refreshing. So for that, as you have advised and earlier, you know, Domo team members advised what I have done, I have fixed their schedule time. So irrespective of when a data set updates, I have fixed their timings that, you know, Monday to Friday or according to the reuse case, this is a fixed time when a particular data flow is going to update. So I will show you what I meant by like how actually it's all structured. I think I might just move it there.
Nik K: And since you've moved to the scheduled times instead, you're not missing any runs, right? Because if you've set the schedule too early and the previous one takes too long, you haven't missed any data in that way.
Shivam M: No, no. Because initially, what happened, I changed it to fixed timing. So we had some issues that some of the guys they want a refreshed report on Wednesday and some other time. So, along with Shannon, she has helped me a lot. So we have fixed the timelines then on which particular day we need them to be updated.

Shane W: Hey, how's it going? Oh, good. I'm just probably waiting for that. See.
Jesse M: Hey, guys. Sorry, I'm late.
Shane W: Hey, Jesse.
Jesse M: Hey, Shane. Can you guys hear me? Yeah, yeah, I can hear you. Can you hear me?
Shane W: Hello, is anybody there? Yeah.
Jesse M: Yeah, can everybody? Yes. Yeah, here, we'll type them.
Shane W: Hey, everybody. Can you hear me now?
Jesse M: Yep. We can still hear you.
Shane W: I don't know. I couldn't hear you guys. I don't know what's wrong with my computer, but I apologize for that. It was working in the beginning.
Jesse M: Happens.
Shane W: All right here. Let's go. So, Jesse, thanks for sending over that list of topics… that we kind of discussed… last week. And so I started looking at the ado data sets… and I have a question… in with our support team about that because it just, you know, like the work list like data like doesn't feel like it's coming in and then saying you don't have access to things. I'm assuming that you're an admin in there. So you probably should have access to all of the, all of that… all the data that's in that inside of ado. So, I'm asking, I have a question about them about what we should expect in terms of the response on those things and why we're getting these errors. Okay? And then the, and then, you know, there's several other things in here. I don't know where, oh, the training programs… I don't know did onkit, send you guys a list of the events… the training events that we have.
Jesse M: I've been getting emails from different ones coming up. I saw that there was a intensive… one, out in Utah coming up.
Shane W: Yeah. So we have, you know, we have like onsite ones that we do, and they also do a lot of just remote ones that people can log, you know, just sign up for and be part of like a virtual class. And there's like a real instructor, so you can ask questions and do all those things. But yeah, and those ones are free. I don't know if the onsite ones, what they, what the costs are for those. But if it's something that you guys are interested in doing, we may be able to even get you guys if you want to come out and be onsite, we could maybe even get you guys signed up for that without a cost. But yeah, I mean, we're.
Jesse M: all so spread out anyway, that the virtual stuff probably makes the most sense.
Shane W: Yeah, but there's I know they have lots of those sessions. And so if you have any questions about those or if you have issues signing up, let me know and we'll we can make sure that we can get those questions resolved so that you guys can actually sign up for those things. And then the request form and process. I haven't had a chance to look into that at all yet, but I'll make some time this week to kind of start diving into that a little bit more and see, but I think getting connected to the ado is probably more important than that… then I think we were going to talk about. Were… we going to talk about moving some Qlik dashboards over?
Jesse M: Is.
Shane W: that on our list of trying to put some Qlik or tableau data flows into or data sets into Domo?
Jesse M: It is… banting, where would you put that as a priority? I know it's going to involve resources and time from our side also. So we just need to kind of align with that.
Man T: And also, I think last week, Jesse, the one you were talking about is for the data capture initiative, right?
Jesse M: Yeah. I figured we might as.
Man T: Well, start with that. Yeah, we should start after our consultants line up the metrics that we want to see, then we can build it instead of just mirror what we have now all.
Jesse M: Right? That's fair. So it's going, Shane, we're in meetings right now, we're trying to align on metrics with the corporate team so that we can all speak the same language with this stuff and we should have that locked in fairly soon, so that'll basically be the new requirements. So once we have those, then it'll make sense to kind of move it over.
Shane W: Okay. That sounds great. So then the… I guess where do we want to spend our time today? Is there anything where we should?
Jesse M: Focus. Well, I think outside of the list I sent, I mean, unless there's unless any of that you would like to dive deeper into, I think. And unless anyone else has anything specific… Sam, is there anything you're working on right now that we can throw on the panel from a Domo's standpoint?
Samantha H: I don't think so. The only thing was putting manting's dataset into workbench. The one that has a bajillion rows, I'm meeting with Suresh, about the dsn. I don't think we'll run into any issues with permissions, and then I should be able to set everything out from there easily. But if I have issues, I'm sure we can go over it next week in the next call, but it should be going okay?
Shane W: Great. The, one question I have was the claims dataset data flows, is that I'm trying to remember what that one was regarding… like what we need to do on that, if it's something that we're just waiting for data to come in and then we can stitch together with the other datasets or that's if the data's already there and we can start working.
Jesse M: On that. Was that, was that the long running query that we wanted to move to workbench? Is that the one we're talking about?
Man T: No, that is the one Jesse, I think, you started with different, a few excel files from different carrier. Oh.
Jesse M: Yeah, sorry, all the claim stuff, yeah.
Shane W: Sorry. And did we talk about that last week? And maybe I just not.
Jesse M: Not in any detail, but, I can, if you want to record this, I can do a quick walkthrough to give you an idea?
Shane W: Yeah, that, let me okay. Also recording it now.
Jesse M: Actually, maybe the best way to go into this is. All right. So, we dropped some notes at the top of this thing because it's right now, it's really just us trying to figure out all the pieces and how we want to fit them together. So, we're consuming data… feeds via email and attachments right now. And then we'll hopefully land on a process where we can build some automation around this in the future.

Brian F: Questions we want to be here. So it sounds like that, what we talked about last time is at least you haven't had any issues implementing it or? Yes.
Shivam M: Because the… thing which has helped me a lot is that you developed that dashboard into our instance. So whenever, like if I'm stuck somewhere, I reference that. So that is a big help.
Brian F: Well, okay. I'm trying to think what else? Then? I mean, again, we don't need to sit here on the phone. If you're doing good. We're here to support you.
Shivam M: I'm doing great because of you guys only. Thank you.
Brian F: Okay. Well, excellent. I'm glad to hear it. All right. Well, look like I said, we don't need to sit on the phone. If you're doing good, we can keep these. And even if every single meeting is like, this will make me happy, thank you for.
Shivam M: Doing this?
Brian F: What's that?
Shivam M: Thank you so much for doing this. Yeah, sorry, Nick, are you saying something?
Nik K: Yeah, I just had one set of questions I just wanted to check with you on. So I know we had spoken a while ago about the clearsquare portal, right? Yeah. Did you find out how it's being used? And if there are external customers that access the Domo data?
Shivam M: What, like I discussed this with Shannon but not on the depth that do we have clearsquare license or not? Apart from the usage of the reports, we have embedded this Domo report to a platform, right? I don't remember the platform because I never go to that, but yes, we are using that embedded report feature. So few of our clients, they only have access to that particular platform, which have like specific, three to four reports. They access those reports directly from there, download the PDF and work their stuff.
Nik K: Okay. That's great. So, and these are just property managers who are accessing their reports.
Shivam M: Yes. Like few, a couple of them, like I believe like 15, 20 of them are using that portal. So, they have like four reports which they usually use, that includes work orders and these budget things. So they go there, they just download their weekly report and then they, you know, forward it to subordinates or, you know, team members.
Nik K: Okay. And this is, these are the same ones that Shannon was talking about last week. I think you also mentioned that they have all.
Shivam M: No, the thing is that both of them, like those are our employees who are actually using that external platform where doma reports are emitted. And Shannon at present, she's talking about our client mjw?
Nik K: Oh, okay.
Shivam M: So those are our employees. And like the other one is declined, okay?
Nik K: Okay. Understood. So I guess in that case, if they are being embedded in this other portal, do you know if they added as users in doma or?
Shivam M: No, they are not added as users in doma. No, no, no. Oh, okay. And not, so in our entire redstone is also not added as a user in doma, like very specific persons being added like at least VPS, avps and director level.
Nik K: Okay. So then I would guess if you've embedded that somewhere, I think that's where clearsquare must be used because they need to authenticate, somehow, right? So if it's not in doma, they must be authenticating through clearsquare. Okay. That's my guess, but I mean, as you understand, right? Because it is a license you're paying for and we wanted to set you up, you know, one of our items is to help you set up clearsquare and any new portals or any new shareable dashboards. Okay. So, yeah, just fyi, I mean, I know we're not there yet at that step of setting those up. But yeah… I don't know who manages clearsquare, but that might help you identify where it's being used. So.
Shivam M: Yes, I'll definitely after this call, I'll like tomorrow, I'm going to have a call with Shannon. I'll discuss this thoroughly with her ",Consumption Pricing Model,44071.95,Corporate,REDSTONERESIDENTIAL.COM,7,Other,308,$5M to <$10M,Renewal,Blank,2: Determine Needs,Bria Rogers,2026-06-17,2025-06-18,2025-06-18,,,,,,0013800001C0Qy3AAF

How are you?
Mackenzie E: Hey, Simon. How's it going?
Simon N: So good. Hey, Simon, good to see you. It's been.
Theodore F: A little bit good to see you too. Yeah, we thought we lost, you thought you were no longer on our account after the last call out.
Simon N: Of my cold dead hands, I'll let go of the Corbin account. No, I was out on vacation last week, a family trip down to northern California?
Mackenzie E: Oh, nice. Nice.
Simon N: I'll never miss another call. Have you guys had any fun vacations this summer?
Mackenzie E: Nope.
Theodore F: I went to yosemite for a few days, which was cool. Oh, sweet. Did a backpacking trip out there?
Simon N: Nice. How many nights?
Theodore F: We did four nights out there. Oh, wow. We did a long one. Yeah, we went as far out as we could. Did a big loop. So it was good. Yeah, me and my brother went what?
Simon N: Was the route called?
Theodore F: It's the Clark range. I think it's called like red peak pass loop. Okay. That might bring it up on like all trails or something.
Simon N: Sweet. Oh, yeah. It's like some lakes.
Theodore F: Yeah. We went a little early, so we caught some snow going over the pass, which was a little worse than we expected. But other than that, it was beautiful. You really don't see anybody out there when you get like five Miles from a trailhead, out there. No one, no tourists are going that far.
Simon N: That's the best part about backpacking for sure. It's like you get a little, you hit like that five mile mark, and all of a sudden, you got it to yourself. Yeah.
Theodore F: I saw like two people out there, crazy where'd you go in northern California.
Simon N: I was in the Trinity alps wilderness at Trinity lake. So, it's like northwest of lake Shasta… and a lot less folks in lake Shasta.
Theodore F: Which is great. Wow, that's awesome. Was it?
Simon N: Hard to get a permit to backpack in yosemite?
Theodore F: No, it's honestly, not as hard as everyone kind of people make it sound if you book it like a month in advance or so or if you try to use their lottery, it's pretty easy also like people cancel usually the day of so you can, if you go to their office, you can usually find one.
Simon N: Very cool. That's cool. That they do that. If someone knows shows that they give, they're like give that permit back up that's I wish more outdoor recreation opportunities. Did.
Theodore F: That, yeah, you just got to hope that they, you have to wait till 10 a. M. So you got to hope it's a trail you actually want, but there's a good chance. Oh, that's cool. Yosemite's cool. Because like you can get to most of the places you want to via multiple trails. So like it's more so like, am I going to take a detour or not?
Simon N: Yeah. So the permit's for where you start? Yeah, yeah, exactly. Oh, very cool. Mackenzie. You'll have to bring your little one out for a backpacking trip. That doesn't sound like too much work.
Theodore F: You just have to carry him for 15 Miles. Lovely once they get tired.
Mackenzie E: We'll certainly spend my pto.
Theodore F: Yeah, hiking through the woods.
Mackenzie E: Yeah. With my three year old.
Theodore F: Yes, I'm having it. Yeah, I've noticed it's not really an appealing activity for a lot of people. Yeah. So try to convince them.
Simon N: Well, I'm jealous. Sounds like a good time.
Theodore F: Yeah, it was awesome. Cool to hear about it. I highly recommend that route if you're able to.
Ankit S: You were just out there, right? Shane? Is that correct? Yeah, Shane, sorry, I don't know if you heard, sorry, you were just out there.
Shane W: I was in yellowstone, not yosemite.
Ankit S: I'm sorry, yellowstone that's right? Got the wrong one. Yeah.
Shane W: Yellowstone, at least the way I did it is sitting in the car, driving around, not like… yosemite. Yosemite, is awesome though. I was there a year ago or so and we rented bikes and just rode around and hiked up and saw some waterfalls. I can't remember the names of them, but I wouldn't want to hike up that with a three year old.
Mackenzie E: You know what? Shane you and me, we would have a good vacation. Simon and Teddy can do their own thing.
Shane W: I did hike up there's. A, sorry, I know we don't have very much time, but just one story I had my youngest or my oldest was young at the time and we, it was July fourth super hot and there's this trail called tipinogas cave. And you go up this hike up, it's like 2000 feet. Maybe it's not that high but it's very high. It seems very high. And then at the top, there's this cave and they're like you go through the cave, you got to bring like jackets because it's really cold in the cave. So we're outside and it's like 100 degrees, but we all have like winter parkas essentially to take when we get into the cave. And so I have my daughter and she's just little and carrying her up. And then, oh, and my wife had a brand new baby and we're going up and people, it's the first time we had done it and people were walking down and people kept saying, good luck, guys. And we're like, what are you talking about? And then we're about three quarters of the way up and we're just dying and my daughter is just like she's just like beside herself. She's super hot and she takes off her shirt and then puts on her big winter coat anyways. We were carrying all this stuff and we get up there and we go through the cave and it was like in the cave, it was the perfect temperature. We didn't need any coats or anything. So we carried all this stuff up so high and we didn't need any of it. It, was, it was miserable and I'm I do not. Every time I walk up that hill, I just always think of that experience and I, it's an ingrained memory but not a great memory anyways.
Mackenzie E: Generational trauma.
Shane W: Yes, for me and for my kids, but yeah, anyways, Utah's great for there's a lot of outdoor stuff here. All right. So we, I know we want to talk about the AI like file system for that. I'm not prepared to talk about that today, so we can talk about that next time, but I wanted to talk about the pro code editor and how we can create like our own charts and things like that for you guys.

Phil S: Doing pretty good, man. How about yourself?
Todd B: Not too bad week's almost over. Yes. Sorry to push you guys out to Friday afternoon. I know that's nobody's favorite.
Benjamin P: That's okay. It's not even my last meeting of the day.
Todd B: Okay. There you go. It's.
Phil S: not even our last meeting with home depot either. Oh.
Todd B: Okay. Good. Well, there you go. Then. I don't feel so bad.
Phil S: Yeah, yeah. Actually, we do have a hard stop at this 30 minutes because then we're hopping on with the AI team within product engineering is also kind of in that instance, doing some trials as well.
Todd B: Okay. Well, that's good. So, my thought was I pulled in some spreadsheets just to get an understanding of whether or not I'm doing anything the right way or thinking about it the right way. I just uploaded that into the system. So I don't know if you guys can see.
Benjamin P: That, this is homedepot. Trial. Demo. Com, and this is the one that we moved over to GCP. Right? Bill. Yeah… let me see.
Todd B: Can I share my screen too?
Benjamin P: It's all right. Yeah, we can play it.
Todd B: Do I have weekend plans? Yeah, not too much. I'm back here in Arkansas this weekend. So just hanging out with my family and then back to Atlanta on Monday morning.
Benjamin P: There you go. I've flown over Arkansas, but never landed there.
Todd B: Yeah, yeah. I think that's probably most people right? Fly over it and never actually spend any time here.
Benjamin P: Oh, all right. Yeah. So, I'm in here. I do see a DDDD pdi dataset.
Todd B: Yeah, yeah.
Benjamin P: Got 225 rows, 25 columns.
Todd B: Yeah. And so the one thing here and I'll just let me just share. Can you guys see my screen?
Benjamin P: I can.
Todd B: So, my thought on it and you guys, this is the first thing that I did, you correct me if I'm wrong because I know before when I was looking at bringing in different or like having different, a lot of different columns and, you know, for example, you could have, well, let me start at the beginning. So, I'm going back to this paint desk initiative because I think it's the easier thing for me to understand quickly. So, I'm going back to that. And the idea was here, pull in all of the different classes that we have in paint. So, classes… are, you know, types of products, right? So, you got, I mean, all kinds of different stuff in here. And I got, I wanted to break down sales in units across all of the different market or regions that we have in home depot. Okay. So I have all the regions here, all the dollars broken out. And rather than doing it all in one spreadsheet, where I have, you know, Q3 in a group of columns, and then Q4 in a group of columns, and then, you know, Q1 this year and Q2 in a bunch of columns, I made different. I made different spreadsheets essentially for different tabs for all of them. So, like this is Q3 sales, then I have, the same rows, Q4 sales, same rows, Q1 sales, same row, Q2 sales. And then I got units the same. And then I got last four quarters dollars, last four quarters units. And so, is that the, is that the better way to put it together? Or should I have just put them all in under, like the different columns?
Benjamin P: Tell me, of these tabs that you have here, which cause we have data in, you have data in the instance right now, the data that's in the instance right now, is this just one of these tabs?
Todd B: Yeah, it should be, it should be all of those tabs. From what I saw in the instance that I put in all of the tabs uploaded?
Benjamin P: Okay. Let's see created date is the oldest. So, I've got one dataset that has 225 rows. How many rows does this Q3 tab? How many rows does it have?
Todd B: 249.
Benjamin P: Okay. So, I'm only seeing one dataset in here. I'm not seeing.
Todd B: Okay. You're not seeing like the different, all the different tabs?
Benjamin P: Nope. Okay. So when you upload, when you upload a spreadsheet, so, let's start here. If you, exit out at the top.
Todd B: Exit out of this. Yeah.
Benjamin P: Yeah. So when you went to upload the spreadsheet, show me what you did. Okay? When you uploaded the spreadsheet to demo?
Todd B: So I went to data file upload, and then I pulled in this file.
Benjamin P: Okay. Yep. So just let's just do that. Again, Qlik on that.
Todd B: Okay. Hang on. I gotta close this.
Benjamin P: So, one thing it's going to do is it's going to choose one sheet. So you see that drop down that says sheet Q3.
Todd B: Yeah.
Benjamin P: And so that's just gonna pull in that one sheet. Okay? And so it pulled in that one sheet and that what we're seeing in there is likely the Q3 because it's gonna default to that first one. So, if you were to do this for each of those sheets. So since we know we already have Q3, we can then choose Q4. The alternative would have been to get every bit of data on the same sheet and upload it at one time. But you don't have to do it that way, you can put your spreadsheet together however you want to. We can bring in those multiple data sets, and then we can use magic ETL to join all the data together so that we have everything in one data set because we're gonna have to use ETL magic ETL anyway to clean this data up a little bit. And so I think it's perfectly fine to pull these in separately.
Todd B: So, could I have put in the columns? I could have just put in the different time frames with sales, for example. Like, so I could have had sales, Q3, Q4, Q1, Q2, all in the same spreadsheet. Okay? I thought there was a problem when I had like different levels in the columns. So like I have sales dollars and quarters, you know? So I thought that I had to have them all like just one, you know, like just one metric in the columns.
Benjamin P: The good thing about magic ETL is you can bring the data in as messy as you'd like it to be okay, and we can clean it up inside of demo. So, you know, with it not being organized in a way that's you know, conducive to data visualization, that's okay, because magic ETL is going to bridge that gap. And so, you know, we've got qtree, if you want to modify, I don't know if you want to modify your spreadsheet.

Vu N: Yep. Eric. Hey, how's it going?
Aishwarya D: Good morning.
Eric G: Hey, I've got Brian working on something else right now. So he's not going to join. So we can probably just get started now.
Vu N: That works.
Aishwarya D: Okay.
Eric G: All right. So, where do we want to start, ash? Do we want to start with some of the balance sheet metrics or do you want to go over the email I sent last night and if there are any questions there, which is more on the PL stuff like what would be best?
Aishwarya D: I think we can start with the email because we went ahead and made most of the changes that were mentioned. So, just want to be on the same page.
Eric G: Okay. Cool. All right. Do you want to share? I don't have it up right now. It might be easier for you to drive.
Aishwarya D: Yes, I can do that. Let me know once you see my screen.
Eric G: I got it.
Aishwarya D: So, I know the first one was regarding the budget. It wasn't tying up. Now. It is because we hadn't excluded the nulls from group. Okay. So it should look good. Now, is that what you were talking about when you mentioned about the budget and some being understated?
Eric G: Well, it doesn't look right? I mean, the revenue looks better. Let me pull the numbers up, but just like first glance, it doesn't look right? Okay. Let me see. Yeah, like operating profit year to date would not be 98,000,000. Like even the budget, I don't think it would be pulled… up. Maybe I'm wrong. No, yeah, we should be at like 40… two point six. So like it still looks overstated. The revenue looks right? The gross profit looks close.
Aishwarya D: Oh, oh,
Eric G: operating expenses looks like we're off.
Aishwarya D: Sorry, I think this is not calculating properly because this is negative 30 got.
Eric G: It.
Aishwarya D: it should still be 80. Yeah, it's considering it, but okay, we can.
Eric G: Yeah, it's just for the number. And again, I don't know how to fix this because it looked like it was off for all groups, okay?
Aishwarya D: But.
Eric G: operating expenses should be 112 point two year to date, June. In fact, like it's kind of strange actuals look off too. Okay. I'm missing the vertical. It should be 120 point six. The actuals are right? So anyway, it's off by like 50,000,000. So, something's going on. I wonder if there's like a certain opex like PL line that's not being included in that or something? Okay. Let's check each of those. Yeah, see like compensation and benefits should be like… well, I don't have it broken out for Astra, but it should be at least like 80,000,000. Oh.
Aishwarya D: Oh, you're talking about the budget?
Eric G: Yeah, the budget?
Aishwarya D: Let me quickly check here as well.
Eric G: Yeah. Up here, this is what was confusing me is up here, it looks fine. I think unless something changed, yeah, they're 122 point eight, that is close. It's not exactly right. But it's close.
Aishwarya D: It is… 122.
Eric G: Vu, were you going to say something? Sorry, I didn't mean to cut you off.
Vu N: Yeah. What's… the difference between? That card and? Oh, never mind. Actuals versus budget and the card above is actuals… versus prior year.
Eric G: That's right? Yeah. And those looked, I think pretty good. I can't remember what my notes were on that, if there were any issues, but I think it was close.
Aishwarya D: Okay. But it should match to the card here, right? Yeah.
Eric G: Those two things should tie. So, if there's anything different, this card and the other one like that's, got to be what the issue is.
Aishwarya D: Yes, I had looked and it was the note, but I'll have a look.
Vu N: Sorry about that. That's.
Eric G: okay. Again, I think the rest looks okay. And then, did you see my note on Ge mechanical? Let's see if that, I don't know if you had a chance to fix that yet, which impacts both sections. I think it impacts, yeah, year to date budget.
Aishwarya D: We discussed that, and we have Brian on the call in one of the calls. We discussed that if we exclude and I think Vu, you were also there, if we exclude the Ge mechanical and aliots that we do for intact, not for excel. Is that right?
Vu N: Go ahead.
Eric G: Vu.
Vu N: So, the excel and the excel financial package there… are like elimination entities for Ge mechanical services that are not in intact… but in intact, what I have done is since those eliminations are not in there, I've excluded Elliott's and Ge met services… and that has seemed to tie out with the Ge numbers?
Eric G: Here scroll up, aish, just so I can like reorient myself on what I was saying here. So, Aquila group, year to date, revenue budget?
Vu N: Why does this look weird? What am I missing here?
Eric G: Give me one sec. Let me make sure… I'm looking at the same slide.
Vu N: Thank you.
Eric G: Yeah, something? Okay. Maybe it's fixed now. I'm trying to look back at what my. The year to date budget number is 7,000,000 high for Aquila group. I'm trying to remember exactly what the issue is because it looks fine now. Oh, maybe it was, hold on. Maybe it was actual, yes, I said budget. I think I meant actuals. So like, you see how year to date, Cy says 101,000,000?
Aishwarya D: No.
Eric G: Our excel has 94 point 5,000,000. But like the… year to date, the month to date looks okay. And so, anyway, I figured out that difference is Aquila… group. I don't know how we pronounce it and it's Ge mechanical services is exactly 7,000,000 in actuals… year to date. So, maybe it's the other way around, like maybe it needs to be included. Maybe that's what it?
Aishwarya D: Is currently it's included?
Eric G: It is included?
Aishwarya D: Okay. Yeah. You're not excluding anything. So, if I exclude.
Eric G: But this isn't the right one. So, there's two Ge mechanicals, there's Ge mechanical and Ge mechanical services. Okay?
Aishwarya D: Let's check. Was it?
Vu N: That's an apple? Yeah.

Robert B: Hi, Sarah. How are you?
Sarah C: Doing well. How are you? I'm.
Robert B: good. I haven't spoken to you for some time but yeah, I want to make sure that everyone knew that I'm still here if there's some necessities and make sure that I'm at least in touch with things. I realize that there hasn't been a lot of stuff that's required me that's fine.
Sarah C: Yeah, I think we're getting to the point where we're going to start PDP after launch in mid to late September.
Robert B: Cool. Are you looking at that PDP implementation as being pretty wide scale that you're going to need some automation to get it up and running and things like that or you just want to get some guidance on it and just kind of manually put it in for yourself?
Sarah C: No idea. I don't know.
Robert B: Fair enough. All right. Well, we'll cross that bridge. Is Jaran going to be here today?
Sarah C: I hope so. Yeah, he's here.
Robert B: Oh, hi, Jaran, I'm sorry, I didn't know that you were here.
Jaran P: I just joined.
Robert B: Hi, Jaran, I haven't spoken with you for a few weeks either. So I wanted to let you know. I'm still of interest and, you know, I'm still interested in this project and that if you have some needs, I'll try to make myself available. I'm going to have more availability over the next weeks. I've been very unavailable for the previous four. So.
Sarah C: Fine. Yes, I think we will be. And Robert, I kind of think this probably relates more to you. I don't know if it really, I don't know who does this, but we will be integrating with Salesforce before the end of the year and we're going to do it either in Germany or UK, likely UK first. And so then I will need to start incorporating after we launch next week, start incorporating probably within the week or so after our, his name is Raj for our it department that's like our Salesforce person.
Robert B: Right.
Sarah C: So, we'll need to get him connected with whoever to start doing that match pair.
Robert B: Okay. I definitely can step into that. I think Jaran actually is very comfortable with that too. So Jaran's kind of held this thing. I'm going to let him take the lead if he feels like he wants me to take that on. Fine, if he feels like he's got it.
Jaran P: No, I think Robert, I think you should just take that on. I don't have the first API experience. So, our connectors here, so.
Robert B: Salesforce is always interesting, you really, you know, and I really appreciate what you said about bringing Raj in because it doesn't matter how much time I have in. Salesforce is so built for each customer that when you look at the way that reports are done in Salesforce and the data, I'll get this big list of data sets in Salesforce and there's going to be interconnectivity or relationships between them. And you can't see that in our reporting in our connecting tool, you can't see that account is connected over here or something else. And so on. So it gets to be, you know, it gets to be a challenge where somebody who works with Salesforce and works with the data, knows what those mean and knows how things there might relate. So, case in point, we just had a customer that had Salesforce and they, and… without the Salesforce person, we, the people from our team did the best they could and they built a very overly complex set of interconnections of multiple data sets together. And it made things really hard to kind of work with in the ETL and they didn't need to be, it was actually when we got with the person, we brought it down to like 20 columns and it was all good. It was, it was a short lived and short process and then all the data they needed was there. And so, you know, that's because somebody knew the relationships that we don't get to see very easily in Salesforce.
Sarah C: Perfect. Yeah. And we're just building to launch it in the UK and Germany. So we can kind of make sure that all the fields we need will integrate. And then I was thinking Jaran, if they're missing a data field, like let's say they have no idea how much the equipment the laser equipment at this practice cost, right? They just don't know we'll just put in benchmarks and then the sales reps can adjust the benchmark numbers as they learn more about the account. So that's what I'm thinking.
Jaran P: Yeah, that works. So is the goal for Salesforce to replace the input forms?
Sarah C: Ideally. Yes.
Jaran P: Yeah, makes sense. Okay, cool.
Sarah C: And then we'll still have both ways to do it because there's going to be people that won't get Salesforce because we have a lot of distributors as well.
Jaran P: Yeah, got it. Okay.
Sarah C: It's going to be, it will be a mixed bag of people. So I just can't believe they're still investing and rolling out Salesforce at this company, but that's fine. It's not my, it's not my decision. Yeah. So, so that's one I did meet this morning with the, distributor countries include France, Poland, Czech, Republic, the nordics, Belgium. I guess anyways, the others, yeah, this morning and so I sent them all their benchmark information. They're very intrigued. I think probably, I told them we don't need to do this before next week, but ideally, we'll probably get those countries to build the next in the next week or after within two weeks.
Jaran P: Yeah, absolutely. I think we have a pretty good process in place. So once we can get the benchmarks and if any translations, then we can do it.
Sarah C: Yeah. I think the only translation we're going to be required to have is France because it's legally you're required to translate all material into French, but everybody else, it says they're fine with English.
Jaran P: Okay. Nice. Yeah, yeah.
Sarah C: Exactly. So, and then we'll just have to change currency for like kroner or whatever all those yeah things are.
Jaran P: What would be good is, I guess when they do the benchmarks, if they can just confirm the currency symbol, just so we're not trying to like search online and try to figure something out.
Sarah C: I agree. When I sent out the benchmark form to him today, I was like, please confirm currency symbols and location. So I was like, yeah, we've learned something there.

The group also explored options for archiving and compressing Domo's large dataset to reduce storage requirements, including the possibility of storing the data in OneDrive or a cloud platform. The conversation focused on finding a long-term storage solution and streamlining Domo's data management processes.","William M: Wayne, I got this weird mystery meeting about gas price apis. Okay? And it was, I think he's with mohawk. Well, I know they're with mohawk because it's Engie data… but he's trying to use Power BI to read their API and then parse out the, I think it's pricing forecast data. And… of course, he's a tad challenging to understand. And he's going in a bit of circles and I don't know when he's looking at the Engie interface or when it's Power BI because I'm not used to Power BI. So finally, I was like, if you'll send me the Json response from the API, I'll see if I can parse it into something that you can do something with, but understand guys, I've never worked with Power BI. It didn't exist when I started on Domo and I didn't look back. Yeah. So… we'll see what I get and I'm not sure really what all their issues are.
Wayne W: And what ultimately are they trying to do with it?
William M: Oh, they're trying to like see a trend line for, and it might be individual plants they're referring to at this point. But Henry, something was one of them Henry house, I think is one of them and it's… like monthly min, max pricing… so… that they can do a trend comparison. And then they want to be able to compare Henry to, I don't know waddle or something like that… but they've got maybe they're looking at like a 10 year trend and… I can't… remember how many points they had… but it turned out to be a bunch. And then they were like, how are we ending up with a 1,000,000 plus rows for this? And I'm like, yeah, you should have like 6,000 base. So, I don't know it was very weird.
Wayne W: Okay.
William M: But we'll see what the Json looks like. Yeah… they get from the API.
Wayne W: Okay. All right. Hey, everybody. Awesome. Hi, everyone. Good morning. Hello? Shane. Hello, Dylan… Shane, where would you like to start today?
Shane W: Yeah. So I'll kind of just jump in and share… my screen here. Just kind of a couple things to go over. So I think I was able to pull the stacker app back. Does this look familiar?
William M: Yeah, I don't know if those are let's see sales motor. Yeah. Is that all? Oh, there's some additional ones down below, right? Yeah. Okay. But they all say test that's. Weird. We should have our sales… OK?
Shane W: Potentially, so, I went, let's see cells. Let's see what? Are either of these, the cells' data?
William M: That doesn't look like it, no.
Shane W: OK. Let's see if there's another app here. Let's see here. Do these ones look?
William M: Like it?
Shane W: OK. So there's a couple.
William M: Of versions.
Shane W: So, I must have grabbed, the wrong one but I'll move this one over to that page.
William M: And it does look like some of those other ones were running, so.
Shane W: Yeah, I don't know what the crossover is between those between the two. In terms of… that, the scene that.
William M: I'm thinking, can we do like a stack or two page… so that we have, yeah, just so we can see.
Shane W: I was just going to put that one down here below. Yeah. Let's see here. How do I get that one to… show up?
William M: Data?
Shane W: Sender… not sure what the difference is between data assembler and stacker. Is… that's probably what these two one is for the stacker. This one's probably the… one's data similar one stacker, and I don't know what's what the difference is between those. But we'll put them both on the same page. All right. So, I mean, one thing as I was talking to people about this is the person… who developed stacker and the idea of stacker initially and kind of created this before we had other tools. He's no longer with Domo. And so I don't know how much longer this will be kind of maintained in this state and not that it's like something that's imminent that we need to resolve. But I just think over time there'll be fewer and fewer people I went and talked to support initially about this and they were like, yeah, I don't we would just send questions to this person who's left. And so now that and they're like we haven't we don't get a lot of questions. So anyways, I'm saying this because I just think fewer and fewer people are using this and it's going to not be really supported. So, I think that I, that the best idea here would be to go through this and say, okay, what do we, what do we actually care about and let's recreate, these stackers inside of magic ETL, which are, very simple to do. And I don't know what you guys… are like how complicated all these are, but we should be able, to fairly easily move them over to the to magic and just use the partition and, it will update all of it, will update it fairly quickly. So, I think that would be the way that I would suggest that we handle this going forward and that alleviates having to go in here and kind of be fill out these forms and I'll be able to just go into magic ETL, and build out, the, that process in there. So.
William M: How do we get magic ETL to point to our… existing?
Shane W: Data.
William M: sets. Yeah, yeah.
Shane W: And when we have it up and going, I can go and I have there someone in support can go and make those transitions for us, and they can do it on the back end. If we really can't do it on the front end so that we have to, when we know which ones we want to do. We'll we'll test with one, make sure it works, right? And then we can have them, do the other ones.
William M: Okay.
Shane W: Yeah, and then we can kind of just put… all these on pause, and then remove them eventually. Yeah. So I think that would be what I would suggest and I think we'd probably be in a pretty good spot, to do that. Any… other questions on this? And I guess that and I'll just suggest that we probably wait to do this till later and make that a after we do a cleanup and then we can kind of go in, and adjust the stacker data flows.
William M: Okay. Yeah, that seems reasonable.
Shane W: Great. And then the other thing I worked on was just… let's see here. Just creating a data sets for deletion and I, and I put together a high level like what I typically have seen in terms of like grading, these data sets.

I'm making, I'm gonna make some lists for you guys of like, you know, hey, we want to kind of get rid of like these branches that are along like the main flow, but, you know, that has like an effect all the way down. So it's a whole bunch of little changes that would need to happen to remove some of that old data. And I'm working on getting all the DTC stuff correct, but really we're gonna have you pop up all the dashboards and make the apps too. If you can do this pretty good. I can do the back.

Ali K: Yeah.
Jenna H: Okay. All.
Ali K: Right. So, what?
Jenna H: I really love to talk about is I know you said Heather, that, you know, we're you're doing a lot of the cleanup in terms of the back end and one share has been a Domo customer. It's.
Ali K: like, yeah.
Jenna H: It's… it's been, is when it's it looked like in our reporting system that there was… when it started. Do you remember anything about the implementation process for you there? When it was implemented originally everything?
Heather H: In here?
Jenna H: Okay. Do you remember how long it took for you to implement a?
Heather H: Year. I mean, it was constantly and, I mean I spent a lot of time and combining multiple systems. I mean, it was month after month and then adding more stuff. So, I mean I was constantly in it and that's part of the problem. So, like even now we just changed to a new system, right? And so before when I had to merge dates, we had to look at like Hubspot when it came to like internal sales and what the closed days, what for that? Like the closed date, right? Well, then basically, they wouldn't even get into Salesforce until the like next day or sometimes even like three days later because we had like a third party. Now, we've got Salesforce processing these. So the closed date will be the same date, right? So if I just go and combine all that and then we have the admin data that has a whole different set of dates, right? Then everything that we've ever reported so far is now wrong and shifts and everyone's going to look back at certain dates and say, hey, this isn't what I had in a report like a year ago and it's like, well, I just changed the dates over the new structure. So it's a lot of little things like that. That'll never be 100 percent and we just kind of have to be like, this is what it is, right? And so it's just migrating system after system and none of them really add up that's really what I'm dealing with. Okay?
Jenna H: So, it's new systems with the new systems, the business rules in terms of like which date fields and this system apply to that system and time to process and all that stuff getting that lined up. Okay. Yeah, that's always a major challenge and it's always hard to like especially where folks are so used to static reports and being able to go in and like pull up, you know, the PDF from a year ago. And then you go into a visualization tool which depending on how it's structured could be real realer time. So when these changes are made, it reflects the new date philosophy or it can be set up where it can almost like snapshot it and freeze it. But if there's a discrepancy, of course, that opens up the door for a little bit of user distrust and not sure what the right answer is and what they want to believe, which is something I, we talked a little bit about last time and really working on trying to find a way to help kind of align everything.

Tyson S: Good. How are you?
William W: I'm not bad at all. I'm not bad at all.

William W: I think on your end, so it just depends if you're the reason why I was saying we could do it at zoom is I have a troubleshooting like guide and I can talk to you. Some people are very like precious with their back end stuff, and I certainly don't want to get access to your Salesforce, like your crma data. So I'll run it however you would prefer. I'm good.

Tyson S: Cool. All right. I think you should be able to see my Salesforce instance. I hope.
William W: Yes, sir. Okay. So the first thing we have to do is make sure that you're using the Salesforce license… type that allows API. So if you go into setup and then company information, and then you'll go organization edition. Okay?
Tyson S: Yeah, I think I told you on the call that we have the cheapest version. So I wouldn't be surprised if we find out I do not.
William W: Well, and that's Salesforce to you too. They'll take the most basic stuff and charge a 1,000,000 bucks for it or else they're not going to give it to you.
Tyson S: So, what was that? Once I got the company information, what was next?
William W: It's going to be organization edition. We're trying to see if you have an organization edition that's called… if it's essentials or professional without API.
Tyson S: Professional without API, just professional.
William W: That's where you're at?
Tyson S: Yeah, right here.
William W: Okay. You'd need access from Salesforce. Let's see, connect to app policy and scopes. let's see. So, is there try to search, did you search for the word API on this page and see if there's any or maybe up in the search bar in the top left? Just see if API is API request limit?
Tyson S: Down here. It's got some. Okay?
William W: So that's good. So, and there's multiple ways to skin the cat for the record. So the API is obviously like the most industry standard, so to speak API. Asians. So it looks like you do have API capabilities. So that shouldn't be a problem. I'm going to proceed as if you do. And then we run into something along the way then. Okay. So in setup, go to app manager. It wants me to double check that you have the highest permissions. I'm going to assume that you do based on what you said in the meeting the other day?
Tyson S: Yeah, we can check it, but I should.
William W: Yeah.
Tyson S: I'm at app manager, I guess I clicked on that. I don't know what you want next.
William W: Oh, sorry. Okay. Yeah. So find connected app. So in app manager, Domo is right there. Okay? And it says connected manage. So Qlik into that and then go to manage and edit policies. Okay? Manage edit policies, all users. So permitted users, all… users may self authorize. Okay, IP relaxation lacks IP restrictions. So let's go to relax IP restrictions on that, and then refresh token policy. I don't see that on there. I think right here. Oh, yeah. Sorry. Okay. Refresh token is valid until revoked?
Tyson S: Yeah.
William W: Perfect. And then oauth scopes, do you guys use oauth on Salesforce where it does like crazy back end stuff.
Tyson S: Not that I know of.
William W: Okay. I'm going to see you locked in through M to F a, where it like tells your cell phone like, hey, are you sure about this? Yeah. So that's M to F a, oauth is like a heavy duty layer where you like pack all your stuff behind it and it, you know, it's like Okta, or something. Okay? So we should be good on that.

William W: Yeah. Qlik that just so I can see what's in there… connected oauth. Okay. All right. We'll just, we shall proceed. I think I would have seen an oauth screen or would sometimes you'll see what's called sso, you don't think?
Tyson S: I need to do this install button.
William W: Let's connect it out. Yeah. I see other ones with it. Let's try it. Let's do it… install connected install… shoot. Maybe this was the blocker. Okay? And then it kicked you back over here. Connected apps, oauth usage is now underneath on the top left side. Cool. It switched you over to classic view, which is interesting. It does that sometimes. Okay? So we're good on that.
Tyson S: Does this whole oauth custom scopes matter?
William W: Yeah. Let's check that out on the scopes access and manage your data. Let's Qlik it. And then I think we can undo it if it's ooh, this looks fancy back out. Yeah, let's back out. Okay? And we're recording this. So we need to undo anything which I feel confidently we're not going to need to.
Tyson S: But I'm okay. I don't mind poking around like this?
William W: Okay. Cool. So re, authenticate in Domo with corrective main. So let's go over to Domo. And then we're going to go to data center. Yeah, you know what you're doing?
Tyson S: Connectors.
William W: Let's go over to the little cube at the top first. And then I actually saw Salesforce in here, but you can't Qlik on it. I did try. It says there's a data set, but I couldn't find anything, which is strange to me. Yeah, I tried all that and it doesn't populate up here. So I don't know if it's like a false flag or something cool. Yeah, I couldn't find anything on there. It's weird that it's over on the left. Like maybe you guys hit it at one point and then you turned it off or something I'm not sure. Sort by, oh, nevermind that's not a filter that's a sort key. Okay, cool. So let's go to data set in Domo. Qlik on the… let me see. Let's try to connect again.

The team also highlighted specific use cases and logos that showcase Domo's capabilities, such as the work done for US Bank and PlayStation, and discussed the format for presenting these case studies to Dale.","Michael N: hey, just got off with our deal desk. I was able to do the contract amendment, right? Considering the first time I put it through, it was rejected before I even hit send.
Dale W: That's impressive. I must have taken some tips from this. Ae, I've been dealing with all day.
Michael N: I tried to put it in as just a regular quote and it just immediately got rejected.
Dale W: Nice.
Michael N: And it should. And when I thought about it because Kim felt got back to me, she's amazing and I said, do I need to do this as an amendment? She said yes because it follows their anniversary dates. Then I said, okay.
Dale W: Nice. So, you know, that on the water, yes.
Michael N: We have regional one which is, you know, app development platform. We do a bunch of work for them. Is that big enough? Dale? Ups?
Jace M: Yeah. Well, we, I mean, there's a lot of logos. I think we can use it's. The question is, do we get specific in talking about the use cases that are similar to, you know, what Dale's looking to highlight, right? Yeah.
William D: Dale, sorry, I'm not. Sorry, chase and Mike for being late but Dale, I'm sorry.
Jace M: It's all right. I'll just order something extra expensive. Next time you're buying. What a surprise. That way it goes on your expense report, not mine. Oh, shoot, we started recording, didn't we.
William D: the funniest part is Dale, then I'll get back to businesses. We've had some realignments, so there's changes, but all the expense report from the other team continues to come to me and I keep looking at it and I go, boy, you guys are having a great time on?
Jace M: My.
Michael N: budget.
Jace M: nice.
Dale W: Now, we know where the pro AI chargers are coming from. All right now, it's all full disclosure. Got it. I.
William D: need that. Sorry?
Jace M: Yeah. So, yeah. So I think there's a couple of things you know, that you maybe want to look at highlighting. And again, it's you know, we obviously have some pretty big logos that we can throw on there. We can just throw on logos for logo's sake, but also talk about specifically like what are we doing for them? Yeah. And how is that different than just visualization, right?
Dale W: Yeah. I mean, anything, any logo, and I think back to maybe it's specialized which you guys do, which you guys have a front end portal and you're pulling things through, right? And they're turning data into a product that's hosting back out, right? That's anything that allows the product ring to happen or the enterprise pillar across because I think of the Sony kind of the playstation thing of just being able to navigate the complexity of their space and all of that, that's something that no other logo and your competitor logo could handle. So, those types of things are just expansiveness, right?
Jace M: Yeah. Us bank is another big one, right? And they're aries, I don't know if you ever, if you saw that at DP or not what they're doing with aries, it's basically like they have like thousands of people whose only job is to use an app written in Domo that's their job, that's how they interact with their high network individuals.
Dale W: Oh, that was the emmy stuff that she was working on from us bank. Yep. Okay.
Jace M: Yep. Yeah. So I think that's a good one. First of all, it's a nice logo. And second, it talks about the fact that like the use case is really app hosting on Domo, right? So like they're using this as a transactional system and that's a good story there as well. Playstation obviously would be a good one too. Adam probably knows some more. We've got God.
Dale W: Oh,
William D: Riley uses this wall to wall. We're in all groups of Riley, right? We're finance, we're store operations, we're everything.
Jace M: Yeah, we're doing some cool stuff. Oh, I'm not going to call it. I started a group here a minute ago.
William D: What's the goal though? Dale? I just want to hear it from you what you need or what you're looking for.
Dale W: Well, I think this opportunity is really to kind of hit what we've built out for health and the end to end wall to wall, whichever you want to call it. The view of not only just warehousing ETL and viz, but apps and all of that space. Omnicom is trying to piecemeal things together especially in their elements of kind of content supply chain and all of the stuff that they're trying to roll out enterprise wide. And then they're buying tools like a scoping tool that's 700 plus dollars per user per year type of thing. And you're like you guys just take what we have lift and shift it over you're talking about 10 K versus 700 dollars a seat type of thing. Yeah, you know, take some of our stuff for free and then this is what you get.
Jace M: Yeah. So us bank, we also have discount tire, optum, uhg, ally… the universal GSK, there's another one. We could talk about Dale and I don't know if this is of interest to you.
William D: Ally's a good one.
Jace M: We're working, yeah, because it's staffing too, right?
William D: Worldwide staffing too, it's worldwide.
Jace M: Oh, yeah, yeah. Yeah. But I'm saying that that's yeah, because of what, you know, Dale's done some of that too, right? Like how do we staff the engagements? So that would be a good one there. One of the things we're doing with… playstation right now is we're working on a mobile app with them, right? So like it would be like a full on in the app store app, right? So that, so, so that playstation would have that and it would look like Domo, you know, like, it would still access and all the content would be in Domo, but it's something that like their people would download from the app store or be controlled via MDM intune, whatever, right? And that would be something that they not only have for themselves but also that would be also for vendors, right? So the vendors would then have this app to interact with data as well. So we could talk maybe about that use case there that we are moving forward with. We're hoping to have something at the next DP kind of highlighting that.
Dale W: Nice that's pretty cool to go all the way to app store with it.

Scott T: So, what else you got going on other than these accounts?
Trevor F: So, I've got.
Scott T: Oh, hang on. Let me see if I can turn the recording out until they get here. Never mind. Hi, Trevor.
Trevor F: Sorry, I was on mute. How's it going?
Scott T: Oh, it's all right. I'm good. How are you?
Trevor F: Feeling good?
Scott T: I feel like every meeting that I join where I don't automatically get muted, I think that I am muted. And then every meeting where I do get muted, I think I'm off.
Trevor F: Funny how that works?
Scott T: Yeah, it is. Isn't it? Is anyone else going to join us from the cozy earth side today Trevor?
Trevor F: No, it'll just be me.
Scott T: Okay. And I do think we're waiting for Jenna on our side, but I know she's got some back to back meetings ahead of this. So she might be a minute or two late. Okay. The general idea here is we want to try to put together or gain some understanding about what it is you want this data analyst to be able to do in your instance, right? So, is it, you know, more back end things? Being able to connect the data sets? Is it building out dashboards and app studio? Is it workflow? Like kind of what areas of the platform do you want them to be proficient at? And if it's you know, all of the above, that's certainly a route we can take. But we want to make sure that anything that's kind of going to be critical or vital to their role especially in terms of getting them onboarded quickly so that they're being productive for you that we hit those topics more at the front end of the training and get them up to speed so that they're contributing quickly. But yeah, that's kind of the purpose of the call is just make sure that we understand what it is you're looking for, and then we can kind of work through a training program or some documentation about how we want to proceed.
Trevor F: Yeah. I mean, I think an understanding of everything is going to be great. I think for the focus is probably going to be especially like out of the gate, like more on the front end side. So, app studio dashboards, building visuals kind of like how, you know, how that, the front end visuals, you know, interact, I guess with the back end and, you know, beast mode calculations. Yeah, all of that kind of stuff is probably at the beginning, the main focus, but I think having an understanding of everything will, you know, obviously help, you know, especially down the road as he will, you know, kind of work.
Scott T: In that direction, have they already been hired or are we still in searching for the individual he's.
Trevor F: been hired? He just doesn't start until the thirtieth?
Scott T: Okay. Got it. And then… is he, so, is he a part of a specific team or is it going to be like more like company wide? He's helping support the whole, like all areas of how you're using Domo or is he specific to like, a certain team or not?
Trevor F: He will support company wide. So, so all departments? Okay. Perfect.
Scott T: Is there, is there a particular project or a particular team that he's going to start out building something for? Like, so should we focus on, you know, one area of your instance as we start the training or should it be more broad?
Trevor F: Probably more broad. And I guess was the, as far as the training was the plan to like, you know, train him in, like our specific instance or kind of, like a sandbox environment or, you know, what were you guys kind of envisioning there?
Scott T: So, there's a couple approaches we can take. One… would be having him go to kind of our learndomo, Domo, online training center, which has lots of great content especially for someone just getting introduced to the platform. And we can kind of walk them through different courses, to complete on his own and his own timing. But then, the other thing that we typically like to do also is get really specific about training about how cozy earth is implementing Domo and what data sets they have, and how things are built out there. So, while, we could entertain like spinning up a sandbox environment, typically, what we would do is just have him create like duplicate. If we were going to have him work on etls, for example, we would have him create a duplicate, of a data set or something that you've already got in your instance. So, that way he's not having any impact on any live data. So they have to be, a sandbox environment. It can just be, you know, private data sets that he's working on, but that, we can have that discussion too. I see Jenna joined. So she's going to save me from all my awkwardness, and, walk through an actual talking plan. So, Jenna, we were talking, so there, the, I don't know the analyst's name yet. I apologize. I didn't get that, Corey. Yep. Okay. So, Corey, starting on October thirtieth.
Trevor F: Oh, September, thirtieth, September.
Scott T: Sorry, September, thirtieth, the week from today, and he's going to be supporting cozy earth like the whole company in terms of Domo usage. And so, it's not this particular team. And about all we covered so far is that he does want a very broad general knowledge of like the whole platform, but focusing kind of starting on app, studio dashboards, kind of front end kind of build beast modes and things like that as an initial part, so he can start, and contributing and building things quickly… that's about as far as I got, so.
Jenna H: Yeah, no. That is great. Does Corey have any Domo experience that you're aware of?
Trevor F: No, he doesn't have any Domo has a little bit of Power, BI, just some from like some schooling.
Jenna H: Okay. But.
Trevor F: Outside of that, very fresh?
Jenna H: Okay.
Scott T: I'm playing canvas? Okay?
Jenna H: I like those though. Those are good. Yeah. So he has some Power. BI, is he going to be… I'm just trying to think of like where we start him because, I do think overall Domo… immersion is a great jumping off point when you're trying to cover like all the big blocks at once. Have you done Domo immersion before?
Trevor F: No, I don't think so.

The key highlights were finding a suitable email solution that would allow the info@leafhealth.net address to be used without a separate user account, and determining the best approach for managing the dashboard deployment and access for end-users.","Dan H: Sonya. Sorry about that.
Sonja D: No worries. How are you?
Dan H: Good. Still struggling to get, the brand kit stuff set up. It sounds like.
Sonja D: Well, yeah, I just have a question about that because I, we would have right now, the way that our info at leafhealth net email account works is it doesn't have a login or password, and I think it's like a.
Dan H: Group or something.
Sonja D: Yeah, it's just like a, it's like a shared mailbox, and I believe that clearsquare itself, like for their like communication or maybe I'm remembering this incorrectly, but they require multi factor authentication, for it, or maybe it's the brand kit that requires multi factor. And so, if that's the case, then I don't know if we can use our info at leafhealth net, but maybe we can. So, I just thought I'd ask.
Dan H: Yeah. So I believe, and Calvin is probably more proficient with all this terminology and whatnot, than I am. But I believe what clearsquare does is clearsquare sends it from a different smtp… but sends it as if it was coming from info at leafhealth. And I believe ours actually uses the office, you know, the office 365 API to actually have the email get sent from info at leafhealth net or whatever it is. So, I think one is spoofing one and the other is an actual integration. Yeah.
Sonja D: I agree with that assessment. I think the question then is, can you do multi factor using a shared inbox?
Dan H: Me just check the doc, let's see. Very good. Thank you. I can remember my dream… honestly. Let's see. And where are you? Customize emails, smtp integration… supports Gmail, mailgun, office, 365 Sendgrid. It doesn't… say anything specifically about that, but it… does require a username and password. So, if you don't have that, then that's not going to work.
Sonja D: Okay. Yeah. Calvin, we don't have a username or password for info at leafhealth. Net. It's just shared inbox.
Calvin M: Yeah, just shared inbox because we actually don't have a separate o, 365 account… for that user. So there's really no user behind it. It's just kind of a virtual box that some of us have rights to.
Sonja D: So then… okay. So we would need to basically have another outlook inbox created… and I'm going to, I would have to work, with… our whatever it services team to make sure that we're not charged for, I don't know. We're going to have to like, we're not charged for certain things because it becomes a whole new like person right in their mind. And if they're managing, our network and all that stuff, we, I just have to, I'll just have to talk to them about that. If that's what we want to do, Calvin, I'm assuming we do.
Calvin M: Yeah, that probably makes the most sense. And maybe we can just get just an inbox, no apps, no, anything else and see what that costs us, you know.
Dan H: Well, the other thing that you could do is you could use, so we support, let me pull this list back up again. Where did it go? Okay? Mailgun? And Sendgrid? I'm pretty sure that Sendgrid is free for up to like five… 100 emails a month or something like, a pretty high number. But Sendgrid should work with your shared inbox because… I believe Sendgrid works the same way that clearsquare or mailgun right? Either of those you could probably like. I know that I've set up Sendgrid… to send emails from email addresses that are really just email addresses that are groups that don't have a user behind them. And it looks like, so… yeah, I'm just looking at Sendgrid pricing for their email API… you can send 100 emails a day for free. You can send 50,000 to 100,000 emails a month for 20… dollars. Would that?
Sonja D: Just be that it mimics? It, spoofs, like you were saying before, like with clearsquare, but it goes to an actual outlook inbox, it can integrate.
Dan H: Right. So let me here. I actually let me sign in here. I think I still have one that I can show you… let's see. I'm not, I don't know all of the exact vernacular. Let's see six, eight, nine, nine, seven, eight nine. So. Let's see… this process for now. So here's… my Sendgrid account. So let's see here. Here's, the integration guide. This smtp relay, you… basically generate… an API key and… then you can send emails and they let's… see if this let's go to a bigger period of time. No, it looks like I can only go back three… days. Yeah, maybe because I don't have a paid account, but this, let me see if I can pull one up that is sent from there… so you can see what they look like. You can look at the headers. And here we go. So here's one that was sent from Sendgrid… from this reports… email address. Calvin, is there a way to inspect the headers in outlook or Sonya? Does anybody know? I don't know why I'm picking on Calvin?
Calvin M: I don't know, well, it looks like if you're in the desktop client, you can.
Dan H: Yeah. In the desktop client, how do you do it?
Calvin M: So, let's see here you open the email in a pop out. So you're not looking at the preview pane… then you go to file options. I'm doing it right now. It's been a while since I've done this.
Dan H: And then, oh… message, maybe… view… edits file I'm on a mac too, which might… make it weird.
Calvin M: Yeah. I went to file properties, and then it pops up a little window and you can see the internet headers. I've done this to look at phishing emails in the past.
Dan H: All right. Let me see if I can get to it here. Hold on.
Calvin M: So, file properties that's what I just did.
Dan H: Yeah. File on mine doesn't have properties… let's see. I guess the internet will know how to look at email headers in outlook on mac. Right? Qlik in the new outlook. There's no direct way you must switch to the web version. Unbelievable. Let's see. It is kind of a weird thing to do but let's… see if there's a way to do it in Gmail. Okay? Bear with me here. Just one sec. So I'll pull this up. Here we go. Menu, show original. Okay. Here we go. This looks like what we want. That's not, it, let's see. Do this? Okay?

Casey D: Yeah, absolutely. And that's totally possible that's within the product capabilities for sure. Okay? And yeah, momton will take a look at it with you. I'll be on the call too. We can record it and share it with other people if they're interested. Okay? But yeah, it sounds mostly like some kind of setup like with an admin setting or grant that needs to be enabled. So it could be fairly simple. And then the performance latency. Was that a specific data set that Jill was worried about that is aggregating more and more data over time or was there specific instances where it's just delayed beyond normal expectation or what was kind of the oversight there?
Shelly V: So if it's a summary level dashboard, it's very quick if it's a dashboard where it contains a lot of data. The later we get into the year. And the more data that's there, it's taking just longer to refresh when you're moving from card to card or what have you. So definitely something we need to take a look at. Okay? And see if we can do anything different on our side. Maybe I'm not sure, but yeah, we're starting to see that regularly now as we get later in the year.
Casey D: Okay. Thanks for bringing that up. Yeah, that's always an ongoing best practice to look at if there's latency as data accrues because there's a lot of different options we can use to tackle that from looking at the different types of inputs or ingests that you're doing if you're doing full replaces or if you can just update just the data that's changed or if you want to use partitions. So there's a lot of different solutions we can look at there.
Shelly V: Okay, great. Yep. Those are my two hot topics of the week. Good?
Casey D: Deal. No, yeah. Thank you for bringing those up.
Shelly V: Yep.
Casey D: That's good stuff.
Boobasgupta V: Casey, I have one topic to discuss.
Casey D: Sure. Gupta, how are you today? So.
Boobasgupta V: Yeah, actually, when we try to print the screen to PDF, it's… not showing up the details in the codes. Do you want me to show it up? I can show you.
Casey D: Yeah. Is this, do you know if this is appstudio, an appstudio page that you're trying to print? Yes. Okay. So, yeah, that functionality is not yet fully available yet. Last I talked with product, we're trying to have a beta available early in… the year instead of having it done by the end of this year, it kind of got pushed a little bit, but the intention is to have that available where, yeah, you can do full PDF exports from appstudio pages. Okay? Right now, I think they have a limited alpha version where it's very basic. You can just do a PDF export and it does divisions. But so far I've heard from a few customers that are in that alpha that it's they're still waiting for the full version because it's pretty limited.
Boobasgupta V: Got it.
Casey D: Thank you. But with appstudio, there should be scheduled reports that you can use now through email. So it's not necessarily PDF but you can email, which is kind of like the same as exporting from.
Boobasgupta V: No, actually, the request is to present it to preparing for the presentation and showing for the customers. Basically, it's not for emailing.
Casey D: Okay. Understood. Okay. I will note that down and keep you guys updated as we make progress there. But yeah, that's a very common request is to get that PDF exportability going. And Gupta, I might send you the ideas exchange for you to upvote because that always helps to have more feedback from customers about what's important to them and why? So, I know there's already some enhancement requests and ideas exchange that have been submitted on that topic. So.
Boobasgupta V: Okay.
Casey D: Good call. All right. What else? What other issues questions requests, what can we help with today? Anything in the support queue that we need to look at? We have Kyle on the call. It looks like Martin your case was escalated to development engineering to look at, and that's currently in progress. They're currently reviewing that. The other ones, I know we are already investigating with Kathy and Saurav. So, those are the updates I had as of this morning. Is there anything else technical or any other issues you guys are seeing that you want to call out or get a case submitted to Kyle? All right. No worries. Okay. What about any other updates? Chris luck's dead. You always have updates and exciting things going on. What are you working on?
Chris L: You know, I really don't have a lot of updates for you guys this week because last week was wall to wall with a totally unrelated issue that took a lot of time last week. So I owe you guys the information about the updated QBR, I'm going to try and get that done by the end of this week. I meant to have it done by the end of last week but kind of the disaster started the Friday before and continued on until yesterday.

Arley expressed the desire to shut down the instance and explore alternative business intelligence tools, and Fui offered additional courtesy credits and the possibility of an education-specific Domo instance in the future. The conversation focused on the process of shutting down the current instance and Domo's efforts to better serve the educational sector.","Fui K: hey, Arley.
Arley E: Sorry, sorry, I was like talking to somebody that I'm like my gosh, I gotta go to a meeting.
Fui K: No worries. You're good, especially with how ad hoc and how quick turnaround time this was. So, I appreciate you taking time. How's everything going? Oh?
Arley E: We're good. We're hanging in there, just almost finished with some big projects. So we're just on that tail end. So.
Fui K: Oh, good. Good.
Arley E: That's great, Peter.
Fui K: Good. Doing well. Yeah, it's a full on sports mode right now. Oh, you know, so, yes, yeah, my two boys, they're playing football. Surprisingly, there's a little area in Utah. It's called eagle mountain.
Arley E: Oh, yeah. Yeah, I've heard of.
Fui K: That there are so many eight eight, you know, people from Hawaii. Yeah. And ironically, there's also, what was that? The?
Arley E: Whitfords?
Fui K: Oh, yeah, whitfords, yeah. Do you know, Semisi, Levi?
Arley E: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Fui K: You know, those guys, yeah, it's ironically because they're all there, they are now becoming the powerhouse little league football teams and I'm like guys that's not fair. You guys need to move over to my side of the mountain?
Arley E: Yeah.
Fui K: Because all the, it's just the group that comes from Hawaii is next level. So just.
Arley E: A little on board over here. So when they go to, they're like super excited.
Fui K: Yeah. Well, I appreciate again, the quick turnaround time. I know that the team has been having a lot of internal discussions and it sounds like it's a done deal. The deal's already, the decision's been made so, but we appreciate all the time and the effort in trying to figure out and weigh out options. So, the two ideas that I wanted to float past you and Arlene Sione may be able to join as well. He was double booked, so he may join just as a heads up, but one option. To your point, it's like, hey, we don't want to incur additional charges at this time. So, when looking at, let me share my screen… let me know when you can see it.
Arley E: Yeah, I can see it.
Fui K: All right. So I mean you guys are already familiar with sorry, let me pull my zoom back up there. We go. Okay. So the rate is a dollar 50 per credit. What we can see on our side today is, you know, based on the trend and you can see that it has pretty much gone flat, right? Since the July June July or I guess may June timeframe when we saw the spike happen. So right now the overage is at around 30… 1,800 dollars. And so the two options that we wanted to float past you number one, which we don't want to, but we obviously understand the current sentiment right? In the past based on when the team transitioned is if you were to just pay that and we just shut the instance off and then it's done. So that is one option. The other option is we're still working on approvals with our team, but if the team saw any value in keeping the instance open even for the next year, we could, instead of having you pay that overage today, basically just keep it open for that amount that 31,800 roughly so that you could have the additional year and you could just have it open for 20 26 to 20 27. So it would be less than, you know, the current contract is at 60. Where is that? Yeah, 68,127. But those are the two options that we have based on our finance and our legal team's feedback.
Arley E: I think we're pretty set on just turning it off at this point. We're just going to kind of level set again and figure out what it is we really need. And then, you know, figure out where we go from there because yeah… we just, we don't we can't control it because it's the 31 plus whatever we use, right? And so that I think that is we don't we… can't keep it down at this point. So we have to figure out we have to level set again and take everything out, start over because we're just putting a whole bunch of stuff in. We're not sure what everyone's doing. So that's kind of what you know, they decided like, okay, let's cut them off and let's start again and see where we go from there, because.
Fui K: And I think we can just to clarify, we could give you additional call it courtesy credits for the remainder of this year so that you wouldn't we would just need feedback from it would probably be some of the other folks that you had on the calls just to explain like how many credits you think you'd need for the remainder of this year. We are working through a, and I think they roll up differently. But the part of ics that's the church's it department for the core departments, right? You guys roll up under ces, right? So I think they're in tandem, but we are working on a bigger enterprise wide contract with the church as a whole. And so that is another factor that we're trying to make sure we consider and build value holistically, but at the same time, you know, again, I do recognize the feedback of, hey, we just want to shut it off sooner than later and then, you know, and go from there.
Arley E: Yeah, I can ask, but I'm thinking pretty much they are wanting to stop for now. Okay? And probably start again, but I can let you know by the end of today probably and reach out, but, you know, if we choose to turn everything off, what's the timeline for that, how do we?
Fui K: So what would happen in terms of shutting everything off? So I would let our orders, it's called doma orders, and our finance team know, and they would spin up the overage invoice for that 31,800 amount. And then at that point, basically you guys would just shut everything off on internally, right within the platform itself. But then they would also recognize and say, hey, this invoice is going to be sent. I would need to send it via DocuSign, just to be basically an addendum saying, hey, we are canceling the contract… and then paying the overage and then at that point, it would be shut off. We could have our team formally shut it off. So that way nobody has access and nobody's.
Arley E: nobody's still putting on.
Fui K: Right, right. Right. No sasas, right? Oh no.
Arley E: So, sorry, I know I'm so junk, but whatever… it is, what it is, we figure it out, we figure it out.

James H: Yeah, they updated something.
Zachary O: Yeah. Just letting you know I've got something from engineering last night regarding powerpoint. Okay. So for Allison, if she's making a clone copy or like a duplicate copy?
James H: Of the powerpoint,
Zachary O: she's going to have to completely reset everything. So, what I would suggest is if we're going to do a duplicate copy, make the duplicate, the record for the last. So if it's being used as your keep the original as what you're running. Yeah?
James H: And then set you off an old one.
Zachary O: Yeah. So that, oh, this is the hard copy. This is what we presented and it never gets up again because those linkages get broken.
James H: I gotcha. So basically, she could have fixed it if she would have just went back through and brought in those cards all over again.
Zachary O: But it's a pain in the rear, right? Yeah, it's just that she was going about it backwards where she was keeping her original and then cloning everything off, just the opposite.

But yeah, we're just waiting for that beta team to open up access to everybody, but it looks like it's coming soon, so we'll keep you updated on that. Those are the only updates on my end… but Shane, I could turn it over to you now.
Shane W: Yeah. Were there any other betas… other than that one or did?
Ankit S: We get some of them turned on. So that… specific one, we… were not able to get turned on. Jesse and manting. I don't know if you were able to… join that demo beta program group through the link that I sent you… that should give you access to some of the features. If I'm not mistaken. But if not, then please let me know and I'll work with you on that. But from what I was told from our beta team that we're just still waiting on access.
Shane W: To everybody.
Ankit S: Who? I'm sorry, they haven't opened up all those features just yet to even the people in the beta program there. So I think they're just waiting. Hopefully, it's again just like another month or so.
Shane W: So there's some things. So once you join the beta program, you can kind of select into some of those that are available for everybody. And then there's some that the beta program is full. And so, until they do kind of a GA, then it's you can't get into it, okay?
Jesse M: Yeah, and that makes sense. We used to be inside the beta program. So I don't it's been a while since we played with new stuff, but it must have got reset at.
Ankit S: Some point over the years.
Shane W: Cool. And then the main update that I have is that for the azure, I was going in and looking at that in terms of like being able to write back and being able to pull the data down. And one of the things I was wondering Jesse is we can use, so we have our connector but there is a rest API for azure devops. And I was wondering if it would make sense to do like a little jupyter notebook that could or even a workflow that could go and grab data or push updates like a workflow maybe would work better for like pushing updates into azure, but that would be something that would be fairly simple to the program. What I found is actually the hardest part is getting credentials and getting through that piece of it. But if we can get a token, we… should be able to be able to read and write data to those endpoints. If that would be something that you would want to pursue. That way, you know, we can. It looks like that, the connector, you know, it's kind of hit and miss on those endpoints that it's pulling data from. But if we, if we're able to program… it then we would have a lot more control over how… to process the data and how we get it in.
Jesse M: Yeah, no, I'm game for trying that or anything.
Shane W: Else. Anything else is not like too painful, but yeah, yeah, this one shouldn't be too painful. At least from what I saw, I put together a little sample code, in a jupyter workbook, let me share and I'll share with you what we need. Great. I don't my share, my sharing. You… guys see my screen? Yeah. Okay. Yes. So we have, in your instance where you put the credentials in, we created a new one. I'll share this with you called azure devops python. And. you, if you have a access token or token, if you put it in here, then it's kind of in a kind of a secure spot. And in the, in our jupyter, we can access to… make calls using, that those credentials that you put in there. And that's just kind of a way to kind of keep those a little bit more secure than heading them through an email or putting them or coding them into the code. So that's, if that would work, if you could find that token, then, we could put it in here. We could kind of start testing… this. And this is just a simple call. And yeah, I think that's the.
Jesse M: Same token I had to use, to set up.
Shane W: The data sets? Okay, perfect. Yeah, I don't have access to see those that, but, yeah, if you could put it in, yeah, yeah, in that one, then that would be great. And then, and then we could test this. And then, and then we could start to kind of figure out, we can start doing some posts, and updates and things like that, to data. So we can… write back, to azure. So if you, if there's with that form, the intake form comes in through Domo and then we can push it into tagger.
Jesse M: Cool. Yeah. Let's give.
Shane W: it a shot. Awesome. Yeah. So I'll share this with you. Okay. Yeah. So, if you go in and add that to now be great. And then I, we can test it a little bit and we'll go from there.
Jesse M: Yep. Sounds.
Shane W: Good. And then in terms of, I started looking at the, earlier this week, the claims that you have where you've where you kind of union them all together and… you try to match it up. And the coverage didn't seem very good. And I was thinking… that maybe if there's not, if there's not a tool that can match that. Like if you don't have a key somewhere that, in any of those data sets that can match, the claim data. I was wondering if it would make sense to do some sort of like a fuzzy logic or AI lookup where we could have it kind of program and give a best guess. If, if the claim and anyone, you know, if we could tie those claims together and then we can get a like a confidence or in that and, you know, the ones that are, you know, over 90 percent, we might say, OK, this looks right? And those that are under 90 percent, we could go through and we could review them and say, does this, is this or is this a match or no match, right? So that's what I don't know, if that would be valuable?

Vu N: Yeah. Are we waiting for Eric?
Kate K: Yeah, just waiting for Eric.
Vu N: Perfect. Let me use this moment just to like quickly go to the bathroom and,
Kate K: yeah. Do your thing. It's what you gotta do. Thanks. Okay. See you in a sec. I'll be.
Vu N: Back.
Kate K: Yeah. I think Eric's just running behind from another call, but we can get started. Okay? And… honestly, Vu, just, I've been thinking about all of, the rapid growth that you guys have been experiencing and managing. How have you been doing? Just managing it all?
Vu N: It's not the easiest.
Kate K: Yeah.
Vu N: But, I mean, kind… of, I remember from the early days of our initial like onboarding, kind of laid out, the plan. It's not going to be, the prettiest, it's not going to be the, the most organized or the most efficient. So, like, I knew that just based on, like my, like previous experience with Domo, and like, the issues that we had, as we were onboarding new companies as our like systems implementation, was not moving as fast as us as we wanted to, and I remember laying that all out, which was like my initial, push against like consumption model because it didn't make sense signing up for a consumption model at the time. Yeah. So, overall, like, I knew it was going to be a mess. And like, I have a plan for, for getting better, and being more organized. So, this is like not completely out of like left field, so.
Kate K: Yeah.
Vu N: Yeah. So, a lot more chaotic but, it's not, it's actually a lot better because of, all the stuff that we've done and like worrying about adoption and people like using, the tools like, my ultimate goal is like not to have my team try to like control, everything, but more, along the lines of like, the hybrid model of, hey, we're going to try to like help the network, just like upskilling their data skills. And like, I don't want to, I'm, not going to build everything, for, so there's no way, different iterations of the, the strategy, but I think, I think we have a better grasp on it. As of late.
Kate K: Yeah. Well, for me personally, it's been fun and exciting to be a part of the journey so far. And I'm excited to continue seeing it unfold. And a lot of the conversation that we had earlier today was exactly the information that Eric and I were hoping for. So we could kind of start to shape the mindset going into this onsite. And, what framework we want to put together when it comes to the agenda. So, I'm, going to, I'm, going to share my screen real quick. Do you see this? Okay?
Vu N: Yep.
Kate K: Perfect. These are just kind of the basic housekeeping items. This is still the correct location, right? For the headquarters. Okay? Perfect. We have a list of the Domo attendees here. We're also just still confirming a couple of other possible resources… for right now, there's no concern there. And then on the Astra side, I know you had mentioned, near that tail end of the call today, that it'll likely just be the core data group for now. Do you anticipate there being any other audiences or leadership that might jump in here and there to certain conversations or mostly see it being this core group?
Vu N: Probably just, this core group?
Kate K: Yeah.
Vu N: If anything, maybe Scott, would you like the president and coo? But, you… know, that week is going to be busy. So, I anticipate like them… having to worry about their, the summer, team meeting?
Kate K: Yeah.
Vu N: Yeah, yeah. And, not to, not that I care about my title. I don't really care about, my title. It's, VP of, yeah.
Kate K: We'll absolutely change that then. All right. Yeah, I remember last time Scott had just like jumped into one of our meetings randomly. So, like, if that happens again, we completely entertain that and welcome it. So.
Vu N: Yeah, he likes to do that sometimes.
Kate K: Yeah. All right. And then as an agenda, this is really what we want to get your feedback on. I didn't know last time we had started a little bit earlier around eight am in the morning, we can adjust that if needed. But, happy to start bright and early, make the most of the day. Really wanted to plan on starting things off by introducing you guys to the ace program and getting you acquainted with the ace advisor that you guys will likely be working with. Just talk more about the program structure. And then from there, kind of go into continuing the consumption efficiency discussion, the data architecture strategy. Based on our conversation today, Eric and I will come prepared with like recommendations, kind of walk through what we're seeing across our customer base, and then we can kind of keep the hands on, of course, want your guys' input. And, yeah, kind of talk through overall governance structure and then defining, the pipeline, data pipeline strategy going forward. Yep. Does that sound like a good start so far? Yep?
Vu N: No, I like this, I like the agenda. Yeah, I think an hour and a half spending on like AI, it might, I might try to, focus more, on this. Because, I think naturally, it's going to, part of the AI that we can use within Domo will help with the adoption, especially with, finance, instead of like AI just, like again, like probably like, an issue that still goes on is like, we don't need to build a dashboard. We don't need to build an app for like every ad hoc analysis. Typically, the analysis that I've seen, I see are just like, hey, you just go like interact with the, with the data a little bit. It's like just filtering, maybe some drill down somewhere. Yeah. But it's all within the data. So, like, if we can utilize AI, for that, and also like, it will help with the adoption.
Kate K: Yeah, and that's kind of exactly why Eric and I placed it at this part of the onsite, just because we figured it'd flow in nicely to having a more in depth conversation about adoption later in the day and actually building out an adoption",Consumption Pricing Model,462834.6253846154,Corporate,ASTRASERVICEPARTNERS.COM,2,Professional Services,0,< $5M,Upsell,Blank,3: Demonstrate Value,Eric Smith,2026-01-09,2025-03-10,2025-04-30,2025-08-05,,,,,0015w00002qxRuTAAU

Kevin W: Yeah, no worries. We're connected. Good morning. How are you?
12 5: I'm doing all right, yourself?
Kevin W: Just fine. Thanks.
12 5: That's great. You sound a little deflated.
Kevin W: No, no, no, I'm in Utah. It's corporate this week, so, it's getting started, yeah?
12 5: Okay. I'm sorry, we could have done this.
Kevin W: Later. No, no, this is my second call. I do a lot of business in the east coast. So, when I come out here, I have to get up early. Okay? Fair.
12 5: Enough. We deal a lot with Microsoft. So I get it.

12 5: You guys are, what? Two hours behind out there?
Kevin W: Yeah, yeah, it's seven to eight this morning.
12 5: Gotcha. Yeah… I went to vegas last… about a year ago, and that was the first time I'd been like anywhere on the, even close to the west coast. I've never really had to deal with the time change before I've been to like Colorado, but they're only a year. They're only an hour behind and I was amazed at the difference those two hours make. I was like ready for bed by like eight o'clock and I was going at four a M at four a M.
Kevin W: Exactly. Yep. Try going to Hawaii sometime.
12 5: Oh, man.
Kevin W: You get up really early. You get your day started early?
12 5: I bet, right. Takes a long time to get used to that.
Kevin W: Yeah, it's kind of nice. Actually. Yeah.
12 5: There's that side of it too, right?
Kevin W: Yeah, I like doing that in Hawaii in particular. It's so pretty in the morning there, I can get out and go for a walk on, you know, along the ocean. It's always so nice. It's not the worst thing in the world.
12 5: You're just ready for bed by seven o'clock.
Kevin W: oh, yeah. You have dinner and you're like you're done. I mean, you're just and, you know, usually, you're sitting by a pool or something and doing something all day. So you're just completely toast… you're like good night… but it is pretty cool because like, you know, like all the sporting events and stuff, you know, you can hang out at the pool bar and it's like one in the afternoon or two in the afternoon. So everything's super early. You know what I mean? Because it's time for the most part. And like everything's done by like seven or eight o'clock and you're ready for bed.
12 5: Yeah, that's true. There you go.
Kevin W: It is a nice place. Yeah, my wife and I got married there and then we went back for our twentieth. Oh nice. Yeah, it's really nice. I highly recommend it.
12 5: We usually go to Jamaica and that's nice. It's the same time, so you don't have to worry about it, but I hear that Hawaii is a whole different animal and very beautiful.
Kevin W: Yeah, yeah. It is. It's an amazing place for sure. It's an entirely different atmosphere.
12 5: Maybe one day.
Kevin W: Someday someday.
12 5: I.
Kevin W: recommend going save your Penny that's right? All right. I think you got feedback. We've been working… furiously with the other groups to make sure they got the right sizing of things. I assumed after I talked to them a couple days ago that I'd probably be hearing from you. So I wasn't surprised.
12 5: Yeah, yeah. I talked to them both quite a bit yesterday. I was trying to get, I mean, Amit I got with at the end of last week, I think he was out of office earlier this week and then the symphony side took a little longer, but I was able to meet with both of them yesterday. It sounds like from what they're telling me that at least currently they don't need the extra capacity that was in the offer that you guys had sent over. Amit said that they're using well, I don't know about well, but he didn't give me the exact number, but he said they're using under their 200,000, they don't have any plans to grow. And symphony said they were using around 60 of their 75,000 credits and don't really have tons of plan on growing either. So that was the feedback they gave me.
Kevin W: So that doesn't align with their current usage, which is.
12 5: And I kind of thought that might be a question, right? Because I assume that if we have dashboards, you guys can see them too.
Kevin W: Yeah… yeah. We can see the current usage. So right now, and I talked to symphony about it and I was like you guys have got to work with gff because some of the gff stuff in some of the symphony instance, the teams are currently running into overages. So that's what we were trying to do is account for the overages. So if there's not going to be any upsell, then we're going to have to turn around and bill for the overages at the end of the year. So we're trajectoring to about 20,000 in overages at the end of the year.
12 5: Yeah. I don't know why they would tell me that.
Kevin W: Yeah. So if they want to renew at the same number, right? There is what we're building into what was built into the contract is there is a six percent increase, right? There's a cpi, right? So if they're not going to grow, we're pushing for that cpi, you get standard credits year over year, right? And we agreed in the contract as well to reduce the credit rate to help ease, you know, some of the growth numbers and make it more attractive. So that gave them room because we went into overages last year to not go into overages next year. So we're into overages. We're going to be into overages. We're going to be about 20,000 credits into overages.

Vu N: Pretty good. How's it going with you?
Aishwarya D: I didn't hear you sorry.
Vu N: Going pretty well. How's it going with you?
Aishwarya D: Yes, yes, pretty good. Ankit won't be able to join us today. He's done with covid.
Vu N: Oh, oh… it's important to hear.
Brian W: Hello? Hey, boo. Hey.
Eric G: Hey, guys.
Aishwarya D: Hey, Eric.
Eric G: All right. So, I think we got a couple things figured out yesterday, right? I think we figured out, boo, I think you pinged me the budget issue with east, non union or whatever it was. I can't remember what it was now.
Brian W: Yeah, modern Calvert, we're pulling through.
Eric G: Yeah. So that's fixed, was that?
Brian W: The naming convention, boo, that I changed the roll up or call it a modern platform now?
Vu N: Yeah, it was just, it just unchecked when it changed… adds another dimension. So it's just literally like five Qlik of a button.
Brian W: Okay. Nice.
Eric G: All right. So, I actually haven't looked at anything. So, I'm going back to our validation dashboard… now. And then the other thing I think we figured out was the issue with the. What do you call it? The books causing a balance sheet problem? Did I?
Vu N: Don't know. Yeah. So, ash, the… data is like, technically right? I'm sorry, your formulas are technically right? It's the data source where we're doing some cleaning, some data cleaning within our accounting system. So, there are several accounting books that we're using to stack on top of each other. So as they're cleaning, they… just need to clean some of the reporting books as well. Eric and Brian. So I was looking into the ETL… or the balance sheet yesterday. So, what I was able to include was a column called like book id, same concept as intact. These are the books that you want to use. They're literally like just stacked on top of each other. Yeah, what I don't know yet is I don't want to exclude the historical book for everyone yet, because I don't know who's going to get impacted… but I think for the ones that look off, we can exclude any book… that doesn't look right? And primarily, it's been the historical that I've seen like as the data's getting cleaned up. Like… I think entries in the historical book need to be reversed. I think Dan bava knows this like the best he's done it with like modern he's done it with Ge. I think they're aware. I don't know how aware everyone is… gbts are. So for ash's calculation… leave it as is. I am going to just go and exclude historical books for a couple of companies. I'll make that list and I'll send it to you guys. If, so we're like aware so that like the numbers just match, okay? For.
Eric G: the time being until we can get them to fix the books.
Vu N: Yep.
Eric G: Thank you.
Brian W: Yeah. Just as a side note, like to me, this should be part of the whole sage one source of truth. Like, I know the PL is getting the most focus, but when they're stacking all the books, like it should make sense as well. Yes. Yeah, because like having like, well.
Vu N: For afco, like here's an example, like they use a historical book for like an opening balance sheet. So, they had one, I'm just choosing a date, July, 20 24 was hypothetical. So like 20 24, they put the opening balance sheet. Now, what they're doing in the regular accrual book, they're correcting all those entries. So it goes all the way back… to what it should reflect, that like historical accrual book is now sitting on the regular accrual book. And so like,
Brian W: and carrying forward, yeah.
Vu N: Yeah. They, they corrected it in the past, but it's now like kind of double counting, yeah, based on because of that historical book. So they just need to reverse whatever that opening balance sheet and historical.
Brian W: Okay. Hopefully, it's just a balance sheet item because if they reverse like a PL item, I mean, that can throw off the future periods.
Vu N: Yeah, we'll see. Yeah.
Brian W: I guess as a spot check for like what you're saying earlier on like the filters for like what books to include or exclude for specific companies. I mean, part of the validation here is we can at least just look at Ar by company and figure out, I think like what book to include or exclude. I probably by default for the more recent periods, the accrual book is fine. But like, yeah, when we get back into the historical book is going to cause some noise. So like I don't know if you want to, is that filter like by month, like this is where it starts to get complicated, you go opco by opco across five different books across. We're doing ttm 12 months?
Vu N: Yeah, I think, well, I think it's 20 23 that, oh, yeah. Well, I just want to be accurate. We do look at accounts receivable is right, for apco, OK, for some reason, it's the cost in excess of billing.
Brian W: Oh, yeah. They're whip, yeah.
Vu N: It's like they're costing it the axis of the building should be like, for some reason, it's showing like, but you… take out the historical book. It matches exactly to the excel package.
Brian W: Wow. Okay. Interesting.
Eric G: Yeah.
Vu N: So that's that, let me ask that's on me. I'll look into, the book so you can put, your calculations there. Do you want to share your screen and walk through everything else?
Aishwarya D: Yes.
Eric G: Yeah. I think the good news is… operating profit versus budget and versus prior year in that top table, which is kind of like a, you know, result of everything above. It looks right to me and, versus budget and prior year. One weird thing. And maybe Brian or maybe you might know what this is, but I'm thinking it's Brian's question the budget revenue… just looking at month to date is high like our budget revenue should be 93 point one and it's 94 point three. But gross profit and opex are off as well. And so your total operating profit ends up being right? So I'm wondering if we know what that is or how that could be possible? Like how they're all off by the same amount such that the total operating profit budget is still right? Even though the things above it are wrong.

Chris G: Pretty far. Well. I used to know that area, well, like back in the 19 eighties, I actually grew up in the American fork area, but have not lived there since like 87. So, it always shocks me. You know, whenever I'm back in town there, how much things have built up and just how populated the area has become?
Meshell R: Oh, yeah. It's changed so much with all the tech companies. Yep, I.
Chris G: remember, you know, when I was living there, I think American fork had a population of something like, you know, three or 4,000. It was still a tiny middle of nowhere kind of place, but,

Chris G: Well, I still miss the mountains that's for sure. We don't have anything like that down here in Florida.
Meshell R: Oh, yeah. Were you in Florida when the big hurricanes hit? I guess there's hurricanes all the time, right?
Chris G: Oh, yeah. Every year, we, when the gosh, I can't even think of the name of the hurricane last year. The big one that came through Helene. We lost about five or six huge trees on our property and, you know, blocked the access road. All of that good stuff. I think we were without power for five days, but, oh,
Meshell R: goodness.
Chris G: We're used to those kind of interruptions down here. So, you know, I've got not one but two backup generators and a good chainsaw and log hauling equipment at this point. So, oh, wow. Bring it on.
Meshell R: Yep. You're ready? What type of backup generators do you have? I forgot what the name of the other ones are about?
Chris G: I have a dual fuel, so they run on either propane or gasoline, but I have just kind of a smaller portable that's like a 8,000 watt that I just use, you know, if the power is only going to be out for a little while to keep the fridge and deep freeze cold. And then I have a big, like 15,000 kilowatt unit that can run the whole house with air conditioner and everything. If we're going to be without power for a little longer.
Meshell R: Oh, yeah, you are definitely, are you, would you call yourself a prepper then?
Chris G: Ah, yeah. You know, I've got my food storage. I've got the, you know, power backup and at least 100 gallons of fuel. So, I'm feeling well prepared. I was a boy scout and the boy scout motto was be prepared. So I'm still living?
Meshell R: There. Yeah. But you're a lot more prepared than I am. I know when we had an earthquake here a couple years ago, my town was at the center, so we were without power, but I thought I was so cool because I had this generator. Well, I didn't think about the gas part. Yeah. And so I went to the gas station and the line was around the corner and none of the gas pumps, I think only one of the gas pumps was working. So, yeah, that was definitely a lesson learned.
Chris G: Yep.
Meshell R: Let's see. None of my team's here yet. I'm getting ready to get on the road too. Let me ping them. Let me ping the team real fast… We'll give them another minute. I think they're probably just all stuck on calls. Oh, I see Scott on now. Hey, Scott.
Scott T: Hello?
Meshell R: I was just pinging Ivan.
Scott T: Yeah, I don't know if, if Ivan or Jenna reached out to you, I think they're trying to cancel most of Jenna's calls today because she's got a bit of a family emergency with her daughter. So, I don't know what that means for this call. I was trying to find out because I think that we were focused on, some roadmap discussions that Jenna and Sharon had been working on. So, I'm not sure if we want to. I don't have information that I was, I've been focused on trying to get the workbench job going, or I'm sorry, this is pack size. I've been working on getting the, we've had two sessions with our engineering folks trying to get this sandbox promotion issue going. The question I had, Jordan, I did see your response to this. And, I had some questions about how the sandbox instance was set up. It seems like there's a, is there a Domo everywhere instance, that's pushing the data out via some sort of publication? And then, cause, I don't see a repository with the data sets or data flows themselves. I just see like it's a federated connection into your other instance. So, did you set it up as like a Domo everywhere instance to get the data in? And then we're doing sandbox to promote the content or do you know how that was set up?
Jordan H: I know that Domo had to go create most of those instances for us because it wasn't giving us that ability, but.
Scott T: Gotcha. I'll have to keep following. Is that cause that was a question they asked, the engineering team asked me wanting to understand like if it was a sandbox or a, a Domo everywhere instance?
Chris G: So, so I was the one who?
Sanjeev K: I think we use virtual data set to transfer data sets, and.
Jordan H: Go ahead Chris.
Chris G: Yeah, sorry. So, you know, again, this kind of goes back to the meeting we had, I think last September with, Neil and Meshell, where really the topic was around the, you know, data governance and where, you know, we, they shared the slide with kind of this, model of using sandboxes in the mann",Consumption Pricing Model,452039.4,Corporate,PACKSIZE.COM,12,Manufacturing,767,$100M to <$250M,Upsell,Sales,2: Determine Needs,Neil McGoldrick,2026-08-27,2023-10-26,2023-10-26,,,,,,0015000000grkrBAAQ

Good morning.
Karl A: Hey, Mike.
Michael N: How's your week going?
Karl A: Hello?
Michael N: How's the week going? It's Friday? Hey, Teva. Hey, Joe. Hello, Brendan morning.
Tivakanoa S: Morning.
Michael N: I don't think Dale's joining us this morning? Hey, Cole. Can you hear us now?
Karl A: Yes, I can hear you now.
Michael N: Okay. Perfect. Who else are we waiting for from the ipg side? I think we can get started then we waiting for anyone else, Cole?
Karl A: I don't think so.
Michael N: Okay. Well, happy Friday. Everyone. It's been an interesting week. It's been long. Hopefully it's been good for everyone. What do we have that we need to look at? Cole. We'll start with you?
Karl A: I think the only important one really is the webhook ticket… which currently working through, I'm going to send a response to you later on today, Tiva. But I think the gist of it is that no, we don't know if anything's changed in it.
Tivakanoa S: Okay. That sounds good. I do have an engineering right now and I'm not sure what's causing the issue. It just says that there's like a data discrepancy or what I mentioned earlier. Like that. There was a change in something… with the data provider, so that's why I asked there, but I'm… going to try to see if I can push on it before the weekend, just get something approved so we can get more details by next week if anything.
Michael N: I.
Karl A: appreciate it.
Michael N: What's going on? Is it stuck on our side, Tiva?
Tivakanoa S: It's stuck importing. When I checked the backend. It said, well, I just had it open. It says, why can't I find it now that… it's an issue with the data provider. So like it says that Delmo's ready, but there's an issue with what's coming through. I just can't find the ticket for some reason in progress… here. It is… yeah, it says Delmo's ready, but there's an error parsing an unexpected Json response from the API. So we're… just trying to see if there's a change in their data. And I'm working with engineering to see what's the unexpected issue or what parsing error we're facing if that's the case and why it's stuck in importing. But if I don't get a kickback today, I'll loop you in something Mike and Joe, so we can like kind of get somewhere with it because I've had it with engineering since Wednesday, so I'm just waiting to hear back from them. Yeah.
Michael N: Yeah, that'd be great to get that resolved as quickly as possible. Anything else that we have on our side, Tiva for tickets?
Tivakanoa S: Let's see. I have two for Carl. It seems like they're both the same issue where it's the… looks like you just, okay. So you got the Json no code connector working?
Karl A: Yep. That one's good. You could close that one up.
Tivakanoa S: Okay. Cool. I figured it was probably like a pagination issue. So based off what you said, it makes sense that it works now.
Karl A: Okay. I think it's just to do the amount of data. I don't know. Look, this is from speedcore and speedcore are perpetually a pain in the ass.
Tivakanoa S: Okay.
Karl A: Yeah. So they probably did like some switch in the backend to reduce the amount of data that we can get out. Yeah, that's not working.
Tivakanoa S: Okay. So they're just changing limitations. That makes sense. So, there's that one, the one I just talked to you about. There's one for Kevin McLaughlin engineering friend got back. They're saying that the endpoint that they're using for the application is invalid or doesn't exist. And then there's one for Dale about task queue, sending emails. It's now in product enhancement versus bug. They're going to work on the verbiage so that it's not confusing, but it should, it's working as intended from what I'm understanding. So I sent an email to Dale and yeah, that's all the updates I have, you guys only have those four tickets. So.
Michael N: Yep. Okay. Cool. Carl, let's get rid of that speedcore thing. That seems like a nightmare?
Karl A: Yeah, don't get me started.
Tracy P: I figured I'd push a button on a Friday before the weekend.
Michael N: Anything else, Carl for Joe and I?
Karl A: No, I don't think so. I can see there's that session next week on the, what is it? It's? The, what… are you guys calling that feature? Like the new sheets, the excel like thing in doma?
Michael N: Joe, do you know that, what's coming up next week?
Joe P: I believe it is plainly called worksheets. Carl. I don't want creativity. I don't want to be in there.
Karl A: Worksheets. I'm really interested in this. I'm quite excited to see what this can do.
Joe P: Yeah, that one's going to be kind of cool. I think especially for people like me. I don't know if you're the same way. Sometimes I just want to use something like excel for my data and I don't want to transform everything through an ETL and make a new data and make a new data set. So, I think that one's going to be very popular. We started teasing it last year. If you remember at connections really, it was, there wasn't much to it back then. So I'm anxious to see where it landed.
Karl A: Yes, yes, me too.
Michael N: Awesome. And that's Joe, what day is that? Do you know? I'm not.
Tivakanoa S: Sure.
Karl A: I think… yeah, it's the 20 fifth at one PM.
Michael N: Okay. For.
Karl A: Ipg health people, you can, you should probably attend this. I think it'll be quite important for everyone and you can get a link to it if you go to the ipghealth. Domo. Com before you log in. There's, an ad for it.
Michael N: The question I had for you, Carl, was the office hours that you're doing? Are you finding it positive with the Domo crew there? Are they helping?
Karl A: Yeah. I mean, certainly, I think that the first sessions were helpful. I think we need to figure out we may need to go back to the drawing board and just make sure that this is a valuable use of time. I think that people are coming with questions, less people are coming for training that's a bit unfortunate. So, anyway, I'm going to meet with Ankit from solve next week and see what his thoughts are. I do notice that no one from our team is attending these, Tracy and Brendan, you guys are both invited.

Greg D: Hey, how are you?
Scott B: Doing great. Good, good. You have any plans for the weekend?
Greg D: Not really. My wife's going away. So, I got all the kids this weekend. Ah, it's not a bad thing. It's good dad, kid time, but, I,
Scott B: don't know how many kids do you got? Two? Okay. How old are they?
Greg D: Five and seven?
Scott B: Okay. That's a fun time also kind of a stressful time.
Greg D: Yeah. So we got some things we'll do? I just don't know exactly what or when depends on the weather, so.
Scott B: Yeah. My kids are older man. Mine are. So I have twins and they're juniors in high school. Wow. And then I've got a daughter that's like 14 going on 20. She's just girls… are so much harder than boys. Yeah, they are my.
Greg D: Seven year old's a girl and I feel like she's going on 16.
Scott B: So, yep. Yep. So Ashley, I don't know if you were like that, but it's a handful.
Ashley C: It gets better, but it gets worse first. So.
Scott B: Yeah, yeah. Good to know.
Ashley C: Mine are, I got a 19 year old girl and a 25 year old son?
Scott B: Same thing. It was. The boy was easier than the girl or no?
Ashley C: For sure?
Scott B: Yeah.
Ashley C: I mean, they both had their moments but I mean, now they're fun.
Scott B: Yeah. Now, I mean, my boys are 17. They're so much fun starting to work. You know, they're figuring out how to drive. We're working on cars together, working on bikes together. It's so fun now.
Greg D: Yeah.
Scott B: But yeah, had to go through it. Thanks. Should we bring up that agreement and just walk through really quick so you guys can know where we landed on credits. Can I do that? Will you guys entertain that for a minute? Sure. I got you as many as I could. Let me pull it up. So, again, you won't see this in your instance until the first, because that's the start date on this agreement. But Ashley, you should see an uptick in credits on the first by 23,000. So you'll see an increase in allocation on the first for that many. If you've gone over by then whatever it will offset. So it won't be a problem. And then, you know, coming years, you've got 40,000 for there. So anyway, hopefully, that's clear enough if you guys have questions about it. Let me know.
Greg D: The only thing I have is… obviously, are you open to modifying going up in the future? So if we ever decide to hey 40,000 is not enough, can we add another 5,000 on or whatever it might be for this year for whatever reason? Like can it be at the same price point at the current 40 KR, right? Because even though we're only buying 5,000, I just want to make sure that's the case. And then obviously, if we look to increase credits overall… in future years to just kind of modify this and redo that going forward.
Scott B: Yeah. So that's the way that I would recommend doing is modifying it, moving forward if you just add credits for any single year. So let's say in 20 26, you just want to add five more credits, but you don't want to add them to 20 27. We call those one time credits and they come at a 25 percent per credit upcharge. However if you want to just like add them to future years, then we can do it at not one time credit rate, which is the same rate that you're at today, which is a dollar 25. Got it. So if we want to add them to years two and three, we can add them to, you know, two, three four, whatever, then we can add them to all going forward years, not at the one time rate. Got it. Now, if you continue to find cool new use cases and usage goes up, the next tick down in price per credit is at 75 K. So if you get to the point where you're spending, you know, 75 K might.
Greg D: As well just redo the contracting might?
Scott B: As well just redo it and get a dollar 10 for all those credits. Yep. That's what I would do. Okay? That way, you get way more, you know, bang for your buck.
Ashley C: Okay.
Scott B: Absolutely. That's why I would recommend it. Ashley, do you want to share your screen and we'll walk through reporting. Yeah, I'm curious to see what you're bumping up against. Oh, I've got some AI videos I want to send you too.
Ashley C: Okay.
Scott B: I just found this AI agent building series that our ace team puts on every month and they've got five of them and they walk you through in detail how to build out agents. So I'll send that over to you so you can get kind of that wrangled. And then I think we also talked about doing like more in depth ETL transformation stuff. I've got some stuff there. I can send you or we can just do a working session if you want to. We brought that up maybe on two calls ago.
Ashley C: If you want to go ahead and send them, just, okay, things are a little busy right now.
Scott B: Okay. Yeah, I'll just send them that's fine.
Ashley C: What screen am I sharing? Can you see this credit utilization chart or are you seeing yourself?
Greg D: Yes.
Scott B: Yeah, I can see your credit utilization chart. So I don't know if you can see my drawing on that one, but that's what I'm seeing.
Ashley C: So this, obviously, I'm finding under the admin tab.
Scott B: And.
Ashley C: I find this a lot easier to follow clearly because like I can see that for September, I've used 1,608 for example.
Scott B: Correct.
Ashley C: I can't seem to find this chart on the dashboard because it'd be great to like get this once a week or something automatically.
Scott B: So there's a couple of different tools I want to walk you through. And then I actually have a question to see if you guys would be interested in being a beta tester on something. Okay? So Qlik on credit balance right here. This will walk you through and then Qlik on maybe this one for August. So this will show you your starting number of credits for each month, how many credits you used each month, and then your ending balance. And come October first, this starting standard balance will add what 30,000 credits or whatever to it, just so you know, so if you're curious like where do I stand? These are like bank statements for every single month. So you can see kind of where things are at every single month. So keep that in mind that, that's there and available to you. Hit this expansion.

Sonja D: Not really.
Dan H: Yeah, I didn't catch that one.

Dan H: Where are you based out of Bradley? Are you in Florida or something?
Bradley S: Houston?
Dan H: Houston. Yeah, well, might as well be Florida.
Bradley S: That would be correct. Yeah, the joke is we get seasons a year. It used to just be summer and not a year. So, we actually had a little bit of a fall in the last two years, but before that, you know, maybe January, February, a little September.
Sonja D: Just a.
Bradley S: Funny story for me. At least I was working at home like I am. Now, the air conditioner went out on December second on December third. The temperature outside was to 94 degrees. I had an office with about eight computers and four printers running. So, my house was over 100, no air. Conditioning. They said the cold front's coming. I called the AC Guy. They said we'll be here in two days. I almost went to a test off app, but I had to work. I was on the clock so they came, they installed the new air conditioner because it had to be. So, when they got it done, they showed up. When they showed up, it was nine degrees. At 10 am. When they left at 10 am, the cold front had come through and it was 40 degrees outside… but we had over 90 degrees for four days the first week of December. So, now that's not the norm but, you know, good timing.
Dan H: Hello, Calvin.
Bradley S: Let me ping Robert just to see if he stepped away or something.
Sonja D: No worries. Let's get started real quick. So, there's a couple of things that are going to come down, Dan, that I'm going to need some help with it's more along the lines of capabilities that we want to build out. Okay? So, we've got, you know, we've got our group, our group level data governance in place. We're starting to build in Salesforce, the, you know, specific required fields that we need, you.
Dan H: know.
Sonja D: I've got the connection to Salesforce, for the, opportunities that are open and when they close and that's the, you know, that's the, workflow that we wanted to. I wanted to talk through, you know, rather than at this half hour meeting, I think I either need to know what I need to be prepared to show you and talk through or we need to set up maybe a separate like call that just specifically focuses on that workflow and that, you know, that, trigger if you will because I think that there's a lot of moving parts that go, go into, that are going to have to be built and, you know, and it's like they might not all like happen at the, in the right order if that makes sense, like I might be more ready to do the Salesforce activities or that I'll probably run into some requirements that, you know, are needed, after the fact. So, let me,
Dan H: get rid of this. Yeah, I think the, so this was where we talked about if an opportunity is closed, one in 30 days, we're going to check to see about a consulting opportunity. We're.
Sonja D: going to have the account executive basically go in and like actively work to say, you know, what, was the pricing that was implemented? And then we need them to have the ability to come in and memorialize that pricing. So, we have kind of a, the structure for it. We need to finish the actual pricing master. And then how do we, how do we append the client specific pricing into a separate table? So, I probably need to just put a project plan together and identify all of the dependencies you know, and things like that. But, you know, we have the basic foundation here, right? With, you know, with, so they've gone through in this, what I'm showing you right here is the end result of us basically putting in, hey, this, you know, these are the different, you know, four different PBM scenarios that we're modeling here's. The savings for each of them. And then, you know, here's the client presentation that I'll have to build some, training around because, you know, we can essentially have, and that's another question I guess for you is right now, if I want to run the report that's tied to, this dashboard, I have to go, I have to edit the dashboard to get to this savings analysis report. And then, you know, the filters come through and whatnot, but then I have to, you know, then I have to update my, had to have these updated beforehand. And then I can, save and send, right? But do I want to have that like as a, do I have to like make, allow people to be able to edit this dashboard in order for them to send this report? Or how can I make a report? No. Okay. So, what am I missing about this and making it available? Yeah, yeah.
Dan H: So, there's an admin section for scheduled reports?
Sonja D: Well, it can't be scheduled. So, what? So it's a, an on demand kind of thing. So, how do I?
Dan H: Okay. Let me take that back. There is a admin section for email reports.
Sonja D: Okay.
Dan H: So, you can go in there. You can see them, you can, send them now from there. So, you go to admin, then you go to reports. It's in content about halfway down that left hand side and… go to email reports. So you can see them.
Sonja D: Okay.
Dan H: And then you can Qlik on the little ellipses.
Sonja D: What if they're not admins though?
Dan H: They don't need to be an admin. They just need to have the appropriate grants.
Sonja D: Okay. So edit report view is what you want me to look at?
Dan H: Yeah, I was just showing you there's a send now button right there,
Sonja D: right? But the filters need to be in place, right?

Shiela A: Yeah. I was also thinking when it comes to format, maybe… there's like three or four for fedex. So they just vary on what services are included. Like there are some that doesn't have the international services or sometimes they just have the export and import and they don't have the third party. Okay? So I guess that's the other most common… formats that we receive other than that, they're very rare, so.
Scott B: Okay. And then for ups.
Shiela A: I would say two major different formats… and they're totally different formats.
Scott B: Okay. Cool. Well, allow me to introduce a couple of new people on the call. So I've got Dan roden. He's part of our he's director of our, I don't know, help me out, Dan, what's your official title solution design?
Dan R: Yep, strategic solution.
Scott B: Okay, perfect. And then we also have Jesse wolfson joining us from Canada today, Jesse. What is your, do you want to help me out with your title there?
Jesse W: We're in the same team. Nice to meet everybody. Dan and I are on the same team. Don't worry about titles.
Scott B: Okay, perfect. All right. Cool. Sounds good to me. We brought them on. They've been pretty heavily involved in kind of behind the scenes. Nick. As we continue to scope this out, the good news is we were successful in our testing and I'm going to have colt walk us through all of that today. So what we're hoping to do is show the output, some of the design that went into this as far as the testing, and then decide mutually kind of what is required in order for you guys to feel good about this POC coming to a close? And then next steps which gets into scoping and pricing. And that kind of stuff. Is that an agreeable path forward? Nick? Yeah. Okay. Colt, would you mind bringing up what you've been able to accomplish and what the results have been?
Colt S: Let me share my screen.
Nick N: Would you mind if I record this just so that I can share this internally?
Scott B: I'm recording it too. I can send over the recording. I don't mind though, Nick, if you want to cool.
Nick N: So, I know Dan probably would like to see this… request host to record to the cloud. You can't send cloud recording requests because of the host settings. Yeah. So maybe you can just send it to me after?
Scott B: Yeah, I'll just send it over.
Nick N: Okay.
Colt S: All right. So I'll start with what I began with. So the first thing I did was go into your site and basically just pull out a few of the different sections there for things like ground residential, all the different zones, international economy, and pull out a few of these different ones just to format the data ahead of time. Depending on the format of the agreements that we get going forward. This process may look a little bit different but for now, I wanted to kind of just lay this out and say, okay, let's go through each one of these and find what the individual rates were. I think we talked before Nick, when we were going through this, I was having some issues trying to do everything at once. So I said let's go away from that and we're going to go as granular as possible. And so what this is actually going to do is a process where I'm going to feed in ground residential one and up is the way zone two go find this rate and it cycles through one by one. And so the way that works just so you can kind of see. So I have a process that truncates the data set. So it starts fresh every time. And I'll go back and query this data set. You just saw which is this one? And I say, hey, this is my template. On top of this template. I give back how many rows are in here. And then I set up a looping process to say, okay, are there more rates to process? If so, let's pull back the first one. Let's convert it to the right format. Let's give it to AI. They're going to go through the agreement document, determine what that rate should be, and it will actually write it back to this secondary data set which I'll show you in a second, and then go to the next loop. And so it just loops through everything you have here.

They also explored the potential for a Domo-based workflow to initiate a process when a Salesforce opportunity is marked as ""closed one,"" and addressed challenges with integrating data from Domo to QuickBooks, with Dan offering assistance to resolve the issues.","Dan H: how's it going team?
Calvin M: Hello?
Dan H: I feel like it's been a minute since we talked.
Calvin M: I trust all.
Dan H: is going well?
Sonja D: Yeah, so far? So good. We had our beta testing for our reporting tool kind of… out in the universe, so to speak, but not a lot of usage yet. So, I think the folks that are testing are a little busy. So we're talking through kind of our rollout strategy and our launch and things like that. So we'll get it ramped up, but otherwise, yeah, I think things are going well. We're starting to expand some use cases. And one of the things that I've actually asked the… clearscore team is related to the reporting capabilities, right? That were added, which by the way, got rave reviews from our account teams.
Dan H: Oh, good. Yeah.
Sonja D: So, I think that's going to work out great for us. We're pretty excited especially if when we can get it to where it's an attachment. Yes. Yeah. And then I think, the only other thing that I think clearsquare is working on is they might have a comparable capability that they're building out because the one thing that we didn't necessarily want to do is… have it sent from Domo because right now it comes from Domo and they're looking at an option where it can be sent out from, you know, info at leafhealth net, which is, you know, where we like the current clearsquare email that it comes from. So more to come on that, but that's really the plan.
Dan H: You can do that in Domo too by the way, just so you're aware, no.
Sonja D: I'm not aware.
Dan H: Yeah. So it's a global setting, but in an arduous email like info at leafhealth net would not be a bad way to go in the, I can either show you in an instance that I've got or I can show you in yours but.
Sonja D: I can share my screen.
Dan H: Yeah. If you want to share your screen… you can go into the admin section after you get it pulled up.
Sonja D: Let me know when you can see, it looks like it's in the middle.
Dan H: It's not seen anything yet. Usually it'll pop up and say Sonya has started screen sharing and then a couple seconds later, I'll be able to, there we go.
Sonja D: All right. Okay.
Dan H: All right. It's coming up now. Perfect. Okay. I see your ETL. So, yeah, if you go to the admin section and it's under brand kit in the lower left, there, you see where it says emails go to emails. So here, you can hit that plus button on the far right side and you can configure your own smtp configuration and it will send all of your emails. All of your Domo system generated emails will come from whatever you configure in here. You can configure custom headers. You can do all that stuff on the next tab. You can set like your own headers and footers, and you can even put post URL. So any links they Qlik, you know, go to a different domain if you want them to. So.
Sonja D: Okay. So, are you seeing my screen right now? Yeah. So this is this how… I, yep, I've finished. Yeah. And how to, then the host?
Dan H: So, who is your host? Do you use Gmail? Do you use office? Yeah, choose that, and then you… will need to toggle that, use oauth switch. I think you also need to check… use SSL. But yeah, if you hit configure, oauth account, you should see a pop up… go ahead and hit, you don't need to do that part. You go ahead and hit create account. This will ask you to log in as now.
Calvin M: Does she need to log in as the?
Dan H: Info at least? Yeah. So hit, cancel. You've, got to log in as, yeah, info or whatever email address you want it to come from. I.
Calvin M: Don't have that password, Sonya… Nadine may have that.
Sonja D: Okay. I'll get out of here.
Dan H: And you may be able to do it without oauth, right? If you untoggle that oauth, then you'll get that password field like you were like you were seeing initially… it depends on how you have your exchange set up, right? But, or your office 355, but yeah, yeah, I.
Sonja D: don't… know, it wouldn't be able to come from info at leafhealth. Net unless I had it connected to it, right? If.
Dan H: Your exchange account was set up to allow, it could, but it would be cleaner to just put in the username and password for info at leafhealth. Net.
Sonja D: Okay. All right. I'll work with Nadine on that then. Okay. You,
Dan H: hit cancel the header footer tab right next to it right here. So if you look at a Domo system generated email, it's got like a Domo header and footer, you can write your own HTML in there that will replace Domo's header and footer, right? And then there's one other section for the host URL, redirect, hit this X right here. So… this host URL, yeah. And that'll do a good job describing it. But basically, you could set it so that any links they clicked in there would go to, you know, analytics, leafhealth net or whatever. So just know that's an option. It is a global thing, right? So it will, it'll affect every system generated email. Okay? But yeah, okay.
Sonja D: Good to know. Okay, that's helpful. The other question that well, a couple things, let… me think where to start… and we don't have to do them all today. But if you could just take a jot down a quick note about the different things that we need that we want to talk about. One.
Dan H: One.
Sonja D: Is being able to initiate that workflow that we talked about with the Salesforce closed one? Like when an opportunity that's equivalent to a savings analysis gets… changed to closed one, I want it to kick off a process and I want to learn how to write that or set that up. And then the second, is there a way to push a data file, into quickbooks? Or at least generate a file that can then be manually look uploaded, but ideally… directly pushed.
Dan H: Got it. Okay. So let's see something here really quick. I don't know, but I'll find out here in just a second that we have a quickbooks write back connector, meaning a connector that will write straight to quickbooks. I don't think we do. Okay. Just if, you can go ahead and close that. If you hit connect data, hit connectors and just search for the word, write back all one word. Yeah, these are all the write back connectors.

Ashli M: Hello? Good morning. Can you hear me?
Kate K: I can hear you. Can you hear me?
Ashli M: Yes.
Kate K: Awesome.
Ashli M: Sometimes this headset has some fun lines of the tone.
Kate K: No worries. And I have been having some internet instability issues. So, if my video breaks out, let me know and I can go camera off just to make sure that you guys aren't staring at a lagging screen, yeah.
Ashli M: So, yeah, and I was trying to figure out, I have like we have the WebEx and I can do like a background, but I don't really have a background I can add in here. So I blurred it, but then it's like all the people walking by, so I may no.
Kate K: You're good.
Ashli M: Brian Mackenzie.
Kate K: Nice to meet you both.
Mackenzie C: Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you. I have food in my mouth.
Kate K: You're totally okay. Is there anyone else going to be joining on your guys' event today?
Ashli M: No, Todd indicated, he's unable to join today, so.
Kate K: Okay. No worries. And I know truman might be jumping on here shortly but you guys have already had the chance to meet him and work with him closely over the last few months. So I just wanted to take a minute to formally introduce myself since this is our first time officially meeting. My name is Kate kranz. I will be your customer success manager going forward. So truman and I partner very closely together to support all of our accounts. And so anytime you have questions, you run into challenges with Domo, you want to brainstorm and ideate potential new use cases. Truman and I are going to be your go to contacts. Going forward. Something else that I can also assist with typically is just general education and enablement helping you guys define, you know, training programs for your user base that's something that I'm here to support with as well. And then anytime you guys do tend, you know, if there's any break fix type solutions that arise in the problem, you encounter an error message and you have to open a support ticket. I also have access to that team that I can help escalate tickets as needed to ensure that things are resolved expeditiously so that's… a little bit about my role as far as just me personally, I'm based in San Francisco, been at Domo for four years now. So I've seen a wide variety of use cases and hopefully can bring that expertise and experience to support you guys in your Domo journey. But yeah, that's a little bit about me. Ashli. Ryan Mackenzie would love to just hear a little bit more about you all and your roles and involvement with Domo. And then we can jump into just a couple of housekeeping items.
Ashli M: Great. So we'll let Brian go first.
Brian M: Yeah, I can start, I started with a beacon last November and that was my first introduction to Domo. This most recent Domo palooza. And so I've just been kind of getting familiar with Domo doing mostly magic etls and data cards. And so those have been kind of the primary areas of Domo that I've spent my time in so far.
Kate K: Thanks.
Mackenzie C: Awesome. And then I am actually newly joining our team. So I started actually next week, but I have been with our company gosh since the end of July last year and I'm currently in the role of an it project manager. So in my role there, I've managed to make a lot of reports and Smartsheet dashboards. So a lot of visualization. So me joining our group, I'll primarily be focusing on how can I make it easier for our areas to visualize the data as well? So I'm super excited to have fun and play around with that. I have some background with like Power BI and just a lot of excel. I have a math degree. So numbers and data does not scare me. So I'm excited to join and help out wherever I can. So.
Kate K: Awesome. Thanks Mackenzie.
Ashli M: Do you need to know about me or give you the slowdown or?
Kate K: If you're open to it, I'd love that.
Ashli M: Okay. Well, when you said, it was just, you know, when you said, it was like, oh, Brandon Mckenzie, I was like, well, did she get information? I don't know what she got. So anyway, but I've been here just since the end of may. So very new to Domo. Not new to the bi space. I led a bi team at my prior credit union for 15 years and was really more in the Power BI, Microsoft… land of doing visualizations and reporting, but have been completely impressed with the Domo architecture and the model that's there. It's like a fun new toy that I have. And so I have like a vision that goes out a bajillion years. The team will tell you that I gotta like reel it in sometimes because I gotta make sure we're doing things instead of talking about all the fun things I want to do, but it's been a great experience so far. So, hoping to be able to go to Domo palooza this coming March and maybe bring the team. I don't know if there's credits that are part of our agreement or what that looks like in terms of registering, but we don't have to get into that today, but I'm just looking forward to more, so.
Kate K: Amazing. Well, and that's partly why we wanted to set up these recurring syncs. So that way, Ashley, Brian, Kenzie, we can all work together to make sure that we hold each other accountable to bringing that vision to life for you, Ashley. And so that's really the purpose of these syncs not only just to check in and make sure that everything is going smoothly, but we also want to make sure that, you know, we're providing additional value on top of the work that you're doing with the adoption engine team. Yeah.
Ashli M: We've really appreciated their work. It's been a really huge infusion of ideas and we've been able to execute quickly on some of the things. So it's been nice.
Kate K: That's great. That's one thing I was curious to hear a little bit more about. But what have you guys been actively working on with that team currently?
Ashli M: I'll give a high level and then I'll let Brian echo anything that is additional. But we really wanted to focus on, we've had the Domo environment here before a while, but what was created was really like we bought a house and we didn't really move in, right?

Ankit S: Yeah, I know it's been a… little bit of a kick to the gut like for me personally, like I've been, you know, when I started almost three years ago, I basically like almost exclusively kind of just worked with diacto. Yeah, because I was doing a lot of kickstarters at that time and kind of became like the kickstarter like go to project manager. And so it was just easier to like work with diacto. But yeah… I mean, I hear you're I hear you're still kind of gonna just be involved or like to some capacity, just like working like in tech and stuff like that. So that's exciting. And Christine mentioned you're moving to Florida that's pretty exciting.

Ankit S: Yeah, absolutely. And I'm sure. Go ahead. Sorry, go ahead. Oh, no. I was just saying like, you know, I'm sure everyone has been telling you like, you know, if there's anything we could do to help you, like don't hesitate to reach out to us, like just so we're referring you in, but like just know your, like your name and your reputation, like speaks for itself like everybody loves you and has loved working with you and that's… why it's hard to lose you as well as others from diacto. But, you know, if things are aligned, we'll, we'll all be, working together again soon.
Aishwarya D: Yes, I really hope that as well. And it has, I mean, when I started with diacto, I was immediately put on us projects with Domo. So, I, this, I think I interact more with Domo guys than with diacto. So that's why I think it's going to affect me the most.
Ankit S: Yeah, yeah. Yeah. The same goes for, you know, a couple of the other guys too. It's like over the years, like it's just being trimmed and trimmed like, so that's just, it's just, you know, that's just business too. I get it. Like things just have to adapt and change but when are you, when are you moving to Florida?

Ankit S: Okay. It was just vacation.
Aishwarya D: Yes, it was a vacation. So, it was supposed to be for just a week, but I got covid. So I stayed there longer than expected, which is, which actually fell in my favor because that's where I met my husband.

Aishwarya D: Plans of coming to India anytime soon?
Ankit S: Honestly, I don't I just travel. I mean, I would love to don't get me wrong. I think if I can make it work where I'm able to work a little bit and then also stay there because like, you know, only coming to India for two weeks, is it is nice, but it would be nice to come. I don't know. I just as I'm getting older, like if I go overseas like I kind of want to go for like a bit longer like maybe a month so I can really see like more. And then, yeah, absolutely two weeks.
Aishwarya D: Is they just go by? You don't get to settle down and enjoy it? Just feels like stress stressful situation altogether.
Ankit S: Exactly. Yeah. And like, I have no problem. Also maybe just working while I'm there. So like if I'm there for a month, I don't feel like I'm like falling behind on work. And then I'm also just in a different country so I can enjoy, you know, just being there. So I would love to, I'm just really trying to go to more places I haven't been.

He didn't hear you?
Jayden C: Oh, yeah.
Jason J: There you go. What's up? Not much, you know… I'm playing with some of that dataprep stuff that's in gbq to try and overcome a limitation in Domo… kind of similar to what dataprep was, except it's more a, there is more of a pipeline and stuff in there to work with, but Domo's still way easier. I believe it, not surprising, I mean, but I mean, this is letting me do it. I mean, I'm.
Jayden C: do, you know, does Domo have connections at coke?
Jason J: I don't know, ask him. Maybe, Maybe doesn't matter why you got something lined up with coke?
Jayden C: In about an hour and a half? Yeah, the,
Jason J: one you're talking about? Cool. Yeah, ask Michael, he'll know. I mean, because you mentioned that internal, the conversation's open because, he mentioned the internal thing that they said, it keeps looking like a, either… like a cartoon hot dog keeps popping up right here on, the side of you, the coke, like right here… I don't know what it is. It just looks like a cartoon hot dog. Okay. Yeah. Beats me, man. I don't know.
Jayden C: I'm so upset.
Jason J: Howdy, hey.
Zachary O: Apologies, Jason, that I'm not able to give you some real clear defined,
Jason J: Yeah, yeah, I know what you were asking but I'm well, I haven't read your responses to be honest. I've been like dug into the gbq stuff where I'm at playing with the, data pipeline that's there, trying to do kind of a bypass, and, and, and I get that, but it's like, okay, again, it's this can't be an only me issue type thing. There's gotta be more suggestions out there of how to pare things down or to like as of right now, I mean, we can't get any data out of that table, technically, right?
Zachary O: And, that's the problem is, I'm it.
Jason J: It.
Zachary O: if it is set up identically then, yeah, it should be working identically, but because we got different projects that have some have rows, some don't I gotta assume that there's something about those particular projects and, I would need to probably talk with your dba or whoever manages your.
Jason J: Site, and I God who, yeah, and we have no clue who any, and, that gets back to that point like, hey, if we can poke through and see what like user settings I have and things like that. Hey, no problem. But going any farther than that and finding out information is like you.
Zachary O: Know if.
Jason J: if it's even that easy, I, it's just kind of like throw your hands up in the air and go, meh, why bother? So? But, I think I'm going to have success with this gbq way with using these pipelines and data flows that are built in now. We have like data canvases and data preparations that are like built into our projects. So, I think this is something like, honestly, I think, Google kind of ripped off dataprep, and kind of threw their own together in there. So, somewhat like that… like I said, I think I'll be able to get around it that way because I'm, going to do the, like, I haven't gotten to it yet. That's I'm almost at that step where it's like, okay, I got to bring in the, the prices and we'll see how quick that runs. But my guess is with how stuff's running in here already with doing some stuff, it's going to be almost instantaneous. So, and then I can pull it over hopefully.
Zachary O: Yep, I get it. I don't know if Phil… this is Phil's meeting, isn't it?
Jason J: It's Michael's actually, oh, I don't remember… if, either… of them said anything, to be honest, I.
Zachary O: Didn't see anything. I mean, do you have any, do either of you have anything bring up on support?
Jason J: Just the one that, like I said, that I've been working with there, that, that's all I'm working on, so.
Jayden C: I ain't working on anything.
Jason J: I know that feeling too… well, I'm.
Jayden C: working on my own stuff, but it's not demo, yeah, get.

Jason J: yeah, trying to find ways to solve problems that's the, hey, here's, Phil.
Phil S: Hey, guys. Sorry, I was late.
Jason J: Not not accepted. I,
Phil S: know, hey, the browns won.
Jason J: Yeah, I mean, it's like I said, we, our defense is real. I mean, offense can't do much, but, that defense is, yeah. And, and then good old, the guardians come back from 15 and a half games back, to get the lead in the division with like four games left.
Phil S: Dude, I haven't even been able to pay attention to baseball because of how bad the astros have been. I'm like this is just, I'm like this is so bad.
Jason J: With, again, no offense. Like, the guardians have no offense. They're doing it by like playing small ball, inside the field. It, it, it's ridiculous.
Phil S: Crazy. Oh, man. Well, awesome. Any, any, and Jaden, good to see you again. It's been a while.
Jayden C: Huh. Yeah. A week or two.
Phil S: A week or two. Yeah. How's it been on your side?
Jayden C: It's going, it's flowing going slow but steady, nice, steady burn.
Phil S: Any, I know between you and Jason, you guys were kind of working with, getting a service account over to you? Any progress there, or?
Jason J: Nope, no, I haven't been able to re, broach the subject. I haven't even had any contact with them since the, getting mine up there.
Phil S: Yeah. And Jaden, I've I'll take your lead on it of when, you know, you want us to help or be involved or anything like that. But my, it seems like you're still kind of buried, with current work and,

John H: okay. That's okay. So, just a quick, we've got two people waiting in the room. I'll let them in here in just a second. Just wanted to get you. My plan… today was just a lot of discovery. They've talked to the previous rep before about this, but I have not had any conversations with them around attribution. So, just doing a lot of discovery, please jump in. I plan on kind of kicking the ball or, you know, getting us kicked off. And then hopefully the conversation just kind of goes from there.

Grace M: Yes, Tricia and Katie, said they're not able to make it. So, I think it's just me and Nancy.
John H: Awesome. Well, there's a couple faces on here that you are familiar with and there are some that you're not. So I'm going to just ask a few people to do some brief introductions and then we'll jump in because we want to make sure that we're using everyone's time effectively and efficiently. Does that sound okay?
Grace M: Sounds great?
John H: First off, I've got Jeff, I don't believe you've met Jeff Clovis, at this point. Jeff, would you mind briefly introducing yourself?
Jeff C: Hey there, Jeff, Clovis solutions consultant. I'll be taking along when you meet with John, I'm kind of the more technical wing that works with you to maximize value out of Domo.
John H: Thanks, Jeff. Then we've got vishakha and Florencia. Would you ladies please introduce yourselves?
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm vishakha, shenoy, director of data science, and also senior data scientist here to help out with the scoping and just discovering what you want and how we can help you increase your use of Domo and just success in Domo. And I'll let Flo introduce herself.
Speaker 2: Yeah. Hi, everyone. I'm Flo, I'm a senior data scientist on Domo's AI labs team. And I also help out with scoping and use cases around data science and AI. So I'm just excited to hear what you're working on or what you want to work on.
Speaker 1: Also just fyi, we are both in the room called Neyo. So if you're confused on like we are on mute, but who's talking? I think it's us in the room together but we still wanted to join the zoom and Neyo.
Speaker 2: is not an additional person to clarify.
John H: Thanks for that clarification. We're always in really good hands when Flo and vishakha join our calls. So we are excited to have them join us. And then obviously, you know, Jennee, we can't forget to say hello to Jennee. Thanks for joining us today, Jennee?
Speaker 2: Yeah. Hey guys.
Grace M: Bye.
John H: So, grace and Nancy, apologies if there's any sort of redundancy here, but unfortunately, any conversations that you've had in the past around attribution, I was not a part of. And so we'd like to kind of get a better understanding as to what exactly you're looking for? And I'm sure we'll have some questions along the way, but maybe that's a really good place for us to start is just help us understand, what brought us to this point and what you're looking to accomplish?
Grace M: Yeah, sure. Just to start, I think right now we're kind of redefining analytics for our marketing team and a lot of the stuff that's going on right now because with Ayush who was our data scientist has left. And so now we're looking to complete media mix models. And then we're also wanting to do multi touch attribution because a lot of the platform data that's being recorded in dober right now is duplicated. So don't know how familiar you guys are with media. But essentially, if we run an ad on meta, we run an ad on reddit, and then we run an ad on Google ads. The pixel data basically gives if someone buys a product, it basically gives credit to all three platforms. So instead of one conversion is being tracked as three. And so it's really hard for us to determine what's a real sale, what is actually like the numbers? Are they real? Is the trends real? And now, so we're trying to go through like multi touch attribution to kind of, you know, get a better sense of the directional data that we have. And Nancy is way more informed than I am. So I'm going to let her chime in as well.
Nancy M: Yeah. I think the conversation started happening more. Gosh, I think I want to say it was last fall when a client was questioning some of like the total line, you know, on some of our dashboards where we're looking at all the channels together. And then with the total when that total really isn't a total conversion. When you think about if we're using individual pixels for every partner, they all have their own attribution or look back windows. So we were going down the path of trying to understand what that unduplicated conversion data looks like. We know we have GA iv to look at for most of our clients, but I think the big piece that is missing with that is the view through conversion that we want to make sure we display that in an effective way. So we've looked at using for tracking across all platforms, some of ",Consumption Pricing Model,105001.00000000001,Corporate,LEWISMEDIAPARTNERS.COM,7,Media,20,< $5M,Renewal,Blank,2: Determine Needs,Kate Kranz,2026-04-12,2025-04-02,2025-04-02,,,,,,0013800001I5mBfAAJ

Ashli M: Nope, we're all here.
Juliana J: Okay. Awesome. Sounds good. I.
Ashli M: will let you know that we did hire a replacement for David… Bassett's position. So she is an internal transfer, but it hasn't just happened on Friday. So we're still working out logistics, but eventually I'll want to get her involved in these calls, but I did want you to move forward with someone.
Juliana J: Awesome. That's good news. Yeah, definitely. Well, we'll talk about this kind of towards the end of the call, but I want to get a regular cadence going with you guys either every week or every other week depending on what your bandwidth. Looks like. So we'll definitely want to get her added into those calls. So, does she have prior or demo experience? It sounds like she was an internal hire. Yeah.
Ashli M: She does not have any demo experience. No, but she has done visualizations and so she's done visualizations through the Smartsheet dashboards as well as Power BI. So she has some visualization experience, but no, has not in Domo. So.
Juliana J: Okay. Good to know if we need to add any type of training or enablement to your roadmap. We do have a lot of training resources available to you guys right now as well. So, yeah, once you get her onboarded and everything, let me know if there's anything you think of that we can add to your roadmap to get her trained up.
Ashli M: Great news. Yeah, thank you. Yeah, we just, we added her into Domo and I've got her connected kind of to the university community for some of the free stuff. So she's taking a look at that as she's transitioning from her old role. So, okay.
Juliana J: And what's her name?
Ashli M: Her name is Mackenzie Connor.
Juliana J: Mackenzie Connor. Okay.
Ashli M: Awesome. And I'll send her contact information to you separately. So. Okay.
Juliana J: All right. Perfect. Looking forward to meeting her that's awesome.
Ashli M: Yeah. Okay.
Juliana J: All right. So today's, call, we really want to do some more discovery on that self service generation list. The goal of today's, call is so that we can produce a project proposal. It's kind of like a statement of work where we'll kind of scope out what we need to do for the project. And then we'll end up sending you that document back and just getting sign offs so that we can go ahead and start getting resources assigned. So with that being said, I think the best starting point would be if there's any, I know you had mentioned that your process right now is super manual for getting these lists put together. So I don't know Nick will help here and Brian walk through. But if you guys have a process that you want to walk through with us, that might be a good starting point.
Ashli M: Yeah, I just, I kind of want to just remind us and level set that like even though, you know, we've had Domo for a couple of years as a client. Like the things that we're doing now are kind of what we're just starting with, we have over the past couple of years kind of developed a strategy of if there's a list needed, we're just we had been sending it in excel. And so now what we're trying to accomplish is being able to create, you know, table cards where people can go out and self serve or download or have reports sent out to people on a regular cadence. So we are really like… I don't want you to get too excited about all the requirements that we're probably going to have in this because we just, it's more of a vision of some things that I want to be able to have available to the organization as opposed to a rule. This is kind of what we have. And this is how I want to upgrade it kind of thing. Is that making any sense?
Nik K: Yes, but we reserve the right to get excited, so.
Ashli M: Okay. Well, no, no, yeah, please. I just want, I just, I guess I'm just trying to level set of this like and it's probably more for me level setting because I have this like grandiose vision. I'm just trying to make sure we're going through the right steps. I'm getting too big, too quick, so.
Nik K: Okay. Yeah. So if you, do you have something to pull up and share in terms of what you do currently or I?
Ashli M: Think that probably the most relevant. I'll put Brian on the spot here. We have just recently. So as a kind of a historical record, there was a monthly list for our marketing team that was being used for them to send a survey out to our membership. And basically that selection was based upon a couple of letters at the beginning of the last name, and that was being done and retrieved manually and sent manually. I don't even think it was actually being done in Domo prior. So Brian has created something in Domo that allows for some self serve. So I'm gonna have him show that as what we've kind of quote unquote evolved. And then I think that would be a good foundation for the conversation.
Brian M: I'll go ahead and share my screen. Go ahead. All right. So, this is basically just a very simple list of members and their email got the main filter is to be able to filter on the last name initial, so they can come in if they want to send out emails to everyone with last name starting in qrr filter… it'll update given that also have filters for just some common sorting that is in the list. Generally, you only want to send emails to people who are not deceased who are over 18. By default. The list is sorted for people and not organizations… only those who have emails.

Abraham M: Yeah, awesome. All right. Well, thanks for the quick intro. So, Justin, thanks for the time. Really do appreciate it. I think we were trying to figure out all the renewal details, the credits and trying to get a good understanding of where we're going to be in the future as far as our legacy credits and our standard credits and what will kick off going from legacy to standard and trying to make sure that the renewal that we commit to for… the future is going to be aligned with the budget expectations. And if we make any changes that we do understand where that's going to increase or change our current structure? And with the research that Greg has done and the dashboard that you provided gave us a little bit of a better understanding of the different credits.
Greg H: Sorry.
Abraham M: There.
Justin L: we go. Now, you're back?
Abraham M: Yeah. So I got a call and it kicked me off my audio. So I lost my train of thought, but I think what I was hinting to is that we have a better understanding of the better structure, what is hitting the legacy versus the standard. But we still don't know what the variances are going to be from a budget perspective when we transition from legacy to standard or when we reduce the frequency and the refresh of the data. So, this call is for us to try to figure out those numbers so that we can either adjust accordingly higher as far as the renewal rates or make changes that we need to make and know that we're going to stay within the renewal rates for the upcoming year. Greg. I'll let you chime in as well with any other things.
Greg H: Yeah, that's exactly where we are. We're just trying to make sure we understand… like I've said numerous times, my concern is we're still actively developing and stuff in Domo, this mountain of legacy credits. And I do have concerns over if I make a change. You're like, oh, someone needs a new piece of data and we're just like, oh, well, that fits into this data set. I just need to add a column. Is that going to shift all these legacy credits into standard? And all of a sudden, we're like, oh no.
Justin L: We've.
Greg H: massively increased. So, yeah, I'm really looking for a better understanding of what could potentially trigger that. So when we're developing and thinking through what we're going to do, what impact it could have on our cost?
Justin L: Yeah. So here's my understanding and Megha can help or correct or tell me, I'm an idiot if I'm not articulating this correctly, right? So with all of your legacy credits right now, you guys have call… it 340,000 legacy credits annually. You're currently consuming approximately 22,000 legacy credits per month, right? So you're under with a few to spare which I think you're on a pretty good path there. If you make changes, obviously, what changes you make determines. So if you're not the changes that you would make that would affect that legacy credit usage is if you change the update frequency of those… all of those, all of the data sets or data flows that fall under your legacy credit usage category. Yeah. You'll use a former credit, some credits, but you, they won't that wouldn't change it to a standard credit. It'd just use a few more of the legacy credits. The only, the only time that something will, I don't even know if there's a scenario where it'll change from a legacy credit to a standard credit is if you took a legacy data set and combined it with a new data set and created, you know, something off from there. Yeah. Okay.
Greg H: Yeah. No. And well, and I, one thing I saw this week is, I was finally had some time to dig into a little more, you know, I saw a place where it looked like very, what was a data flow had multiple data sets and some of the data sets coming off of it were legacy.

They also addressed the availability of data, the need for scheduled reports, and the integration of data from various sources, including Paylocity and Lever, to provide a comprehensive view of HR performance. The group agreed to extend the Monday meeting to 1.5 hours to further discuss the roadmap and dashboard requirements.","Benjamin P: have you heard from Bellamy at all?
Bea G: Not this morning?
Benjamin P: Okay. I might just make sure that she's still giving me.
Bea G: Okay.
Benjamin P: There he is. Oh, there he is. Hey.
Bellamy Y: Guys. Hey.
Benjamin P: Bells. Hey, Bellamy. How?
Bellamy Y: Are you? Hi, Bea. Hi, Ben.
Bea G: Hi.
Bellamy Y: Hi, Ankit… amazing. I should probably turn on something too, take notes with gemini. Great. All right. Well, Bea, thanks for hopping on similarly to the Salesforce meeting. We're doing something with Domo team here as well. Obviously, the distinction between the two is that Salesforce is a lot more operational and process driven whereas Ben, what Domo is going to help us with is more in the realm of… analytics. So, if there are any metrics that you and your team usually hinges upon to do your operations to make any decisions or understand better about the employee retention rate, things like that, those are the conversation topics that we want to talk about today.
Bea G: Okay. So, do you basically and Bellamy, I'm just asking because I'm not really sure you want me to go over the analytics that we pull out of paylocity because that's essentially where we're pulling them out of anyways.
Bellamy Y: Okay. So, so it's like,
Bea G: turnover and turnover reasons by area and that kind of stuff?
Bellamy Y: Right. I can imagine that in terms of your departments and feel free to pitch in here and correct me. But like there will be two separate kind of purpose when it comes to analytics, number one is to manage the employees from human resource perspective. And then number two is to manage your team members workload in terms of productivity, you know, so that's some, those are the two realms that I think we can discuss a lot about.
Bea G: Yes, I don't know if, you know, I'd have to give some thought to the HR business partner analytics because I'll… just kind of give you guys an oversight of what we manage on a day to day with an HR. So not only the turnover metric, of course, is HR basics, right? We have to manage that and the reasons behind termination by job code and by region, we do that on a pretty consistent basis because that's how we know where to focus on where our fires are. We also focus on our growth percentage rate in each area, so that we are making sure that our hiring is staying commensurate with our volumes. So we use paylocity primarily for that. But what we do use out of Domo is the productivity metrics for individual employees. So that's something that the HR staff is really focused on. And the paafs do visit chart. Those are probably the three main metrics that we're using at this point ad hoc stuff which we do here. And then is the demographics as far as how we're sliced and diced of our demographics, male, female ethnicities, to make sure we're meeting our EEO standards. And then essentially like the retention and turnover rates are the other pieces of that. I don't know if that's another part Bellamy that you're interested in. I wasn't sure where you.
Bellamy Y: know, no, that's perfect. That's perfect. Because so if I didn't explain it correctly earlier or clarify a little bit more, we're trying to build a departmental dashboard for all the departmental heads. So this will be like HR's your dashboards more than anything.
Bea G: Oh, absolutely. Well, then I want to yeah.
Bellamy Y: Give us what you want and we'll get it. I want it by.
Bea G: Region. I want it by title. I want it by reason why they're leaving voluntary versus involuntary. And the reason codes behind it, that's my first and foremost, so that I can start to track those trends more appropriately… absolutely, would like to know the percentage of past due charts in each area on a trending basis because they're overall trending down. But I need to know which one of my areas is the most troublesome?
Bellamy Y: My.
Bea G: problem children, that, and the… productivity data for the areas as well. So I can see based off of and this would be best, Bellamy might be too much to ask by team if we could see the trending productivity data for each team. And I know we saw a little bit of that. Was Ziba did a dog and pony show for us through Domo. So I think that may already exist.
Bellamy Y: Okay, perfect. Yes, I imagine a lot of these like especially around productivity metrics we can just pull from what we have.
Bea G: Yeah, those would absolutely be like the dashboard key items. Yeah.
Bellamy Y: Okay.
Benjamin P: So, Bellamy, the data that we need to support these requests are coming from paylogsky and all of that's already in your demo. Is that what I'm hearing?
Bellamy Y: Yes. So productivity related data, then we have all that flowing in already from various sources in terms of retention, the turnover rates, reason why they're leaving voluntary involuntary by area. These kind of stuff. We need to set up the schedule report into your jupyter, Ben, and then process it that way to create data sets.
Bea G: So, Bellamy, so, you know, I just updated, this is an interesting conversation. I literally updated all the termination codes in paylocity this morning and.
Bellamy Y: Sent out.
Bea G: An email to my team and to finance on how they're going to use them going forward?
Bellamy Y: Oh, my God. Could you forward that to me? And we'll try to bake that same operational processes that you just set up into analytics?
Bea G: Okay. Historically mo has been putting in the termination codes and it just says resignation termination and I updated all the codes so that we can get more actual data.
Bellamy Y: Great. Okay. I'll share that.
Bea G: With you. Okay?
Bellamy Y: Other request B, I would.
Bea G: Like to be able in the future to slice certain productivity data by employment type. I know that's always been a conversation that comes up but I don't think that's a dashboard thing that's just more data.
Bellamy Y: I think that's a filter thing. Yeah, we can make that and then have a filter for the employment type so that you can see the same metrics in different filters.
Bea G: Okay. Let me just pull Bob's addendum too.

Bellamy Y: Yeah, pretty much… nothing like Wednesday night, late night cereal. Yeah… I hope they're joining Kevin. So this particular meeting is for Domo team. They're the analytics team. Okay? So, the visualizations and different… types of analytics that you want to request to be a part of your departmental dashboard is the purpose of this call. It's a requirement gathering call. Yeah, let me just double check if they're freaking joining.

Kevin P: God.
Bellamy Y: It's crazy.
Kevin P: Yeah.
Bellamy Y: There they come. Hi, Ben. You're muted?
Benjamin P: Hello?
Bellamy Y: Yeah, we can hear you. Hi, Ziba.
Kevin P: Hey, everyone. All.
Bellamy Y: Right. Domo team, Ben and Ankit please meet Kevin. You guys already met Ziba, Kevin's our new head of Ta, he is going to kind of lay down what the dashboard requirements could be. And, yes, because this is a brand new generation, we can expect some crudeness to this dashboard, which is totally fine. We can just continue to build on top of that. But just the biggest thing is that we want to have core metrics just visible from day one, just so that Kevin can have some of those real time data that he needs to understand different hiring needs left. And right? So then after all these requirement gathering sessions, Ben will get together and do some debriefing to understand where the data is coming from, which data we need to pull, where, and how, and so we'll do all that. This session. I'm going to have Ziba share her screen after she comes back in a minute because she prepared a documentation requirements document for these… meetings. So we're going to go off on that and try to see if there's anything else that we want to add or subtract.
Kevin P: sounds good.
Bellamy Y: Yeah, Ziva, whenever you're ready, please.
Kevin P: How you guys doing today? Good?
Bellamy Y: Pleasure to meet you, Kevin.
Kevin P: Likewise. It feels like it should be Friday. So, I'm kind of bummed there's another day. We have to do this… before the weekend. I,
Bellamy Y: agree… Kevin.
Benjamin P: Where are you based? Are you in California?
Kevin P: Yeah, the east bay? Oh, cool. Yeah. How about you guys?
Benjamin P: We're all over the place. Okay? You're in Delaware… northeast, Delaware and I'm in Georgia all.
Kevin P: Right. Well, I grew up on the east coast. I was born in New York City and grew up in New Jersey.
Bellamy Y: Ziba, could you share your screen and show us the document?
Z S: Yes, yes, yes.
Bellamy Y: Documentation of documents?
Z S: Okay. Yes. I have it's a JPG now because my whiteboarding… trial has ended. Actually. Let me just show you in, the full documents where we have all the requirements and Google docs. So let me pull that up.
Benjamin P: Is this one of the ones you had started on yet or is this one of the ones where we?
Bellamy Y: This is the same one that we try to give you access on. And then Shane requested with his personal Gmail. So we declined.
Z S: Yeah.
Bellamy Y: Got it. We'll ship this all over to you guys after this whole thing is done.
Benjamin P: Sounds good.
Bellamy Y: Yeah, Ziba, I want us to listen in to Kevin and Ben's conversation and try to like add or subtract things. But if you could walk us through with what you have right now?
Z S: Absolutely. So I'll just go straight to, the… mock up… okay? Sorry, hopefully, you guys can see that there is some feedback I got from Kevin as well with some stuff to add and remove. So I'll walk through that. So just quickly the filters, we hope to have a territory filter, the employee filter and a discipline filter since we hire different disciplines like RN, SN, etc, sorry, st, and… getting feedback from Jason and Tiana and other HR or other Ta, people. They said it would be useful to have just total number of open roles right? At the top average employee stay, number of offers signed this week that's more of a nice to have. So, these two are more important than that reasons for termination, a nice pie chart or something similar would be useful. 90 day survey feedback. And then this is kind of the map that we were talking about earlier high priority roles. So, this maybe may not necessarily go here but, just to have some kind of map of California or whatever territories we're in to see like red are very high priority roles we need to hire here immediately versus yellow, maybe lower priority.
Bellamy Y: That's the Kepler, Ben that we just talked about.
Z S: Yeah. So that would be the same, average… time to fill certain roles from job posting to acceptance. And also, I'll go over all the sources of data in a second as well, employees… getting bonus. So this is very useful if we can filter it by Ta manager because I think Ta, managers really want to know like what percent of their employees are getting bonuses that's a metric that they really care about. And this, I think I got mixed feedback on this, Kevin. I don't know, I don't know if you find this useful, we can maybe skip on this for now.
Bellamy Y: This is going to be baked into that Kepler map together.
Z S: Okay. Yeah, that would be a better idea. And the last two, so something like source of hire and resume experience versus job performance. So that data would also like, a lot of these would be coming from lever. And then number of employee churn. This is also something that's very useful for some reason my lines are not showing up, but this would be a bar chart where we'd have like something like this. Oh, I can't do it from here. Okay. Never mind. But it'd be some kind of bar chart where we'd see like the count of total employees that have churned after one month, two months, three months, and then up to six months, maybe even another one for six m",Consumption Pricing Model,51200.0,Corporate,21HHS.COM,1,Healthcare & Health Services,25,$25M to <$50M,Upsell,Blank,Closed Won,Justin Labrum,2025-08-12,2025-06-26,2025-08-12,2025-08-12,2025-08-12,2025-08-12,2025-08-12,2025-08-07,001Vq000005wsrZIAQ

We're coming from another meeting. It's one of those days.
Benjamin P: Hey, guys. How's everybody doing?
Julia C: Oh, not too bad yourself?
Benjamin P: I'm doing well. So, I want to first… thank… Michelle for getting me access to MRT cloud. So that was, I was able to log in successfully, this morning. And so, we're good there. At some point, I probably will need, a little bit, of guidance, and direction, just navigating through mip, and sort of the areas that, we'll want to focus on, but I also wanted, to show a couple things today. So, if you just bear with me one moment and I will, I'm going to get something pulled up. Okay. All right. So, since the beginning of this engagement, whenever we've started, one of the things that we discussed, pretty frequently at the beginning was, is the idea of a roadmap. And the reason we, do this is so that we can, help provide just a, an overview of, the services that we're providing, the use cases we've identified, and the business goals, that we're hoping to address. But also provide a little bit more detail on the use cases that we're executing. And so, I've started on a roadmap. This is something that we can deliver to you, and send it over so that you can sort of take a look at it and walk through. And the idea is, we really want to just ensure that we're aligned on, the use cases, that we're tackling and I know that right now, the only use case that we're really focused on is, this ap, automation. And so we've received some invoices. We've done some testing. I can actually show you on, today, an example of how we can quickly obtain, a lot of those key data points from, the PDF that you sent over. So we'll leave a few minutes at the end. So I can just show you, how quickly and how easily we can do that inside the demo platform. But I want to first, just, show you the roadmap that we've built out, sort of share, the things that we've gathered and the notes that we've taken, around the roadmap, and just get your feedback. If there's if there's holes in it, if there's something that we're missing, if we're misaligned, now's the time so that, we can just align and make sure that we're executing this in a way that's going to provide the most value for you guys. So, does that sound like, a good plan for everybody on the call?
Michelle C: Yes.
Julia C: Yeah, I think so.
Benjamin P: Wonderful. So… we've got this roadmap here and I'll just jump right to the use cases here, that we've identified. So there's really I'm going to, I'm actually going to go to slide six and then come back. So automated invoice processing is I've got it in orange because that's the one that we're really focused on throughout the discussions that we've had up until now we've talked about briefly talked about a couple of other areas that we can help. I've not highlighted those as a primary use case that we're tackling right now because I know that we're really just focused on one but I still wanted to include these so that we don't lose sight of them and don't lose visibility. And also to ensure that once we get past this first one, we can determine which of these are highest priority or if these are still a priority at all. And so automated invoice processing is the first one. I've got this automated payroll allocation that Linh brought up early on as a potential area where we can potentially improve some of your existing processes. And then a financial performance dashboard. So just providing better visibility not just in the ap as it relates to financials, but finance as a whole, all of your different accounting departments, accounts, receivable, cash income… statement, that sort of thing. And in fact, we actually have data out of the box data products for financial dashboards that we can show you and do a demo to see if there's any interest there. And those data products that financial dashboard is sort of just we plug in your finance data and all of that has been pre built for you. And so that's something that we can certainly do a demo of in the future. If you guys determine that this financial reporting is still something that would provide a lot of value. I'm going to jump back over to slide four. That this is just provides a better more in depth description of what it is that we're trying to tackle. And so the first priority, the one, the first on the list is the workflow and demo to capture the invoice PDFS and use OCR to extract most key data points. And so the data points we talked about invoice date, we talked about due date, vendor, the total amount due. There's different things like that we would hope to capture. And so all of that would be extracted from the PDFS. I know that there's some excel files as well. So we can handle those a little bit differently since they're not PDF format. We can certainly handle that. And then integrating that with mip. And so on the last call, Shane shared the documentation that mip has for their API endpoints that will allow us to automatically write these invoices back to your ap system. Once the user who's actually entering these has the ability to go in and validate them.

But again, we don't have too many opportunities to really kind of work with the business. So interested to hear really what are you using in Domo today? What is it that you use? And kind of what is it for?
Josh D: Well, I mean if you're asking like what cards do I use most often? I mean, I use Domo throughout the day all day every day. It's open. It's one of my windows open. It's the first window. I open every morning. It's the last window I close in the evenings from home. Awesome. Okay. Yeah, it's I mean, it's our main reporting structure as of now and I hear that's changing. But as of right now, that's the main one that I use. We've talked about cards. I use a myriad of different cards every day from a first part of the morning. I mean, first thing in the morning, I use Domo to build a recap for my team of the previous day's, business. Starting with the sales dashboard. I use sales detail and get sales for the last seven days, next seven days, I use mobile… which one is it in store orders? That 210 dash 15 to see what mobile orders we placed the day before. I use Omni retail every morning to track my short, my Omni performance from a short pitch perspective. I check my average ticket for the previous seven days and out of store operations. After that, I check transactions, also out of store operations. I check gearguard for the week to date numbers… gearguard reporting, also in store operations. Then I check all my roundup reporting out of store ops for the day, week month and year, that roundup reporting card. I check TMBC sales for all the categories first thing every morning it goes into my recap. And then obviously, I go into my club numbers club performance for the previous day, for the week month year, I use another card for a club performance by outfitter who's getting club applications where they are for the week, month and year. And then I check my zero list out of that card. The outfitter's card who's on my zero list for the week, the month, the year, all that gets updated into my build. All this goes in… regurgitating right now goes into a one pager. I send to my management team. All that goes into a spreadsheet that I've developed. I just copy and paste the info over there so I can send it all to them. Basically what my priorities are. So that's all first thing in the morning that's all that I just went through. I probably missed a couple, but all that is within the first 20 25 minutes of my day, 20 25 minutes of my day. It takes me about that long to build a, to build a recap for my team. Then throughout go ahead.
Casey D: No, keep going. This is great.
Josh D: Yeah. Throughout the day, there's a few cards that I look at throughout the day. The one that I, the two that I toggle between the most are real time sales. I look at real time sales. I would say a minimum of twice per hour. I check it either on my desktop or on my phone to see where we are in sales for the day and club store, current day, same thing at least a couple of times an hour. I update, I open that card and see where we're sitting for the day. Then based on what I've seen there, I may go in and open up a couple other cards within that card, see where we are in comparison to the region, sometimes comparison to the company, I'll check that a few times a day as well just to track our performance there. I'm in the ukg… dimensions reports. I'm in there, the labor versus sales a minimum of once a day. I generally that one doesn't update quite as fast as I like. I think there's some information transfers that are a little bit slower. But normally, it gives me all the information I need by about nine 30 in the morning. I usually start refreshing it at about 915. Just waiting for that data download. That's what gives me my that's where I track where I'm trending with my payroll for the week month year based relative to my sales performance. And then so all of those cards that I just made everything I just went through, I'm in a minimum of once and many of those cards several times a day, several times a day. And there's other reporting that I just check on a more irregular basis as the needs arise. You know, I say weekly, I'm going into my shrink reporting and seeing what my markouts have been so far that week where my trend is there. I'll occasionally go into my tracker GM dashboard just to make sure I don't just looking for a few flags in there. But once a week, I'll go into the 210 sales dashboard. One. I only use that one once a week. But yeah, because I like that how that card, I can pick specific fiscal weeks I want to look at and it gives me combined totals. So it's really nice for when I'm comparing wanting to establish what my sales trend is, say I want to look at a six week or a 10 week trend to see if my payroll because that tells me dial in my payroll forecasting what's this trend, telling me the recent trend, telling me that my store is doing versus, you know, holistically you know, I could be, I could be running up two percent for the year, but in the last six weeks, I'm up 12, I need to plan labor accordingly for that. Okay? So I have to report for that. Okay, anyway, I just puked a lot of information at you real fast. No, I love it.

The key points were that Civitas is concerned about the significant increase in the renewal cost, from less than $100,000 to $200,000, and Simeon acknowledged the concern and agreed to work with Karlie to develop a proposal that addresses the cost issue while ensuring Domo remains a valuable partner for Civitas.","Simeon N: you, Carly, how's it going?
Karlie D: Good. How are you?
Simeon N: Good. Hey, Dakota. Thanks for jumping on.
Dakota P: Hey, y'all.
Simeon N: how's life?
Dakota P: Same old, same old. How about you? Same old?
Simeon N: Just looking at eagles out the window. Yeah, yeah.
Dakota P: They've been staying away for the most part. We got a woodpecker now, which is pretty cool. But.
Simeon N: Oh, no way. Carly, Dakota's up in Washington and he's got, I mean, from the stories I've heard, it sounds like he's got quite an active outdoors beyond the window of his office. So, he saw an eagle scoop a Fish out of a water and take it to a tree. And just, you know, front row seat. Oh, yeah.
Dakota P: Yep.
Karlie D: You have a pretty exciting seat?
Dakota P: Yeah, we live next to, there's the two big lakes over here, lake Washington and lake, sammamish. We live next to lake sammamish. And so, we get, a lot of the wildlife traffic comes around.
Karlie D: Oh, that's awesome. Yeah.
Dakota P: Yeah, a lot of ducks, a lot of geese, lots of birds, yeah.
Simeon N: Yeah, that's super cool. And, and Dakota, I don't think you've met Carly before, but, I would love for her to introduce herself. So, we, we've had a couple of changes on the demo side as far as just like account assignments from a customer success standpoint, and it's actually, in my perspective, I think it's going to be really good, just because it just helps with alignment across accounts. So, I mean, this is all boring stuff that you probably don't care about, but it's just like, yeah, I would like me as a sales rep, I would have like a book of accounts, but across those accounts, I wouldn't have the same CSM partnership, like I'd have like 10 or so different csms. So it was kind of hard to have alignment on all of our customers. Now with Karlie, her, and I get to work across the majority of my entire book. So that's going to be really cool. And so, I think that you're going to love Karlie, people at Domo, love her, but Karlie, if you don't mind jumping in and saying, hi.
Karlie D: And I apologize. My voice is not fully here today. My kids went back to school and it took about two days until I got sick, so I'm trying to recover but yeah, thank you Simeon. So my name's Karlie. I have been at Domo for just about five years. I've been in a few different departments, so I feel really lucky in that aspect. I've got to know Domo in a lot of different ways, but I definitely feel like working with customers has been my favorite. So this is definitely the role for me. I'm excited to work with your account and learn a lot more. I do live in the northern part of Utah, a little bit closer to Idaho. I'm about two hours away from our headquarters. I don't go in as often as I probably should, but I do go in here and there. So if you ever do come to headquarters, I'll meet you down there and take you out to dinner or something like that. But I don't see a lot of cool birds. We do get some hawks but.
Dakota P: Oh, yeah.
Simeon N: It's a cool bird.
Karlie D: Yeah. In the winter, I get a ton of deer though. I get deer in my yard, very cool.
Dakota P: I.
Karlie D: have to check my yard before letting the dogs out. So.
Dakota P: Very cool. Yeah.
Simeon N: Yeah, that's awesome. Carly. Thank you. Thanks for jumping on. I haven't so let's see. I haven't seen Daniel join Dakota and then also.
Dakota P: I think we invited Austin, but I know that they're.
Simeon N: yeah, we invited Austin. They're doing trainings. Okay. Yeah, mainly this is, it's not supposed, it's not meant to be like an overly formal conversation just kind of, you know, temperature check, make sure, you know, things are good for you guys and how we want to like plan future, you know? And I guess just understanding what you guys are doing with Domo as a partner. How can we best support that? Sorry, I was getting a call as I was talking, how can we best support your, you know, your development and you servicing the business and Carly, just so, you know, working with Dakota, you'll like grow to understand like Dakota pretty much services the entire business on its own like through Domo which is pretty cool. And there's a lot of neat stuff that he's doing. You have an intern, right? Dakota now? Is that going? Or was it you that had an intern or you have a new somebody that you're ramping up?
Dakota P: Yeah. So we have an intern, but I was even talking to Daniel about that yesterday. For the most part. I've been kind of hands off with it. She has been using Domo to create content, build dashboards and stuff like that. But as far as I'm aware, we're not exactly in the same department, same role. I think she's more business focused whereas I'm more technical focused. So she's been working a little bit closer with Austin who's kind of like our operational head of the company. He keeps everything moving. So she's been working with him. And then I'm not too sure about timeline on her internship. I don't know if she'll be staying on with us afterwards, but yeah, she's kind of been off in her own little world and I've been off in my own little world. So that's just kind of where we're at with that.
Simeon N: Yeah, no problem. Just totally just helps us kind of understand the nature of that and how we can help support, you know, a new member of the team. And even if it's a temporary thing. So, Daniel, the man of the hour. Thanks for jumping on.
Daniel S: Good morning.
Simeon N: Yeah. Good morning to you as well. Hopefully life is good in Texas.
Daniel S: Yes, absolutely.
Simeon N: No complaints. Yeah, none. Awesome. Well, we just kind of went through a quick round of introductions because Karlie is new to the account on the Domo side, but she's going to be your customer success manager and you'll love working with her. We love working with Dakota and your team. So shouldn't be too much different than what we're used to, you know, over the last year or two. But yeah, thanks for jumping on today.

Aishwarya D: Hey, Kyle.
Kristine F: Just in case you're not aware. I'll message you.
Eric G: Okay. Sounds good. Hey, guys. Good morning.
Vu N: Good.
Ankit S: Morning.
Brian W: Hey, good morning, everyone.
Ankit S: Thanks for the flexibility with moving this meeting today of.
Eric G: Course. No problem.
Ankit S: I'm guessing we're still waiting for a few others Vu?
Eric G: Yeah. I think Vu is probably the one that we need the most, but it kind of depends on what the run of show is because we may not need him for everything more of the technical… side.
Ankit S: Gotcha. I would say we can probably just get started since this will be a bit of a shorter session. So.
Eric G: One.
Ankit S: Thing we synced on yesterday internally was just talking through the remaining visuals. Yep. So we were able to get an overage approved. So just to get some extra hours, we got a 10 percent overage which amounts to five extra hours… still going to be some things that are going to be a bit incompleted from what we discussed yesterday, but I know there was kind of an expectation that this bucket that we worked on wasn't going to cover completely everything that we were going to work on in terms of the visualizations, and then also just other data that we're planning to bring in over time. Yeah. So just in terms of, I guess details around the visuals and how much we'll have that done, I'll turn that over to aish and Christine to talk about. And then we can also just talk about in the coming weeks next bucket whenever that happens, what to prioritize there. I think it would be good to kind of just kind of have a roadmap for that.
Eric G: I agree. I think we should come out of this meeting with a good idea of like what will be done? And when that way we can kind of set our expectations appropriately on like these are the things that we'll have to put some more work into. And this is what will be ready right away.
Ankit S: Yeah, for sure. One other quick update, end of this month, aish will be rolling off this account. We'll bring in another business consultant at that time if Christine needs. So, trying to utilize her as much as we can between now and the end of the month sounds.
Eric G: Good.
Ankit S: And so we'll work through those changes as they come, but just wanted to give everyone a heads up. Okay? We're all still in denial about it.
Eric G: Well, she's been great so far.
Brian W: Yeah. Glad to see you go.
Vu N: Hey, everyone. Sorry, I'm a couple minutes late.
Eric G: I'm sorry, I haven't missed much. We're just talking about kind of next step, you know, working to determine next steps and timing on the visualizations.
Vu N: Got it.
Brian W: I guess with that said, I think we shared the excel file that does like all the calculations for those visuals because do you all have those?
Eric G: We have the original one?
Kristine F: Did you send a new one last week with the new updated powerpoint?
Brian W: I can send the excel file that backs it up, but the math is exactly the same. Yeah.
Eric G: Nothing's changed. I don't think so. If you're working off the original, you should be good.
Brian W: Yeah, should be fine. Yeah.
Kristine F: Yeah, just a heads up that's a pretty robust excel sheet.
Brian W: Yeah, it.
Kristine F: Is remembering back my days of finance. So just from a business perspective, you're probably very familiar with what we're going. So, you know, I think we've got found for what we need now, but it is very time consuming to go from one cell to, this tab. So we might just want to do some checks and see where we're missing. So, Aishwarya and I will take that on and just say, hey, what are we missing? And let's have you verify because we don't want to, I mean, you know, your business, you know, what you're doing in those spreadsheets. We just want to make sure that we're not messing something up because we didn't follow the right logic in the excel formulas.
Eric G: Yep. Absolutely. I.
Brian W: Think that's fair. And I'd say, yeah, those formulas give me a headache quite often.
Kristine F: Yeah, yes. Sorry, go ahead. No, go ahead.
Brian W: I will say this as well. Like if you look at like all the visuals that are in the excel. I mean, there's a lot, but we only show on like the standard deck a handful of them. So I'd say, I mean, y'all can check me on this, but like, I don't think every single one of those has to be built for like this.
Eric G: Right. I think we talked through that on the last call too. Okay. The slide deck, if you guys recall and said, hey, it's really these slides like whatever it was. I can't remember the number that we and.
Kristine F: There was a new deck last week, right? Is that the one you went through? Eric? No?
Eric G: It's the same deck.
Kristine F: Okay. I thought I saw a new one. Sorry?
Eric G: I mean, we may have sent like the June version, it's the same visually.
Aishwarya D: The new deck has a couple of additional slides.
Eric G: Yeah. The forecast stuff I think we talked about is not something you guys will be able to build right away because I don't think we've got any of that data in Domo, but everything else, the kind of recurring slides we always do should be unchanged?
Kristine F: Okay, great. Yeah, I haven't had a chance to listen to that. So Ankit, if you could send last week, just make sure I have that and we'll make sure we're aligned and see where we have any gaps.
Ankit S: Yes, sure thing. I'll just forward that again.
Kristine F: Thank you. Sorry, it's been a little rough coming back from vacation.
Eric G: That's okay. No, I think all good. No.
Ankit S: Worries at all. All, right. Sorry, Eric. You're going to say something?
Eric G: No, I don't think so. Yeah, I think maybe it would be helpful to get an update on kind of like where we are in those visualizations, like where you're getting stuck, aish, if anywhere, and like timing on when… we think they'll be complete. So we can kind of review them with you to Christine's point and make sure that they are all accurate and working the right way.

Kevin W: Oh, it's going fine. Summer just has passed us by, unfortunately, it did.
Jill O: It did. I'm sorry, Kevin, I don't remember, do you have kids at home?
Kevin W: Technically, yes, but it's my youngest daughter. She's working at Domo. She's an intern.
Jill O: Oh, how convenient.
Kevin W: Yeah, I know. And her apartment situation last year with her roommates at college, it really set up very well for her to have a home office. It was small. Oh.
Jill O: Nice.
Kevin W: So, she moved back home so she could work back home, and we set up one of the empty bedrooms because the other one's living in Chicago to… accommodate her working, have a home office. Oh.
Jill O: Nice.
Kevin W: But I would expect that sometime this year. She'll probably get her own place and have her own home office.
Jill O: Well, just fair warning. I've been expecting that for about four years. So… yeah, mine's.
Kevin W: still here? Yeah.
Jill O: Honestly, I don't mind. I tell him all the time. I'm like listen, don't spend your money, you know, if you, because he.
Kevin W: I have kind.
Jill O: Of an apartment scenario and my like my basement has its own office or its own entrance and stuff. So, I'm like why spend rent? You're fine.
Kevin W: Yeah, no, it's kind of the same situation too. We like having her around. It's no big deal.
Jill O: Yeah, he's great. My younger son and I, we're super close. They can play video games and whatever, you know, it just works out really well.
Kevin W: No, and it's not like she's a financial burden here. She's making money. She's living her best life. She's just trying to figure out where she wants to live and you know, she doesn't want to stay here. So, she's trying to figure out what city to go to and stuff. So, and if she goes, it's chances, I'll probably, I may probably end up selling this place anyway because I don't need it anymore. So we kind of want to downsell anyway. So.
Jill O: Well, that works. Yeah.
Kevin W: That.
Jill O: works that works. Well. Good deal. All right. I think I have juice now… you're.

Kevin W: Good. It's busy. We're in our quiet period, so I can't talk to you about how our last quarter finished, but everyone's pretty happy around here. So, yeah, it's very busy. I know things have been particularly rough on your side of the business.
Jill O: From a stock price perspective, absolutely, it's been very hard the whole industry, but it's certainly, you know, our labor situation is so difficult.
Kevin W: Yeah.
Jill O: I don't know if you heard, but I kind of have a different job. Well, let me rephrase that. It's not different because I still have my entire old job, but I have, I've now run the U. S operation as well.
Kevin W: Okay.
Jill O: So, they gave me that about maybe a month ago, a little over.
Kevin W: More work, same pay.
Jill O: Oh, yeah. You know, how it goes but it's good because, you know, I've always wanted to go back to ops. I started my career in operations.
Kevin W: Yeah.
Jill O: And I've always wanted to be able to take what I've learned over the years in all the different roles I've had and go back and apply it.
Kevin W: Yeah.
Jill O: So, it's kind of good. In that regard. I'm excited about the opportunity because, you know, it's kind of going back to my roots, but at the same time, I'm able to, I have such a different skill set than I did before. So, it's, really been good. I'm really excited about it.
Kevin W: Good.
Jill O: So, it's a lot. I mean, it's a lot to do for sure because like I said, I didn't lose any of my other responsibility but my other team, the global ops support team that I had before, you know, still have with luxted and the others, they're really in good shape. So, you know, we can do a lot with a little bit less of my time.
Kevin W: Good stuff.
Jill O: Yeah. So, I did have a few things for you.
Kevin W: Okay.
Jill O: I wanted to let you know first and foremost, we started working on our side on the contract. I am really hopeful that we can get a three year agreement. I've talked to Amit about this, you know, quite a bit. So I need to follow up on that, but Amit's kind of running that for me so we'll hopefully get that moving forward. Okay, start that now because, you know, we ran out of time last year, which is what landed us in a one year agreement. I don't I really don't want that. I've got, I've already given all my asks to procurement. So they'll be, hopefully, have they reached out to you at all?
Kevin W: No, they haven't and do you want me, should I, or should you maybe reach out to Amit and have him reach out to me? How do you want to handle it?
Jill O: Well, I think procurement, it's Mike massotti is the Guy I'm working.
Kevin W: With, I know Mike. Yeah.
Jill O: Okay. Reach out to Mike because he has all my stuff and you can tell him we talked, say, hey, Jill talked, asked me to reach out to you because we want to go ahead and start negotiating the renewal.
Kevin W: Should I CC Amit on that?
Jill O: Yeah. And me. Yeah. Okay. I'll.
Kevin W: CC you both.
Jill O: Yeah, that'll work and then we can go from there.
Kevin W: Okay. Can do that.
Jill O: Okay. All right. That's for me. The biggest Domo thing. I do have the governance team, you know, looking at the credits and all the stuff and we're tracking out kind of how we planned. So from that side, I think I'm doing okay.
Kevin W: Yeah, we're right now projected in my sort of cockpit that we'd run some calculations. It's saying that you're going to be at current pacing about 18,000 credits and overages, which is nothing I'm worried about. Okay, I will negotiate that into next year's contract. So good. I mean.

Sonja D: I'm good. How are you?
Dan H: Ah, I'm good. We're hosting Domo's… connection tour at our headquarters today. So we've got a couple 100 extra customers and people here running around, which is fun.
Sonja D: Yeah, that's cool.
Dan H: Yeah, yeah. The.
Sonja D: Closest one for me was in Chicago, so I had not going to head up there for that, but I.
Dan H: did see Calvin in Minneapolis. I was there. Yep. Cool. And ran into him, talked to him for a minute.
Sonja D: Awesome. That.
Dan H: Was cool.
Sonja D: Hey, so just so you know, we have a new analyst that has joined us. Her name is Libby gestaitis, and I forwarded the invite to her just like a minute ago because I hadn't, thought I did it before, but I didn't see her name on it. So she may or may not join today. But if you could update the invite to remove Lily and add Libby, that would.
Dan H: Yeah. Let me do this right now, this and all following events. So remove, Lily, is Lily no longer with you guys, right?
Sonja D: Yep. Okay.
Dan H: And tell me you… said it was Libby?
Sonja D: Libby. LIBB y gastitis but her, it's just L and then it's GUSTITIS at leaf health G.
Dan H: TUSTITIS at leafhealth net. Yep.
Sonja D: Yep. All.
Dan H: right. Libby gustitis, bent. So she should have, she should be on this one and everyone moving forward. So.
Sonja D: Very cool. I apologize for not getting you an agenda in advance but this was kind of a carryover. So it's not new but related to the logos and our production environment versus the dev… environment. I wanted to run by you kind of what I did, but now, I feel like I'm I ran into a snag. So let me share this screen. So… are you seeing the customer logo? I?
Dan H: Am, yeah, okay. So.
Sonja D: When I, so I went through and I basically created, I recreated the table, which I thought was one of our options because here's the image name and urls from the promoted into production… right? Because.
Dan H: All the urls are the leafhealth nets, doma. Com.
Sonja D: Exactly the issue that I just realized after I did all of this, is that this data set, well, I guess maybe it's not an issue, but let me go to the dashboard. Sorry, the app.
Dan H: Yeah, there you go.
Sonja D: So… I would edit this and then I would take, I think I figured out what my issue was, and then I would go into here and I would edit an analyzer.
Dan H: Yeah, which?
Sonja D: And then I would point it to the new image… top.
Dan H: One. Yeah.
Sonja D: Okay. I hadn't gotten that far. I just, I got all the logos done and then I'm like, well, wait a second. How's that going to work? So, as per usual, I figured it out on my own now with that said there is now this is blank… and,
Dan H: we.
Sonja D: so, the default should be?
Dan H: Oh, it's probably just the same color.
Sonja D: Oh, that's it, that is.
Dan H: Probably just can't see it?
Sonja D: I just don't know if I,
Dan H: can you apply a filter for, just to make sure?
Sonja D: Yeah. Give me one second. I think, I just don't know if I have the white logo for leaf health where's my, I… can just fix it that way. Here we go. Yeah, that's this is all I need to do. Copy image link… and then data. Now, I'm going to have to.
Dan H: Just change it right there.
Sonja D: Change it on this one. Did it, do it?
Dan H: If you're curious, you can delete it and then paste it.
Sonja D: Oh, yeah. Good point. Okay. I'll have to do that with more than this, but this will at least get us to the default. Well, that didn't work out what happened. Well now?
Dan H: It's just all white. What in the world?
Sonja D: I didn't even do that. Here we go. There. We go. Okay. So I'll just have to update the rest of the table. Okay? Figured it out. Should be good. And then you wanted to test it. The issue. This one should work. No data and filtered.
Dan H: You don't have all the,
Sonja D: no. Here's, the issue is that we are switching over data sets. And so that data set, I don't think we have one for it's not matching like the,
Dan H: oh, the values.
Sonja D: Yeah, all of these are getting up like this should be point C or point C health… or something like that. So I'm just going to have to play around with it, but at least I know what I was supposed to do there. So it's not any worse than it was before. I just got to now start playing with it. We're going to switch the data set out here this week. And so I think we're ready to go with our new data governance stuff. All right. So that was that. And then other than… that, I don't know if I really have anything for you. Specifically, so, have.
Dan H: you started to get some users in there yet, or is that still just a super slow roll?
Sonja D: We are dependent on our account team for getting it promoted and identifying the people to use it. And we've offered our time and it just has not happened. So I'm going to be pushing again… I guess on Monday when I talked, well, not on Monday because I'm off on Monday, but it's… really up to Hugh. So I'll have to circle back with him and we have a meeting, right?
Dan H: After moving at a glacial pace.
Sonja D: Yeah, it's unfortunate. But with that said?
Dan H: Is Hugh your CEO?
Sonja D: No, he's our senior vice president of growth. He's our chief growth officer.
Dan H: Got it.
Sonja D: So, he should have some skin in this game, but so… but hasn't taken that push yet. But we do have a meeting this afternoon. It's called the best practices meeting. So I will bring it up at the call.
Dan H: Okay. Best practice number one, get people to use our stuff.
Sonja D: Yeah. You know, and the thing, the reason why I haven't really been like beating the drum on it is that we have gone through this, very large expansion of our Salesforce into our groups, getting group level data into Salesforce. And actually, I do have one thing we could probably talk about related to that, but the… switch over. So we have it connected to our data and we haven't like I have to switch that data set over to the new data set. And there's a little bit involved in that because we added, you know, new fields that have like Salesforce id in it and things like that.

Jake offered Domo's support to showcase use cases and prove the value of Domo, should the new leadership want to evaluate the current setup, and Spencer agreed to provide Jake's contact information to the relevant Apex team members. The call also covered Domo's connections tour and the potential for Apex to utilize Domo's adoption engine and resources to enhance their technical capabilities.","Spencer M: good. How are you doing, Jake?
Chris S: Good morning.
Jake W: Looks like we probably got most that will be joining really this morning. A meeting could be, I think pretty quick unless there's things that you guys have to bring up. But, you know, my main thing is to first just check in to see if there's any active projects we can help with. But then also, you know, kind of, you know, get some feedback on our adoption team and, you know, kind of, you know, how you're feeling about that?
Spencer M: Yeah. So I don't think we have any widespread new projects, just things that are normal. Just build some reports, get them out to the teams we are seeing as I think we told you before a few more departments and teams coming to us. Mostly we have our health and safety team which Brian has been helping and leading them get content into Domo and we're getting towards building out some reports for our HR teams as well. So beyond slowly crawling out beyond finance. So those are going well. The adoption engine is slow just mostly as we wait and we waited for our new CTO CIO to replace Jim and we did have him start this week. So Jake I'll pass his contact information on to you. And since it's his first week, we didn't have him join this call, but next month we'll try and get him on. It will work with you to kind of reestablish him as our executive sponsor.
Jake W: Yeah, that's great. And where it's his first week, I'm sure you don't know, but does it seem like I mean every leader kind of has a different approach. Does it feel like? You know, he wants to kind of enable what's already there? Or is there going to be an evaluation period? Don't?
Spencer M: Know we, Ryan and I have been on one team meeting not just for the whole it team where he just did his little introduction. And beyond that, that's all we know, Chris, you might have had a little bit more interaction or have an idea of what Keith is kind of looking to do or you might be in the dark like us.
Chris S: Well, yeah, honestly, I did meet with him but honestly he's only this is his third day. Yeah.
Jake W: So,
Chris S: he's overwhelmed and trying to figure everything out, but I mean, there's definitely he comes from several other companies and has other ideas and other exposure to other things. So he might have, some ideas.
Spencer M: Yeah. So, Jake, his last company, he was living and based out of Singapore and so he's both starting new job and moving back to the states all at the same time. So, he's got quite a bit on his plate to start in but not to say that we shouldn't just leave him be. But just so you kind of know he's got a busy month ahead of him doing both of those simultaneously.
Jake W: Yeah, absolutely. And you know, I'm just keep us in the loops a lot of times when leadership changes, right? They want to do a review of everything. And if they're not familiar, we just want to be able to support if it makes sense, to be able to show certain things, prove out, use cases that maybe your… organization currently isn't doing. But other companies that we help support are. And so if, that comes up, we'd love to kind of get ahead of that and help as well.
Spencer M: Yep. And so that, that'll make sense. I'll send you the contact information we Brian myself. And I think Kyle haven't had any direct contact with him about a bi solution or anything. So I don't know if you feel it's best just to reach out proactively on your behalf, if you'd rather wait for us to kind of talk about Jomo, I'm not too sure what you feel would be a better approach, but we can do take your lead on it to make sure that you feel like you're introduced properly.
Jake W: Yeah, I think kind of what you said first would make the most sense maybe inviting you to the next meeting because, you know, just hearing from a random vendor could be like, hey, I'm so busy, I don't know but I, you know, I guess just like my hope is just that we'll be involved when he's settled in just so that we can kind of show what we can do, you know, and put our best foot forward. So I think that's great. And yeah, we can kind of if you're good with that, you could just pass along this meeting. And then if there are opportunities that come up, you know, we're happy to join and, you know, we can bring other technical resources or whatever that is to support that meeting.
Spencer M: Sounds great. I'll send over his contact information anyway. So you have it and,
Jake W: yeah, that'd be great. And.
Spencer M: we'll do our job and work on our side and then loop you in for the next one.
Jake W: Yeah, that's perfect. And then really just like another thing and I think I sent over some information on it, but we do have our connections tour going on right now and I know like your organization, everybody's kind of spread out but we are hitting a lot of major cities. So if there's any interest there, you know, we'd love to have you out and it's a great kind of time to network see what's new, but then also just see how other companies are using Domo.
Spencer M: Right. I think when I looked there wasn't anything near me but I didn't check for anyone else, but we'll definitely kind of pass that on the information around and see if there's anyone that would be able to make use of it.
Jake W: Yeah, I think that's great. And really where with the adoption engine, you know, you should be able to utilize those resources. So there are things that could make things easier with workflows and other things. And I know that of course, you guys are all really technical, but if it's just even to take, you know, some of the workload off, you know, we can definitely get to use that as well because it's a new program and some of our, some of my other customers are utilizing it or trying to figure out like the best way to use it. But that's one of the things is, hey, maybe there's things like with workflows or some automation that you'd wanted to do. But just from like time allocation, you know, it hasn't been available that's something we can definitely help with.
Brian A: Yeah, definitely. As we go along, just keeping a loop. I know.

Michael D: Not too bad. Not too bad. How about you?
Hrithvik L: Yeah, not too bad. Yeah, same. Yeah. Just trying to, you know, get through like whole things. So just trying to understand what we have and what not?
Michael D: Yeah, it's a lot to kind of take in. I can imagine. I remember when I first started using Domo, it was, it felt like I was drinking from a fire hose at one point. So totally understand. But before we get started, how do you pronounce your name? And what do you like to be called? Because I just want to make sure I'm addressing you correctly?
Hrithvik L: Oh, yeah. So like my first name, it goes like it's hrithvik. You can split that in two. It's like the H is silent in that, but you can call me by my last name. That's why I have written in caps… lad. Yeah.
Michael D: Lad. Okay. Just want to make sure I was pronouncing it, right? That's.
Hrithvik L: easy to pronounce as well.
Michael D: Awesome. I appreciate that. All right. And you're based out of Texas as well?
Hrithvik L: Yeah. Awesome.
Michael D: So.
Hrithvik L: Like previously, like I came in Texas around April… and I was doing like a remote contract job at that time. So it was like back and forth Dallas and Seattle. So then I saw the job posting here, then I applied and then I like moved to Texas only then. Yeah.
Michael D: Oh, nice. Awesome. All right. I'm just pulling up Domo university. So give me a second here. And then I'll share my screen and we'll I'll kind of walk you through what, what's… available. I'm also trying to get, I wasn't sure if Wayne or William had provided what the, your education coupon discount code is. Did they give you that yet or no?
Hrithvik L: No, not yet. Okay?
Michael D: Cool. Let me pull that as well.
Hrithvik L: Yeah. Also, you are like recording the screen, right? So, after like our meeting gets over, can you send me so that I can take a look if I missed something or not? Yeah.
Michael D: Absolutely.
Hrithvik L: All right. You are. So you are based out of like Utah or?
Michael D: No, even though we're headquartered out of Utah, I'm… going to be able to introduce myself. I'm based out of, just outside of Cincinnati, Ohio. So, I've been working at Domo for almost four years now. And then prior to working at Domo, I was actually a Domo customer for a large healthcare insurance company, where I stood up Domo within their marketing department. So, I've been using Domo for a while, but I understand kind of like where Wayne and William and yourself are coming from of being customers and having to use it to stand up and support your end users. And from that standpoint, I think it gives me a little bit of an advantage just knowing the pain and struggle that I went through. I'm trying to help helping customers overcome that as well because I went through it myself. So, There's nothing in there's. Nothing in Domo that you can't learn, either from, Domo university or even through what is called our Domo central, which is where our community, our different members, engage in and participate in discussions as well. So, I'm going to walk through both of those, and of course, you still have me as a resource as well. Yeah. So if you do get stuck, if you don't have, you know, access, to Wayne or William, or they can't answer the question, please feel free to always reach out to me and let me know. And, you know, happy to hop on a quick call and do a screen share or if I can answer it, via email, I'll do my best as well.
Hrithvik L: Yeah.
Michael D: Awesome. All right. So, I'm going to share my screen. I do have your, your coupon code, put a couple things here in the chat. So, the first learndomo… Domo. Com. This URL is how you would access Domo university, and Domo university is, our main portal that, all of, our courses, all of our trainings are located. You do have to have, a user license to access Domo. And that's the same user license that you use to log into your Domo instance. It will typically, it'll typically ask you when you, pull up that URL of what your domain is, and that's just the dell tile, got it. And then it'll ask you to log on and that's just using, your normal login information. Okay? But once you log in, then you have access to this Domo university homepage, where it then gives you some options to access trainings, but it's broken up in a way to kind of identify, well, where are you today? And what is it that you're looking for? So, if you're new to Domo, there's some content specific to just beginners, right? Just starting to learn Domo, which we call our Domo fundamentals. And this could be really impactful too. I know, I think you said you've had a little bit of experience using Domo before, was that?
Hrithvik L: So it was just like, kind of some raw data but with like, very less data actually and it was just straightforward. So, just, import the data and, very less filters and just make the dashboard. So it was very straightforward. So it was like you can say a base level and, yeah.
Michael D: Okay.
Hrithvik L: That's why I told you that. I need to, consider myself like start from beginning, you know, so that because delta uses Domo heavily, right? So that's why?
Michael D: Exactly. Yeah. So, I would then recommend, let's go through the Domo fundamentals. It's a two part section, double one on one for new users and then consuming data. The first module takes a little over four hours. The second module only takes an hour. Okay. But that would give you a good base level understanding of what Domo is, how it's used, and what some of the core functionality, is for Domo. Okay. If… I go back to the homepage… it also allows you to search, training just by your role. So, within Domo, depending on what your responsibility is in the organization, you could be someone that's just a data consumer, right? You just look at dashboards, you're only kind of ingesting or consuming the information that maybe admins are putting out for you, right?

This is probably my second meeting that I've joined and the first one, I was not really actively listening, but our contract, is it done at the end of August or what is the status of our agreement?

So we don't actually do much with sales or renewals. We're just simply here to do, you know, like hands on help… let me find out, but I would assume that you guys are up for renewal. So yeah, the current contract probably ends and would… renew at the end of August is what I'm guessing or wait, I'm sorry, probably end of September.
Abraham M: So, I wanted to see if we can kind of push… the renewal a little bit more until we finally until I understand, I'll blame myself understand what the difference is between the credits and how we want to shift.

So basically what Eric wants, so Eric wants to know right where the contract stands. Julia gave me an update on, you know, that we're gonna be hearing back next week as to, you know, what we need to do to renew that agreement. What I wanna ask is since we're coming due on, oh, Eric is joining since we're coming due for the renewal at the end of the month, which is just a couple of weeks from now, if there's any way to pause the renewal until we fully understand the impact of the changes that you're suggesting we make to our Domo dashboards… and refresh rates.
Benjamin P: Yeah. So the contract is, so Justin is your account executive and it is his, he is your primary point of contact when it comes to contract and renewal discussions. And so I would definitely defer questions and details around that to him. However, what we're here for myself, Shane, Julia Ankit, is we have been assigned as consulting resources at no cost to you to help you maximize the value of your current Domo investment. And so we are providing free consulting resources to you to engage on any projects that you feel are important and are aligned with your business goals. And so those could be building dashboards with your data that's already in your instance, it could be building new connections inside of Domo. It could be building custom solutions or workflows or whatever it is. Now, I don't want to focus on the Domo tools because that's not what's important. What's important is focusing on what are your business goals? What are your challenges? Where are areas of the business where you would like to use technology resources to optimize costs or make things more efficient? And then we can discuss, okay, well, where does Domo fit into that overall architecture? And where can we help you achieve those business goals with the technology that you've already purchased? And so the formal name that we give for that process is a roadmap. We are working to create a roadmap for your organization where we can help visualize and communicate how Domo can fit into your current it architecture as well as understand what use cases we can tackle to address the issues or the problems or the challenges that you face based on the discussions that we've had. So that's what we've tried to do up until this point, we were instructed by Eric and Greg too to work on better understanding or having a dashboard to help better understand consumption and credits, and how that will look in the future. And so we've worked with Greg to build that out. We're waiting to get.
Eric S: Where are we with that? Has that been completed?
Benjamin P: Yes. And Greg, do you have any feedback on that?
Greg H: No, I was going back and forth with Abraham a little bit this morning, just saying like you guys wrapped up maybe two, three weeks ago, and then the last two weeks, you guys sort of showed me the ropes.

Kunal S: hello, Nick. Hello? Brian.
Brian F: Hello, everyone. What's… what are we doing today? Are we doing the skilled metric matrix thing?
Kunal S: We are going to discuss about the critical path logic that we have figured out, Brian for the manning project. And, yes, I mean, like we have some things to maybe like show and discuss with them.
Brian F: Okay. Do we show? I cannot remember now? Did we show them the skills matrix reporting? I don't think we, have we?
Nik K: You showed them? I mean, we talked about the questions and you showed them an initial version? I think.
Brian F: I didn't show them the updated version though?
Nik K: No, I don't think so.
Brian F: Okay. Yeah. Okay.
Fui K: I'll send a note right now. Just attaching the email thread of what we were going to follow up with on Monday from man. Why am I losing her name, the project manager from her email on Friday, Juliana's email. Yeah, and just see if they're still going to join or not.
William W: Arctic people.
Nik K: It's just us for now, love.
Fui K: The energy.
William W: Gotta do it. I can't help myself.
Fui K: Especially on a Monday, right?
William W: I know… my wife's like sweetie, calm down, please stop… the. The one thing that I wanted to ask real quick, just this group. Oh, no, I already figured it out, nevermind sorry.
Fui K: Coming in with the answers and the solutions before you act impressive, especially on a Monday, you know?
William W: Very effective, very effective. You have to be to keep up with this team dude. So, should… we just… like, pull this back and hop out?
Fui K: Yeah, just send an email to Ted and Tyson and then attach Juliana's email follow up from Friday about what we were going to review today?
William W: Cool.
Fui K: Yeah, I think once we get to 10 minutes, right? That's usually the marker?
William W: Fui, were you in the office last week or I guess the week prior, yep?
Fui K: Yep. There was a few days both last week and the week prior that I was working remote just with some local customer onsites. But yeah, majority of the time, I'm in the office. I,
William W: feel like I saw you, man. I was in town Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and I feel like I saw you like once or twice but.
Fui K: Next day, hey, next time, feel free, to tap me on the shoulder. Yeah, dude.
William W: What floor are you on?
Fui K: I'm on the fifth floor?
William W: Oh, with the cool guys up there, that's why I didn't see you too much.
Fui K: I don't know about the cool guys. The rowdy bunch… that's awesome. I had a few folks confused. I don't know if you worked with Lonnie or posse. They're two other pretty we're all pretty big polynesians and so funny because we've had a few folks when they come in from, you know, working remote or from out of town, they'll come into the office and they'll be like, hey posse. I'm like, oh, I'm fui… hey, Lonnie, I.
William W: Got in the elevator with one of you guys and I was worried that you guys are built like a brick house dude, or at least the one that I had gotten in that elevator with. I was like, dude, you guys are eating something. So are you, and I know we're probably going to hop here in a second in Washington. I hung out with a bunch of folks from guam quite a bit, and the guam food is so dang good. Is it similar to the hawaiian or polynesian food?
Fui K: Yeah, yeah. Very, there's a lot of overlap because they're technically a part of micronesia, okay? And then we're polynesia which they're neighboring areas in the south pacific, so there's a lot of overlap. So, good food that's why a lot of us are just overweight obese, and just huge.
William W: I would be too man, chicken adobo, I could eat that for days. I don't know if, you know what caliguin is. I don't it's like you take beef when you're barbecuing, it's an appetizer and you take beef and you put it in a bowl with lemon juice and like a bunch of other different things. And the lemon juice essentially like cooks the beef while it's sitting there. And then you just snack on it while you're barbecuing it's fantastic. I'll send you a recipe dude. It's so good.
Fui K: That sounds great. What's up, Ted?
Ted S: Hey, I joined at a good time. Sounds tasty.
William W: You're talking about pacific islander food, which is incredible if you haven't tried it.
Ted S: That sounds good. Yeah, only a little bit, so.
William W: Amazing, man. Well, I'll hand it over to someone that is less culinary driven to kick.
Fui K: the meeting off.
William W: Nick or Ted or whoever. What did you have in mind for the meeting today?
Nik K: One of the main things, I mean, I guess we had two main things to review. One was an update to the skills matrix, and then the other was just the data work for phase two of the manning app and tracking down the critical path. So we can start with that data work. I think we just wanted to show you where it's at and go through just making sure we were pulling the right numbers compared to your system… and talk a little bit about next steps. How do we want to consume this and how do you envision the end user using this in the app? Does that sound good Ted?
Ted S: Yeah, I know Tyson's probably going to need to give some more specifics on what his vision is for presenting it, but I might be able to help at least make sure you've got the right information in front of you. So, and I think he's probably, I think he's currently tied up, so.
Nik K: Okay. Let's do the first part. Yeah. Let's make sure we got the right numbers in and then we'll talk about that, Brian. You came on mute?
Brian F: Yeah. And I actually have another question while I'm at it, this popped up and I swear, I've not been on here that long… so I.
Nik K: don't.
Brian F: know if you guys have set the time out to like 10 minutes or?
Ted S: I don't think I did intentionally. I think I backed it off on the mobile. In fact. So unless I got tweaked inadvertently, I don't think I intentionally made it really.
Brian F: Short that thing. Will that thing will?

Katie F: What's that?
Juliana J: Oh, go ahead. I think you're about to answer my question. Yeah, I should be home in like five, 10 minutes. Okay. Yeah, I think we can start with the boats group connection discussion and then we can move over to completing the roadmap and then talking about next steps on the sales use case. Hey, Katie.
Katie F: Hey, good afternoon, guys. How are you?
Juliana J: Doing well. How are you?
Katie F: Good. Just going to shoot Rachel a text here and make sure she's hopping on because we need the harvest updates.
Juliana J: Yeah. Okay. Yeah, sounds good. We're waiting on Nick too. So we'll need him for that discussion as well. Hey, Rachel.
Rachel P: Hey,
Juliana J: hey,
Rachel P: how are you guys doing?
Juliana J: Doing well. How are you?
Rachel P: Good.
Juliana J: All right. Nick is on his way. Oh, here he is. Speak of the devil. So, today, we wanted to talk about both group connection and any connection items in general. And then we wanted to go over your business goals on your roadmap and just get that wrapped up. And then we wanted to talk about next steps on the sales use case that we talked about the last time and just see what that looks like. And then I do want to save 10 minutes at the end for John. I know he's going to be on site with you guys next week. So we want to make sure that you guys have some time to go over that agenda. I know that's a lot to cover but hopefully we can fit it all in and if not, we can punt something to next week.
Rachel P: Okay. Sounds good.
Juliana J: Okay. So if we want to start with the data connections, I think that'll be a good place to start. Brian's actually on his way home from an appointment. So it'll be good if we start with Nick items, and then we can move on to the other items. So, I know there is some back and forth about getting the email connector set up with boat's group last week. So maybe that's a good spot to start.
Nik K: Yeah. What was the response like from boat's group? Were they able to take that email address and set something up?
Rachel P: Katie, are you still on? I know she had a phone call she had to take.
Nik K: Okay. So.
Juliana J: We.
Rachel P: could probably come back to that if she's not answering?
Nik K: Okay. I.
Rachel P: don't know the update on that. I know that she was working through it though.
Nik K: Okay. Yeah. I think we just want to see if boat's group was a, okay with, you know, setting that up and I was especially skeptical because, you know, it says something Domo. Com and they would know you're using this data where they don't want it used. I guess. So if they're okay with that and they've set that up, that's fine. Then the other factor in there was, well, what columns did they actually end up sending? Right? If there's still pieces that are remaining manual, then do we want to go down that more advanced approach of just directly tapping into the process you do manually and just automating that where you log in, Qlik the button to download and it will do that. So, I guess.
Rachel P: Yeah, I really wouldn't know. I don't think she's okay. She probably already stepped out since she's not answering. So. Okay.
Nik K: Okay. So I'll save that one. I guess really on the data front. That was all I did check and lean since nothing has come in so we can put a pin in that for now Juliana.
Juliana J: Yeah. Was there another data connection, Rachel that you wanted to talk about? I know Katie mentioned that there was an item.
Rachel P: Yeah, that had to do with the listings object and our lead count, but that's not on quite yet. He's finishing up the last bit of it now because I was out at the Hubspot conference last week, so I wasn't able to get him the last piece that he needed until early this week.
Juliana J: Okay. No problem. So still holding pattern.
Rachel P: On that one?
Juliana J: Okay. We'll put a pin in that then too. No worries. All right. Cool. So we can move on then to just talking about your business goals. I had sent over the slide… I think. And I know you guys are super busy. So no worries. If you haven't gotten a chance to look into it at all, these are just like goals that we've either maybe talked through a little bit or things that have kind of come from your website, things like that. And then I just put this here as an idea or placeholder but we just want to just talk like overall business goals with you guys to make sure that we're aligned with our use cases and make sure that we're prioritizing things in the appropriate order. So, yeah, just any thoughts you had around this Rachel?
Rachel P: I would say it's tough because the call tracking and Avaya stuff goes into the existing marketing dashboard, but the sales performance would just be so helpful. It's hard to say what would make more sense. It… would make more sense to try and connect the call data just so that at least our marketing dashboard is fully done… and obviously finishing the boats group. And this leads connector as well. Then moving on to the sales dashboard. I would say difficulty with intelligence and buy, which is running slow. We'll have to work through that. Sure.
Juliana J: As far as the use cases, you feel like this is probably still the right order. So automating the polls to get that all into the marketing dashboard, and then the lead management stuff, getting that also added into the marketing. And then working on the sales performance stuff. Is that correct? Yes. Okay. All right. Cool. And then I guess, so this is as far as business goals go, this is more of sales performance. This is marketing stuff. And then this is also fits into marketing. Is there anything else? That you feel like is key that we want to add to your business goals? Or do you feel like this pretty much wraps it up? Sums it up? Is there anything from like any other departments? I feel like.
Rachel P: that, I feel like that?
Katie F: Rachel, you broke up?
Rachel P: Sums it up for now, Katie, you're back. They had a.
Katie F: Question for you. Yeah, sorry, guys. I had to step out for a call. Rachel texted me as far as the update from boats group.

Ankit S: There's some Halloween things kicking off here in Delaware. Oh, yeah, yeah.
Brian W: Nice.
Ankit S: And I love Halloween. So, there's like apparently like… a top five in the country, sort of like haunted hayride and like haunted house stuff in my town.

Brian W: Yeah, you got a costume ready?
Ankit S: No, I haven't figured that out yet. I mean, I definitely want to dress up for Halloween. I always like want to do something easy… like I've done, Bob from Bob's burgers.
Brian W: Oh, yeah. That's a good one. Yeah.
Ankit S: So, just like a mustache and an apron and like a gray shirt… I might do beaker from the muppets this year as well.
Brian W: Oh, that's cool.
Ankit S: Yeah, he's the one with like a lab coat and like the orange nose.
Brian W: Oh, yeah. I see him.
Ankit S: Or like an orange hair. Yeah… yeah, I might do that.
Brian W: Cool. Yeah, I don't got any plans on what costumes? I'm I keep it kind of like you low effort.
Ankit S: Yeah.
Brian W: I don't want to say low effort, but like, maybe I'm not that creative. So, like coming up with like some elaborate costume is just not my thing. I remember going to like one party and someone was dressed up as like a shower, literally like a shower, like he had like a metal contraption that went up his back and like the shower curtain, he had like flowing water. It was actually really cool.
Ankit S: Wow… that's like Ralph macchio in karate kid. Yeah.
Brian W: Yeah, something like that. Yeah, maybe that's where the inspiration came from.
Ankit S: Yeah, that's dedication.
Aishwarya D: Yeah.
Ankit S: Well, yeah, we can jump right in.
Brian W: Yeah, Eric is traveling, so he won't be here, but I got a few notes on the app that I think we can work through still getting through it in more detail, but we can at least address these questions and we have shared this with our GBPS of finance. So they're more kind of like the field finance leaders who run their, you know, individual groups with all the opcos below them. They've been taking a look at it as well and providing some feedback. So that's good.
Aishwarya D: Amazing.
Brian W: Yeah. Let's just maybe jump into some of these questions here.
Ankit S: And while you're pulling that up, just a quick update, I got an approval for eight additional hours.
Brian W: Nice.
Ankit S: So we're at six hours right now. So, plus the eight. So we're looking at about 14 hours remaining.
Brian W: Cool. I know we've made a lot of progress on this past maybe two, three weeks. So, thank you. All right. Pulling my notes here. So on the monthly PL bridges… yes. Oh, maybe this was, were there changes in the past hour?
Aishwarya D: Oh, not past hour, but today, whatever.
Brian W: We.
Aishwarya D: discussed on Wednesday.
Brian W: Okay.
Aishwarya D: If you want me to walk you through the changes first, I can do that or if you want to just go along?
Brian W: I only have like four things that I want to check with you, but it looks like it's already corrected. So what I saw here previously was gross profit dollars was doubled up for a 20 25, but it looks like that's fixed. Now, this used to say like 60,000,000.
Aishwarya D: Oh, okay.
Brian W: Maybe I had a filter wrong on here. It's possible. And then this, the operating profit was also doubled up, but interestingly enough revenue was good. So that's actually that covers it.
Aishwarya D: Yeah. And while we're on bridges now, if you'll see everything is in millions?
Brian W: Yep. Thank you.
Aishwarya D: Instead of having all three in one row, which was overlapping with the labels, I thought of splitting the one on the second row, we can extend the height of this card but I think it's looking, it's giving you everything that you need. I feel in this fashion.
Brian W: Yeah, I agree. And if we want to maybe even put in another card here in the future, we can just make this one the same size as these. And hey, we have a nice two by two.
Aishwarya D: Yeah. And you still get the entire figure when you hover, so.
Brian W: Yeah, yeah. Yeah. So thank you for making that. The next one was on project service mix. Maybe this has already been updated too, but I noticed and I'm going to do the math here really quick. I noticed the gross margins for the individual classes, you know, maintenance service project and other was just slightly off and it could be just due to rounding here. But let's look at service for service maintenance for June margin that I'm calculating here. There's 44 point six here. We're showing 43 point six. Maybe I'm not doing that, right? Two point five divided by five point six. Yeah, 44 point six. So like ever so slightly off.
Aishwarya D: Well, you're, you're dividing by the abbreviated?
Brian W: Views. Oh, hold on. Maybe maybe I just got these labels mixed up. No, wait. Yeah. So I'm taking two point 5,000,000 gross profit for service maintenance divided by five point six, and I'm getting 44 point six.
Aishwarya D: Correct. But can we just to be sure, can we open this card and divide it with the whole number that we see if you can open it in analyzer?
Brian W: Sorry. Is this right?
Aishwarya D: No… go to the ellipses? I mean, that was right. But sorry, you had to go to the ellipse, you can expand it and, yeah, yes. And then under the first one mtd amount, yeah, you can Qlik on it and format it, Qlik on format. Okay, disable abbreviation… just so we can get the whole number. We can try dividing this.
Brian W: Oh, yeah. Yeah. I see what you're saying. Okay, good. Call two. That's probably it.
Aishwarya D: Let me get my calculator in a second.
Brian W: Yeah. There you go. Now, it's just rounding. So my fault.

Calvin M: No, I think we're working on some data issues before we, but we're scrutiny. Yeah, nothing portal related. It's just more, you know, how we're, some of the drawings we're doing, we've got this concept called, Rosetta stone, which kind of maps our groups and our ids and we're you know, sonny's actually working on revamping that. And so, that's going to be your strategy, what we see in Domo?
Dan H: Nice.
Sonja D: Hey, guys.
Calvin M: Hey, sonny.
Dan H: Oh, well, hopefully, you can, get some traction there.
Sonja D: Does our leaf health meeting notes have a background that's kind of funny?
Dan H: Yeah, I saw it too. I was like, whoa, what is this?
Sonja D: We got some AI with some taste or something.
Dan H: Yeah, view the zoom chat for more info.
Calvin M: Yeah, I think this is the first time I've seen that on zoom. Yeah.
Sonja D: Me too. Interesting.
Dan H: All right. Have you enjoyed that read AI?
Sonja D: So far? So good. We, finally, I finally implemented it for everybody on Friday of last week. Nice. So still kind of getting used to it. Yeah, but yeah, it's good. We did choose it just because it does have hipaa compliance and it was less expensive than some of the other options too. So, you know, it feels like everything kind of has the same features if you will. But anyway.
Dan H: Right on.
Sonja D: All right. Well, so, just to give you an update, I still have not gotten resolution to the ticket and I still can't promote our dashboard to production as a result.
Dan H: Of that. So, this was the one where the controls were getting messed up.
Sonja D: Yeah, the controls got messed up now. I mean, that I haven't had an issue with at all, but I can't promote it to production. It basically errors out on me.
Dan H: And does it say what the error is?
Sonja D: Yeah, I've sent that, to the, whatever.
Dan H: You put that on the ticket?
Sonja D: Yeah.
Dan H: All right. Let me open that up and I'll see if I can't apply a little pressure on my end. Let's see. I don't deal with our support stuff very often, but let's see… please help me sign the ticket… here. This is the donor customer, perfect cases. Sign you these controls issue. Let's open this. It looks like… on 825. So, what this was? It may take a little more time to make sure everything is handled thoroughly. Please, rest assured. I don't know how to read this. Basically.
Sonja D: They're working on it?
Dan H: Yeah, or they're waiting for… this is the dumbest view. It's like it's truncated. I can't see the whole comment.
Sonja D: I'm going to share my screen. I can show you.
Dan H: Yeah.
Sonja D: Yeah… I've got it open.
Dan H: Thank you. I'm pretty sure we're actually addressing that. Thanks for your patience. Well, I will. I actually don't even know if I know how to, well… new comments.
Sonja D: Here's, the error messages. These are in two separate rows… but this date year month is one of the controls. I believe anyway.
Dan H: Well, let me, so… this… let's do this… copy and working one of our leaders… in support. Any chance you can help me get it? I just shot a note over to. Cody is Samir's… boss… And we'll see what I can… make happen here.
Sonja D: Okay.
Dan H: Oh, it looks like they do have a Jira ticket. So, basically, what happens when… you know, when you open a case in Salesforce, our engineering team works at a Jira. So, once they get the case, basically, once they vet the case and confirm that there's an issue, then they load it in Jira, where engineering works, it looks like they have… done… that. They've got it. Yeah, there's an app studio thing. I think it may end up being a sandbox thing, but it looks like they're doing the right things to get the right people working on it.
Sonja D: Okay.
Dan H: Gotcha. Weird. I'm sorry, I wish I could help more there.
Sonja D: No, that's all right. Looks.
Dan H: Like I could escalate it maybe, but let's just see, what Cody can do for us.
Sonja D: Yeah, just see what they have. Yep. Yeah. So we're just really in a holding pattern right now. As Calvin mentioned, we're finalizing some data governance which is going to get me away from the whole group level data governance and onto the pricing master stuff, which is going to get us moving forward on a couple other things. Just had to have a lot of patience right now in this company because governance is the foundation for everything that we need to do so, but.
Dan H: Yeah. All right. Well, I, what, once we, what's on deck? Once we get this out in front of the customers,
Sonja D: so we've got, we probably are going to have a couple of, key demonstrations and we have a couple of strategic client opportunities that would be beyond just like our client facing capability. So there's you know, different tiers of service if you will. And I think there's some clients that might have some, interest in that, in that, and then, and then, you know, obviously, it's going to be rolling it out to the rest of the, rest of the group, but, yeah, the governance is going to be important to get that data validation before we roll it completely out. But, yeah. So, I think, by fourth quarter, we should have a rollout, timeline at least if not already being rolled out.
Dan H: Okay. Cool. All right. Well, I, Cody… mentioned that they made it a high priority case earlier, which should help it move pretty quickly and ask for more details on what's being blocked and what the urgency is, and see if, he can escalate it.
Sonja D: So, yeah, I think it's just, it's the, for us, it would be if we did have this to out to all of our customers, it would be a bigger issue just because, well, I mean, honestly, I think the functionality is working okay because it hasn't been promoted. So, the old version's working just fine.

Ford H: Hey, Kevin. Good afternoon.
Kevin W: Good afternoon. How you doing? I'm fine. How you been?
Ford H: Doing good. I actually… been having some laptop issues so they got me a new one today. So we'll see how this one goes. We did a windows 11 upgrade on a lot of our PCS and it messed up teams badly.
Kevin W: That's no good.
Ford H: Yeah. And evidently, they've known about it for like over a month and they haven't been able to figure out how to fix it. So, it is… what it is, you know?
Kevin W: Yeah. Well, I'm on a mac, so I haven't been on a windows machine in like 20 years.
Ford H: Yeah. I'm wishing I was on a mac right about now. So I got a new teams. Let me see. Yeah. Okay. I'm in business. Hi, Julia.
Julia C: Hey, Heather. How's it going? Good? How are you? Great. It's great to meet you.
Ford H: Yeah, nice to meet you all.
Kevin W: So, Heather, I'm bringing.
Julia C: in.
Kevin W: Some reinforcements.
Ford H: Yeah.
Kevin W: Christine, Julia, Christine's been on actually some of the earlier calls and Julia, they're… both on our professional service team and Julia… was working pretty closely on some of the earlier deliverables for ses and then kind of moved on to some other things. But now that we're getting into the throes of looking at sample data, getting ready to connect the data. And this thing's starting to really get some teeth. I felt like it was time for us to bring in some project management because Braxton's busy and Jace is busy and keeping everyone aligned and making sure questions are getting answered and meetings are getting scheduled and we're moving through this as quick as possible given the delays we had in getting connected to the data, I really want to start to produce some things that we can start sending up the chain and get people excited about.
Ford H: Yeah. Well, and I have a bit of good news for you all on Monday. It's going before the committee and we should get our sar approval officially on Monday, which means we'll be able to open up the floodgates with actual data. So, yeah.
Kevin W: Yeah, I know. And we've been bantering about the sample data and the word document associated with it. And we actually talked to Christelle yesterday… the day before and we've already seen several gaps.
Ford H: Okay, good.
Kevin W: Yeah. So we know that there's some gaps and so we're hoping we get connected to the actual data that will start to fill in some of those gaps, but it's been helpful because, you know, now everyone's kind of all right. This thing's getting real. We've got to start really figuring out what we're going to do with it.
Ford H: Finally, right?
Kevin W: Yeah, yeah, no, it's exciting. It's great. And I think it's going to be really cool. But, you know, yeah, I don't want to get off the rails before we even get started. So our CS leader pulled in, Julie, normally, Steve would be working with us, Steve nielsen, but he had a, I think his mother passed away. So, Steve's been running the PM for the other ups project we have running with SCS, working with Jill Odell and people, you know, in Louisville Shelly. But so he hasn't been available. So, Julie's jumping in so he may come back in, but for now we're going to work with Julie and Christine is our lead from professional services, anything and everything related to finance. So, has a finance background.
Ford H: Oh, we'll get along. Great, Christine, yes.
Kristine F: Absolutely.
Ford H: So,
Kevin W: I'm going to turn it over to you all. I've said enough.
Julia C: Awesome. I have a few, oh, go ahead Heather.
Ford H: Well, I was just going to say before we jump in, I wanted to mention Kevin, I don't know, I don't with my laptop being out of my hands for quite a few hours today, I wasn't sure if maybe you had already forwarded the invite we have for, you know, the collective group next. I think it's next Thursday.
Kevin W: Yeah, yeah.
Ford H: Have you already shared that invite with them?
Kevin W: Yeah, everyone else? Yeah, everyone on this call has been shared that invite, correct Christine and Julie, you guys have that, Julie, you might not. I know Christine does.
Kristine F: Yeah. On Thursday, I'll get that forwarded.
Ford H: Okay. Sorry, Julie. What were you gonna say?
Julia C: Yeah, no, I was just gonna say I've got a couple of quick slides to run through. So, Kevin kind of already introduced me. I'm one of our leaders here in professional services. So I run one of our consulting teams. But with Steve being out, we didn't want the ball to drop on this. We know how important it is especially now that we have some movement available here. And Christine, like you said, you can't get better when it comes to finance than Christine. We've brought her in here. Since I am newer. Let's see if it's going to let me share. Sometimes I have issues with teams, okay? Since I am newer here to this engagement. Heather the team has filled me in, but I do apologize if you have to repeat some information. I'm just trying to make sure that we're moving the ball in the direction that we can get the fastest mobility here. Oh, I'm actually sharing the wrong slide deck.
Kevin W: That's it. It's in April 20 24.
Julia C: Yeah. This is Ed's. I don't have all of the permissions on teams, so it doesn't usually let me share what I need to share. So I think that one had all the.
Kristine F: slides if you want to just go down before you share.
Julia C: Oh, it doesn't have my slides in there.
Kristine F: Oh, okay. Sorry.
Julia C: No, it's okay. Really, what I was going to do is I was going to show you your team because I know this gets confusing as we continue to expand and add on Kevin Braxton, and Jace, who you're quite familiar with. They're really going to be your account team. So they're long term, they're not going anywhere. You can bug them forever as long as it makes you happy. We are bringing in myself, Steve. When he gets back, Scott and Christine, we're going to be on the implementation side. So we'll be with you here more to do the solution and the subject matter expertise.

They also explored options to reduce credit usage, such as moving data processing to Redshift or Snowflake, and agreed to finalize the contract changes by the end of the month.","Makida W: hi, Signe. I,
Signe P: have two mackies.
Makida W: Oh, hold on. Huh. Okay. Is it better now? Just one Mackie?
Signe P: I still see two but I'm fine. I can hear you. So we're good.
Makida W: I think, I know what happened. I joined on the web and also on the app, oh.
Signe P: Got it. That's funny. Yeah.
Makida W: How are you? How you been?
Signe P: How was your day off?
Makida W: It was good. It was good and yours, how was your weekend?
Signe P: It was really good. I was in Washington on a little lake house, so it was really nice. Wow. Yeah, luckily, it's pretty close. It's like two hours away. So it was really fun.
Makida W: Nice.
Signe P: Yeah. What'd you do for your time off?
Makida W: I didn't do anything. I just have lots of family here, so.
Signe P: Oh, fun.
Makida W: Yeah, it was fun. Yeah. Okay. And I don't know if I think keske might be tied up or not, but, we can start and then he can join in when he can. Okay. So basically, so my understanding is that we need to be able to give you. Okay, we're going to use this much credits going forward. And then this is what we're going to go with and we won't get the invoice for the overusage that happened this year. Yep. So two things that keske mentioned to me was one, we haven't moved the stuff yet. So, what that means is that, you know, the credit users that matt went through with us… right? All the stuff that was just being refreshed continuously. It needs to be moved. We know we want to move it for sure that's going to happen, but it's not going to be anytime soon because of the big project that we have now. So that's one concern. And then the second one is with the new project, right? They're developing something we're at the POC stage with the Domo app studio. Remember the hakoda team? Yeah, they're working on it. So they have a process like using java and all that on the app studio side. So we don't know how much credits that's going to cost us?
Signe P: And on the POC, we included credits.
Makida W: Oh, okay. But in the future, is there a way to estimate the usage or is it going to be using the same credit estimator?
Signe P: It would be using the same credit estimator.
Makida W: Okay. In that case, I'll just share that with them. But what would be the best way to go forward then? Because given that we want to move, we know we want to move the credit refresh cost and also, we're not sure how much it's going to cost us in the future with app studio.
Signe P: Yeah. So my recommendation and it's completely up to you. So as of right now, there's about it's just over 4,000 credits in overage. So, what I recommend is based on, I think the numbers that I gave you by October, it's going to be 37,000 credits. That would be over what your current, you had 40,000 credits. So I feel like it's going to kind of weigh or, you know, you're going to take some out but, you know, you're also going to be using some. I don't know how much you feel like you're going to change out like with the refresh of every 15 minutes, but we do know that you're going to be adding more. There's a few things that we can do with.
Makida W: What do you mean by adding more?
Signe P: So, for like the app studio or even new projects, you know, that it's not like you're going to pause everything right now and nothing else is going to happen between now and the end of October, right?
Makida W: Right.
Signe P: So, we know that there's going to be some new credits being used, but you are going to try to slow some things down. What I can say is it doesn't seem far off that you would use the projected amount of, I think it was like I can check the number. The updated number of it was like 37 or 38,000 credits.
Makida W: Yeah.
Signe P: When I talked about when you get to that 100 K mark, we can turn all of that into credits. So you'd have 100,000 credits for 100,000 dollars. Something else that I can do for you is let me see something if you are open to. I think I talked about like extending a year. We can add some additional perks. It's basically restructuring the agreement so I can give you enterprise caps and remind me if we talked about this but it gives you a better cap on the run rate, so that maybe there's things that you don't want to slow down that would help another it's called an enterprise cap schedule. So that could give you. So instead of, I think the standard right now is, you know, if you're running something 20 times, it's capped at 10. We only charge you for 10. But on the enterprise one, if you run something 20 times, you only get charged for five and don't quote me on, I can't remember the exact numbers but that's kind of the idea. So once you hit that 100 K mark, maybe there's things that you don't need to slow down. You'll have the capacity that you need for the additional growth and you won't have the overages.
Makida W: Okay. So with the new project that's going on, it's most likely that we won't be able to move anything in the next month by October, at least by this month. So what does that happen to us? I mean. If you're.
Signe P: not moving anything, then it's just going to keep doing the additional credits. So again, by the end of the month, if we had, if we say that we moved forward with like the 30,000 additional credits, then you would have those plus the ability to have a better the caps in place. So you're not going to be using as many credits and you should have capacity. But if you just keep going as is what they would do or like if we didn't decide how many credits moving forward, then you would have these, the overdone invoices which they're a one time fee. So they don't add on to your contract. And that's what we're trying to prevent because I want you to be able to utilize these credits going forward and not just have a one time fee.
Makida W: So every month we would have those one time fees for every overage.
Signe P: Yep. And so what we're trying to do is make it so it's added to your contract and that you can use those as you need so that they don't just, it's not just a charge for additional credit or for the overage credits.
Makida W: Okay.

Brian W: Hey, good afternoon. Good afternoon. Eric is still out. Don't know who can join? He might, he might join when we ping him. Oh, there he is. It's just about to message him, hey boo.
Vu N: Awesome. All righty.
Ankit S: Yeah, we could just jump right in. Aishwarya. Had a couple things in motion from last week, but Brian, was there anything you wanted to get started on first?
Brian W: Yeah, I got two specific questions, but we can go over Aishwarya's first.
Aishwarya D: Cool. You know, we just had a couple of feedback items which are done. One was to remove the company filter from the netwhip table card, which we did on the call, Brian, just so the numbers tie across the dashboard. And the other was to add gross margin under the budget cards which is done.
Brian W: Oh, great. Oh, yeah, I see those updates, thank you.
Aishwarya D: No problem.
Brian W: All right. I can hop into my two specific questions… unless maybe Vu you have anything to share.
Vu N: The… only thing I have to share is probably… has to do with our intact connector right now. Some of the data that we're pulling is just timing out because of the intact API connector. It has limitations on concurrent data pools. So it has nothing to do with the actual data itself. It's just we're starting to hit the limitations of the apis. So, I'm just engaging intact on a different solution which is meant to handle large data. I think I typed this to you last week. It's meant to handle large data pools. The data… still seems like it needs some correction. There's no easy way to refresh it instantly. So there might be a little bit of a delay.
Brian W: Yeah, that definitely comes into play. When we switch over to intact data within another month or so or even less than a month. Okay? All right. The two specific ones I have, so I rolled this or I just changed the date on the powerpoint. Let me actually share to August just to see how it looks compared to our August reporting… and two things that I see are missing are the new companies, Lowe and Griffin. We technically had them included in our excel consolidation. I don't know if there's a filter on the data set or these individual cards for excluding those two companies. But as we continue to acquire new companies, just having that be dynamically updated is something that we would need.
Aishwarya D: Yeah, we don't have a filter currently, that would exclude any.
Vu N: Company? Okay. Yeah, that's a web… user access. So they just need to add those companies to the Domo web user. And actually, I just, I messaged Emily about it this morning. She just added them.
Brian W: Oh, okay.
Vu N: Yeah. So I, it's like a, I would treat it as like a different account. If, if the entities aren't added to that account, then it won't be pulled over into the data. So.
Brian W: Wait. So, sorry, does that have to be changed on the ETL itself?
Vu N: No. Oh, okay.
Brian W: So, sorry, I may have been getting confused. I think this data set is still the excel data set. How does that impact this if it's not pulling from intact?
Vu N: Today would be intact… or would it be? Sorry? Yeah, you're right? Excel?
Brian W: Yeah. I'm still only looking at excel data right now because I think I am.
Aishwarya D: Yeah, it is excel.
Vu N: The company mapping them, I don't know. Let's see. It's this data table. Thank you. They're not on there. They went up here. So just need to add it. Good places. I need to add it. So, I will add it.
Brian W: I guess for these, any new companies that we have next year? Do you think this is just like a good practice going forward to make sure? Hey, maybe we should, I don't know, exclude those new companies from like the get go. And then, hey, if we need to add it in just like change that filter one off… no, the reason I say this is like if we're going to be switching over to intacct. I know there's going to be issues with the new companies and their historical books. Like we already see that with Lowe. And if we, you know, come forward in three weeks or a month and we switch over to intacct data, new companies, their historical books are going to be screwed up for a little while. Maybe I'm a little pessimistic there, but like, I doubt everything's going to be done immediately.
Vu N: Yeah… they would need to be added to two places in order to roll in so we can keep it the way it is as a control like ultimately.
Brian W: In.
Vu N: that company map if they're not added in there, they won't roll in.
Brian W: Okay. So, I think it covers us for new companies, not in a couple weeks streets before the end of the year.
Vu N: Yeah.
Brian W: Okay.
Vu N: No.
Brian W: Yeah, I'm good with that because I think even with low, they got to do a lot of stuff with their Canadian conversion. I don't think their sage data is going to be right in a couple weeks.
Vu N: That's true.
Brian W: They should… be doing things in local currency and the translation happens in sage. Got it. Because what I don't want to have happen here is we switch over to intact data and we know low's historical books are messed up for whatever reason including currency issues. I don't want this consolidated dashboard to be thrown off. If we can exclude… low for the time being, then let's do it.

Brian W: Difficult. Oh, okay. Cool. Yeah. All right. The next specific one I have is on the netwhip… table. Sorry, I changed the date. Yeah. Here to August. I don't it doesn't look like in this card here, the month over month for the month in question versus, you know, the beginning of the year is pulling over correctly… like the beginning of the year, I think is right? Because it's taking the ending… balance as of the end of December minus the latest month. So it was six point three looks close, but the month over month for sure, I don't think is working… because this would be August versus July.

Alex D: Man, I… love surprises that's all I have to say… that's how my day's going.
Ankit S: Hopefully your dogs didn't need some company over there though, right?
Alex D: Yeah. Well, I don't know if you caught it. But just before, like actually, just before that last phone call, he stepped on a wasp and he was like limping and so I went to go see why he's limping. I grabbed his paw and I grabbed the wasp and I'm like holy crap. So he got stung. So I've been icing his paw. I had to give him benadryl. So he's two days in a row. He's just been having some rough luck, man. Good lord.
Ankit S: How old is he?
Alex D: He is four, but he acts like he's six months old. He has got just an absolute insane amount of energy if we don't walk him every day and play with him all the time. He just, he starts doing a bunch of bad stuff.
Ankit S: Yeah, that sounds about right. Yep. Oh, hopefully he feels better.
Alex D: Yep. He seems like he's calmed down originally. I think he was just freaked out because he didn't know what was going on. He's like why is my paw hurt? And so he was kind of like pacing, but then limping because it hurt. And now he's calmed down. So he's in a better state.
Ankit S: Okay. So we might need to just make this a 30 minute call because you and me have to go to the jets call.
Alex D: Yeah, that's what Sharon and Jenna and I were talking about prior to that. So we're gonna have to squeeze this down into 30 minutes and hop over to jets.
Ankit S: Yeah, I think that's probably best. I'm just gonna follow up with them in the thread and just see where they're at.
Alex D: Good call.
Ankit S: Hello, matt. How are you? Good. How are you guys doing?
Alex D: Hey, matt. How's it going?
Ankit S: Good man. How you doing, Alex?
Alex D: Doing well, doing well, man. Thank you for asking.
Ankit S: Good… matt. First time we're meeting pleasure to connect with you. I'm taking over for Ivan. Okay? And yeah, just excited to be a part of the team and part of this adoption program. And yeah… it's been really rewarding. So, looking forward to getting started. Okay. Good. Yeah. The one Guy that should be at this meeting is Michael. Did he accept the invite?
Alex D: I'm here. Oh, Mike. Sorry, I didn't see you, buddy. Sorry. Yeah.
Ankit S: Just kept crashing over and over again. Sorry.
Alex D: I see only the four names that are on my zoom.
Ankit S: Meeting here and so I didn't see you there, but that's great.
Alex D: Okay. And matt, also, we have brought another Domo person in to support you guys. So I'd like Lindsey to have an opportunity to introduce herself.
Lindsay G: Thanks Alex. Hi, matt. I'm Lindsey, I'm your ace agent, so advanced customer enablement, we focus on educating you guys in the platform, really focus on working sessions, getting you acquainted with the core product features as well as updated on product releases. So I show you guys the new features, walk you through how to use them so that you guys really maximize your investment in Domo. Okay. That's great with the package that you guys have. You have about 45 hours with us a quarter. So I would love to get some weekly sessions, but I can follow up with my calendly link afterwards, but that's… great. I'm excited to get started with you guys.
Alex D: Yeah, that's matt. The big reason that we thought Lindsay would be great to bring into this was because we had a working session. I think it was last week and where we built out a data flow and I think that the team took really well to that and I feel like chronoside, you guys learned a lot and I could get a feel for it. We understand that you guys are technical. So when watching through the data flow and how it's built, there was a lot of learning that happened. And so I think Lindsay can support on, you know, keeping that momentum going and getting engagement with the platform. So.
Mat W: Yeah. And I think Alex just some quick feedback like I wasn't able to be part of that card billing session, but I had a follow up like discussion with both John and apu and both of them, you know, echoed the same thing that they enjoyed the session, you know, learned and appreciated how to, you know, how like tables were being connected and kind of got it. And so, you know, we've now set up some, you know, call it internal meetings where we're going to have like one weekly, you know, session every Monday to kind of like again talk about data connections, talk about card building, like what they're able to do, you know, on their own, you know, Lindsay maybe what I'd ask is let us maybe do a week, you know, or two of those internal sessions, see what the team is able to do, you know, without assistance. And then if they run into roadblocks, maybe we set up a separate session with you and you, Alex, maybe, you know, where they say, okay, listen, we tried to do this, you know, thought we could do it, you know, or having difficulty here. Can you help us? Right? And then they mentioned that they were like listen when you guys got into kind of building the curve. But then when it got to like the visualization and the various options on visualization, you guys kind of ran out of time. And so, you know, I think that's the one area where they still have some, you know, questions, you know, on what kind of visualization options there are and what's the best thing to do and use. And so, you know, I think they're eager and they like it and I think they'll get comfortable with it quickly, but they just, you know, need to know what are all the capabilities that it can do?
Alex D: And Domo is a pretty expansive platform. It can be a little bit overwhelming. So like the session that we had, I think that that's another reason why it resonated. And I'm glad that they're echoing the same sentiment that we had from our side because we thought it was a very valuable meeting for you guys as well. So that's really awesome. And I love your approach internalize, learn, build your knowledge, work together. And then if you get stuck, we're here to help. So that's awesome love that.

Eric S: Hey, good morning, you got me.
Benjamin P: Yep. How you doing?
Eric S: Pretty good there's, Greg. Hey, Greg.
Benjamin P: I believe this may be everybody for today. I don't know if Justin will be joining. I know Ankit is at a doctor's appointment, so I know he won't be joining. So we may have everyone. Okay. Got big weekend plans.
Eric S: Not really. I'm just going to take it easy. Enjoy the nice weather.
Benjamin P: Yeah, it's been cooler here too. I'm in Georgia and it's cooled down a little bit. I don't expect it to last. We're not quite through the summer yet. So I'm sure we'll get another heat wave come through at some point.
Eric S: Yeah. Take it while you can. So what were you able to come up with to help us out? And.
Greg H: Help Greg?
Eric S: With what he's trying to do. And then also just overall just understanding where we're coming from as far as reducing cost and being more efficient.
Benjamin P: Yeah. So based on the last discussion that we had, which I know it's been a couple weeks, but the things that we highlighted were credit usage optimization and reducing cost because you guys are moving over to the consumption model and you want to make sure that is managed better than it is today. Is that correct?
Eric S: Yeah, which by the way we received an invoice, I was a little surprised. So I thought that might be a little premature given where we stand. So I don't know if you knew that or who's in charge of that or, you know?
Benjamin P: But yeah, I think, Justin looks like he's on the call. He's part of your account team. I would say that he, I'm certainly not part of that, but he should know more. I would say, yeah, was it for the renewal that you received the invoice?
Eric S: It was over 70,000. So it had better been for the renewal?
Benjamin P: Yeah, I'm guessing that what that's what that was. So.
Eric S: Yeah. So, so we just parked that I didn't enter that I'm waiting, you know, until we figure out what we're going to do before I do anything with that?
Benjamin P: Yeah, that's fine. Sure… sounds good. Well, yeah, that sounds like we can focus on that as our primary objective throughout this engagement, with me and the two of you and we can certainly tackle that. While we're talking about that. Another couple things that we mentioned on the previous call that I also wanted to bring up to see if that's something that we wanted to explore or if we just wanted to put most of our effort on this credit optimization task. But we talked about reporting and productivity analytics, for the different locations… that you have. You said you had 15 locations and a few different emrs. And so consolidating that reporting and providing you with greater visibility and staffing is something that you think would be providing value look. From.
Eric S: my standpoint, I really want to stay focused. I don't want to lose sight of, our main objective here. I think we should really focus in on that. And once that's behind us, then I would love to take a look at all that other stuff, but I really don't you know, I hate to be kind of so single minded but that's really kind of where we're at right now.
Benjamin P: No, that, I completely understand that. And one of the things that we wanted to do is sort of understand not just today but how demo can serve you and provide value to your company in the long term. And so identifying those doesn't necessarily mean that we're going to put our focus on implementing those right now. It's more of to give both myself and you a more holistic view of how we plan to proceed. Certainly we can as far as execution and effort we can focus on, you know, the credit usage optimization piece of this. But as a, on our side that's one of the things, that we were hoping to achieve is a better understanding how number one, how you're using the demo platform today, but how you might be interested in using it in the future, and how we, as a team providing you with those free services, we as a team can assist you with helping you get to that point.
Greg H: Yeah.
Eric S: Absolutely. Look, the quicker we get through the first objective, the sooner we can get to the second one. So, you know, if it's done quickly, then we're on to the second one quickly. So I'm all for that.
Benjamin P: Okay. So as far as that outlet goes, it sounds like we've got two areas but one that we just want to focus on right now and so we can certainly do that. As we talk about credit utilization and optimization, I will need access to your instance so that I can go in there and assist you with accomplishing this goal. Shane's on the call too, I see. And he's another consultant on our side who will be working together to tackle this. And so do you have, you know, I know that many customers who began on the traditional model built their data flows and architecture in a way that doesn't necessarily isn't the most optimal in terms of how it's consuming credits. And so, I have to imagine you've got many data flows running on schedules that may be running more frequently than you need. And maybe you have more data flows than you need. I don't know if you guys are using dataset use today. Once we have an opportunity to jump in your instance, then I'll have a better idea of how everything's structured, can?
Greg H: You give me a little bit of, yeah, yeah, that was my thing today's. Call was going to be already. I got it. This morning. I created a new group called the Domo account team and I figured I'd add you guys to that. I did get some of the governance, well, the domostats datasets and the governance, some governance dashboard stuff just to help me visualize it. But what I'm still trying to figure out is if there's a way to create like a recursive query that sort of shows you like when we have data flows that feed data flows that feed data, right? If it's a chain, how can I say, hey, this one card here's all the data refreshes that feed into it, right? Like this one card because it's the end product of like three or four different etls is actually costing us 50 credits every time we want to update it, right?

They collaborated to find a solution, with Mamta suggesting the use of a ""run date"" field instead of the current date to ensure the data shown is for the correct day, and Raymond agreeing to implement the necessary changes in a new ""beast mode"" to address the issue.","Brian F: hello?
Mamta B: Goodbye?
Raymond A: Good morning.
Brian F: Good morning. Sorry. Hi, Mamta. Hi, Brian, mom. I think there's a little bit of feedback. I feel like I keep hitting myself coming from your speaker. Yeah, I'm driving. I'll be in the office like in two minutes, okay?
Raymond A: Sorry, I'm late.
Brian F: No problem.
Raymond A: All right. Shelly, can't make it? Let's see. Sorry, I'm trying to go through my notes. All right. So, one question was, what is the credit usage for forms? Is there a credit usage for forms? Because I think it does utilize a table?
Mamta B: So, when the form writes to the data set, I think that uses a credit.
Raymond A: Every time it writes. So, like if I update. Say, I update a row?
Mamta B: I don't think it should be taking one credit, but I can check and get back to you on that.
Raymond A: Okay.
Mamta B: But you're talking about workflow forms, right? The forms that trigger the workflow?
Raymond A: Like the form that we created or that you helped me create?
Mamta B: Yeah… yeah. I can confirm on that for you.
Raymond A: Okay, great. Aside from that, I think I don't really have any topics. So, I've been slammed with new requests lately… so. Gupta helped me with another issue today with utc. So… maybe you can check our work here. That would be, yeah, I think that would be helpful. Let me share my screen one second. So, just to give you an idea… of what I'm trying to do now, see, we have… this trends card, for example, we have obviously, we have all of last year's volume from… year… to date, right? And beyond, right to the end of the year. And then we also have a plan now, with that data loaded in there, it gives us the ability to see right these weeks that have not occurred yet. Now, I changed… our data set to look forward 10 days to pull in volume. Now, we don't need that for this card specifically. And actually, that poses some trouble. Now, I fixed it because… what I did was I basically wrote a beast mode that said if the adjusted due date is less than or… no. I said if the adjusted due date is current day or greater, then make the shipment count zero, right? Because I only want to count up until yesterday, right? So basically just truncates the, you know, any volume that's technically in our data set. But again, I don't want to see it because what it does to this like… 10 days is going to give me the 20 sixth. So, I'm going to see volume in the week ending 20 third and it's not the week ending the 20 third yet. So, because there's only minimal shipments, in that week and even the rest of this week, what it does is it takes this, you know, it takes a percentage and it plummets into the 20 third and it's like a really low number and it just looks terrible honestly. And besides that, we don't need figures for next week or even, you know, just today or beyond, right? So we only want to preserve it for the current week ending Sunday through yesterday, right? And that gives us the correct 82 point five percent. But at, I would say it's eight o'clock Eastern Time… that beast mode technically, at eight o'clock Eastern Time, it's midnight utc… right? So, What that does is it brings in the volume for the next day, and we didn't want that. So, so Gupta suggested to use, current time… in conjunction with the, I can show you the. I can show you the beast mode. Oops. Yeah. So Gupta suggested with the… volume, let's see, yeah, revised volume. Okay. So, we have future dates with the volume, so need to wipe out anything from today and forward. So, here's, that code. It's just saying adjusted due date. If it's less than today, then just give me the volume else, make it zero, right? But we need to expand this to compensate for the utc time because, Because that issue, we don't want to see, we don't want to see tomorrow's volume. At, well, we'll say it this way, anybody looking at it from Pacific Time, utc… midnight is four PM pacific, right? So that's way too early to… right… to recognize tomorrow's shipments?
Mamta B: So, got it. So, if you go to company settings, what?
Raymond A: Well, we can't change, we can't change that. It's it's definitely changed. It's definitely set to utc.
Mamta B: It's set to utc. What is your data coming in? Is it coming in utc? Because Domo expects the data to be in utc? If your, if your company settings is in utc and your data is coming in utc, then technically, you should not be running into an issue. But if your data is coming in est, right? Then we have to adjust it to utc. So then everybody then you should, then the weeks and everything would get aligned.
Raymond A: I just don't want to, even, I just don't want to recognize it.
Brian F: Well, it's still going to be an issue, Mamta, because even assuming that both things are utc.
Raymond A: When it becomes.
Brian F: Midnight utc, so the data, the utc time is going to flip over to the fifteenth at four P. M. Just make it. I think it is whatever it is. Four P. M west coast time, right? And I think what he's saying is that's too, he doesn't want that to show up really until the… middle, call it the middle of the night, Pacific Time.
Raymond A: We'll say we'll say six o'clock right? Because now we do want to accommodate for like asiapac, like APAC, so we do want them. We do want, we are going to actually run, a midnight refresh, but I don't want, I don't want tomorrow's gosh, how do I explain this? Like it makes so much sense in my head but I can't communicate it. We can, we can run the refresh at say six o'clock pacific, which… would be two o'clock utc, two am utc. And that's fine for APAC, right? If we refresh it at say two am because now they're getting, you know, some fresh data. But before that time, we don't want… those shipments creeping into, the, to the cards because it starts throwing things off.
Brian F: So, without looking here, sorry, how often does this data set get updated?
Raymond A: Once a day, well, we're going to change it though to accommodate APAC, and APAC, you know, they're you know, they're working in the middle of the night and that's fine.

Alex D: Hey, Keaton. How you doing?
Keaton M: Good. How are you? Sorry. I had a meeting run long?
Alex D: No, no big deal. Perfect. All right, Keaton. I don't know how you want to go about this. One way is to show me where you're at right now, and I can provide any support where you need it. I was able to whip up a demo myself. I think it's based off of Scott's explanation. I think it's kind of close to what your use case should be, but however you want to facilitate it, that's up to you dude. So, let me know.
Keaton M: For sure. Yeah, let me see if I can, yeah, let's pull this up… and I can run through it real quick. Let me share my screen. So I have two applications, I guess, which I just built this, to kind of test, ag, grid. And then we have the other one, which is the live one… This is the live one. That kind of is more of the graph, the graphing focused one. So I think the goal here is to kind of combine the two, and… see what we can do to, yeah, so see, see if we can combine the two, basically, make it more graphical, but also easier to, input kind of like ag grid, and things like that. Do we want to, I guess, I can see what you got so far, or we can go through what I have so far. Either, either way, I don't know where you're at on it.
Alex D: Yeah. So, actually, I'll just give you like a quick two second snapshot of, what I put together and we'll see if we're close. And if I've got any code that maybe, you could utilize to help you, get to the next step, Right now?
Keaton M: And that's… that.
Alex D: So, it's actually pretty similar to what you got. I was just putting together a couple of different demos based on, I wasn't sure what kind of use case we were looking at, but after I got some clarity, I think it's pretty similar to what you were showing just now. This allows you, I just put in a bunch of dummy data which is generated by AI. But, you can select, you know, what vendor or account that you're talking about and some basic data entry. The idea here, is that you fill in the projections. I'm hoping this is where you were going with this. I don't know if this is dollars or quantity, but you can fill that in it'll, market, and then you can go ahead and save that, it'll save the data for you. But it sounds like maybe you're not, this is the actual grid itself is not the issue. Is it, is it like saving the data? Is it combining the chart with the data?
Keaton M: Yeah. It's more of combining the chart with the data, as well because I think, because I have a submit button already, I think it works good. I guess the other thing I kind of need help with, is, I want this to be more of a, I think we're changing to a rolling, rolling time period. I think that would be more dynamic. I would have to edit it less things like that. And so that right now, it's static. What else?
Alex D: So, I,
Keaton M: guess one.
Alex D: One way we can think about this Keaton, is really what the, my understanding of the process, is some data needs to be pulled into the app, that data needs to be displayed in ag grid. You should be able to enter or like, as a draft, start updating your information within that ag grid, be able to hit save, and then it should go back to the endpoint which it originally was extracted from. Is that correct? Like kind of, the process flow?
Keaton M: Yeah.
Alex D: So, the first question, is, where does this data exist right now? Is it within Domo, is it on a server?
Keaton M: Yeah. So, it's with it's using Domo's appdb right now?
Alex D: So, and the data, so that, that's the source of truth then, right? So, this isn't stored on like a server or anything, it's stored on appdb? Okay. Appdb.
Keaton M: Is the only source? Okay?
Alex D: So then it is just a clean read from appdb update in UI, save the updates, push back to appdb. And then you're gonna also need to have that appdb synced up to a dataset so then you can bring that into the chart or any other graphs or anything to go along with it. So from those like that's, kind of like step by step, what steps do you have complete and what steps are still missing some functionality?
Keaton M: Yeah, let's. let me show you the code I got. So sounds… good. To, so currently, we are, do I have any code in here? No. Okay. So this is the, it sets the column definitions, right? Yep for ag grid. This sets the date, I guess. And then… yeah, this generates the month keys of what we're currently pulling in for the data. It fetches what we call the pricing. So this is something we have talked about changing as well where we have a forecast per price id. But really all it needs to be is by SKU retailer ship method combination. If that makes sense. So that's something we can talk about changing later. But just… because it can some, we can sometimes have duplicate skew ship method, retailer combinations where we're… changing. For example, if we're changing a… if we're changing a factory or a country of origin, the price can change. So we have to reprice it but it doesn't necessarily change the forecast if that makes sense. But anyway… that's what we're that's the current. This is actually pulling from the business plan. So I need to change that, but then it fetches the forecasting data, grabs… the month keys… makes the price id is unique just in case there's any duplicates. What… are… we doing here? Gotta remember. And then for each month, yeah. So for each month key, we find we match the price id for the forecast in the forecasting database and then match that and the month to the month key to pull in because the way it's stored is by, I guess is… each individual month and price id has its own document number, I guess… instead of storing all the months… in the same document. So that's kind of what. So that's what makes it a little difficult when trying to get the actual data for the table, but that's kind of what this is doing is getting every single month and matching it up with the price id… and then setting the row data there. I think it's also getting. Am I pulling? I'm not. Okay. Yeah. And I thought I was maybe pulling in extra information but it looks like I'm oh, I'm pul",Consumption Pricing Model,112011.84,Corporate,BLACKSTONEPRODUCTS.COM,4,Logistics & Wholesale Distribution,180,$50M to <$100M,Upsell,Blank,4: Confirm Solution,Simeon Nielsen,2025-12-16,2025-04-01,2025-04-01,2025-04-30,2025-05-21,,,,0013800001L9xIDAAZ

Good. Yeah, I've actually finally had a little bit of time today. I've been digging into some of the data sets and I do have a few questions… awesome.
Benjamin P: Hey, gentlemen.
Greg H: Hey, how's it going?
Benjamin P: Going good. I believe will should be here any second. Now. I'm just laying a weight on him since he built up most of this.
Greg H: Yeah. I mean, and the biggest question I have, it makes a lot of sense is I'm trying to, and maybe it was addressed last week or whenever we talked, but if there's a way to see like the lineage that each thing is a part of. So, like because I want my first cut to be like if I'm looking at a lineage that says, hey, the first data set updates… every hour, but the next data set in the lineage only updates once per day. Well, then there's no point in updating the first one every hour. If the downstream one's only updating once a day, right? And powering like it's like, okay, well, yeah.
Benjamin P: For sure.
Greg H: Like, it doesn't make any sense. So, I'm trying to find those low hanging fruit first, but I'm like, all right. Well, is there a way in the data set that's created to say, hey, here's, all the data sets in the lineage and how often they're updating and you'd be like, oh, yep. We have got a mismatch. And then I can look at it and be like, okay, this is fine.
Benjamin P: Yeah. Do you have your demo screen pulled up?
Greg H: Yeah. Give me a second. I'm so used to teams… do.
Benjamin P: We need to send these through teams going forward.
Greg H: No, either or is fine. No, I use zoom quite a bit, but just recently, it's been all teams. Okay. Yeah. So this is the demo. So let me just show and share what I've been doing. So I downloaded the data, right? Just so it was easier to just like pivot really quickly. And so for example, I'm saying, okay here's all my standard credits in use that are powering zero cards. Now, that doesn't mean they're not actually in use but it's like there's no direct link, right? So then I was looking, okay, this one this year has 163 credits used and it's not powering any cards, right? So then I'm like, okay… I'm going to use this one and then I came over here and that's what I'm trying to like sort of piece together. And then like, and I can see like this is probably something we had intended to use it for more. It's going to these two data sets and that's, it probably could have been folded into these into this one, right? It's its own data flow, but it probably could have just been incorporated into this one, right? Instead of having to be its own data flow. So that's one problem, right? Or one room for improvement going forward. But then I'm like, okay, this only ran like anyway… I'm trying to figure out there if there are multiple steps in the lineage, I'm trying to find like what's the true limiting factor and then be like, okay, can we get everything to that limiting factor, right? Because there's other things obviously that are happening here, this one to be deleted so that one can go away, right? Like I said, right now, the first pass, I'm just trying to find the low hanging fruit… and what's the best way to do that from a lineage perspective? Like to be like, okay, how else do I find? What else from this data set is in that lineage?
Benjamin P: I'm going to share my screen for here just a second. And then I'll pass it off to will. Okay, he can get through, right?
Greg H: Because the way I've been doing it now, like I'm using the pivot table to quickly identify something. But then I'm still having to Qlik through a bunch of stuff in Domo to try to piece together the story. I'm like man, I'm hoping there's a better way for.
Benjamin P: Sure. We have this data flow that will created that creates this output. But one of the inputs to this ETL that I created is this lineage dataset. So if you go to the original dataset id, this is the actual source data. So like if I just chose any dataset in your instance, so if I just go to datasets and just randomly choose, okay, average health score. And I wanted to know well, what is the total lineage for this specific dataset? I could then go up here and obviously, we know that each card in your instance can only be powered by one dataset. And so if I wanted to know like what's the lineage of this card, right? Then I would just figure that, okay, what's the dataset that powers it? Get that dataset id. And inside of this dataset lineage, if I filter by this original dataset id, I can then see that, okay, that has three items. So there's three total datasets that are in the lineage for that resulting output. And then somewhere here, okay, we have distance right here. So I'm gonna go to, I'm… gonna find that dataset again. So I'm just gonna go to that dataset there. So this is the dataset that we were doing that for average health score. If I go to lineage, we can see that it has… give it a second to load.
Greg H: This is only eight columns. It.
Benjamin P: Has three datasets and you can see that it's not multi layered. It's just one layer, right? So we have three inputs. And therefore this distance only has a value of one. Now, if it had three datasets that all had a value of one and one that had a value of two. That would mean that there's two layers on that sequence that lineage, right? Gotcha. And so this dataset basically tabulates… the lineage… for you for all of your datasets. So hopefully that's helpful.
Greg H: Yeah. So what I could do is then like sort of and maybe you've already done this somewhere like join that to be like find me cases where the first level has a different number of credits used than the second layer and that would tell us like, okay, something's this one's triggering like on every hour and this one's only triggering once a day. And so, therefore you've got a lot more credits at one step.
Benjamin P: Versus the.
Greg H: Other.
Benjamin P: Yeah. I think with the work that will's done and that lineage, we could certainly add to this to give you that context.
Greg H: Yeah, like I said, yeah, like I said right now, I was just trying to like, I didn't have a chance until today to dive i",Consumption Pricing Model,70223.8,Corporate,KOLMAC.COM,3,Healthcare & Health Services,138,$10M to <$25M,Upsell,Blank,Closed Won,Justin Labrum,2025-09-11,2025-08-29,2025-09-05,2025-09-05,2025-09-05,2025-09-05,2025-09-11,,0015w00002Tn9enAAB

Brian M: Happy Friday guys.
Fui K: Happy Friday. Not sure. Can you see us?
Brian M: I could see you guys. Can you see me?
Fui K: No, no, yeah.
Brian M: Hey guys. How are you?
Fui K: Hello, Brian. Oh, there we go. Yep.
Brian M: Jacob, I'm sending you a note.
Fui K: What's going on? How are we doing?
Brian M: Good.
Fui K: And Brian, I'll take your lead if you think we should, if you want us to wait till rani or others might want to join.
Brian M: Yeah, let's see… where rani is. Okay? Oh, she's there?
Fui K: Boom. Sounds good. Hey, rani. How's it going? Hey, good. How's it going? Doing well, doing well. Appreciate the both of you hopping on for our monthly sync. I know Brian and I, we had a pretty extensive conversation earlier this week and so, yeah… we'll dive into the agenda today. Brian. This is kind of the, I know it's been a few months since we've looked at adoption in advance. So we'll just quickly look at usage, right? If you have any questions there, appreciate you sending the dataset ids and instance ids. So, Riley and our engineering team are working on the retag once that's completed, I'll circle back and give you some updates there. But then I think majority of our time will be on this second point here, Brian, and would love again just for you to cover some of the points that you brought up with me over the phone. I think there are some valid things to discuss and that's why we brought in the leadership guns, right? With Sione and Jacob and to make sure that you're fully on board top down. But then from there, if there is a way for us to schedule the onsite, I know we've been talking about it for a few months, but it'd be great to schedule the working session, especially with some of the use cases and expanding, you know, things that you talked about especially as it relates to AI and whatnot, and then we'll go from there. So any questions on the agenda or outline?
Brian M: No, I really think for point three. Let me just take that with Oliver. Okay? We'll take it from there.
Fui K: Got it. And again, we're as far as on site again, we do have resources. Other folks that, you know, are more than happy to come on site from our team. So looking at adoption at a glance, none of this should be new to you. I think you're very familiar, right? With your instance and usage. I did notice a decrease in total users. I think I saw a 50 a couple months ago, and now we're at 45 across four different email domains. The email domains are about the same, some people.
Brian M: Got fired.
Fui K: Oh, okay. Got it. Some of that. Okay. That makes sense. Thank you for the heads up there, but usage wise, adoption, again, things are looking well, looking good here… from again adoption and advance in terms of card loads or interactions, right? From cardview's standpoint, I know that there are seasonality or there is some seasonality, right? Based on the events and timing. So we have seen a little bit of a drop off rate over the last couple months. So I think we'll dive into that a little bit more in the leadership conversation. But I do want to highlight that we have seen a little bit of AI being leveraged over the last couple months, you know, from chat and then, you know, some specific requests I think that falls in suit with some of the conversations we've had with Shana, our solutions consultant, you know, over the last couple months as well. So any questions or anomalies or feedback regarding usage from you, Brian, or from me? Rani?
Brian M: No, I think we're in the good.
Fui K: Cool. Alrighty. So yeah, moving on again, Brian as always appreciate the transparency and the feedback here. But I broke down our conversation really into three different elements, right? Number one, you know, the feedback in terms of like, hey, this isn't just for fancapital. This is across the board, right? With just giving some time and grace period. Again, we're working with our engineering team here. The other thing that you mentioned, right? Is like, hey, we're you know, given the change, like it's just something for us to talk about, right? With leadership that we are having to somewhat rethink or, you know, possibly rebuild the architecture based on the consumption model. So I wanted to dive into that. And then I do love the point that you brought up in terms of AI, right? AI, it's really going to come down to live data and card views. But we also want to make sure that from a future state standpoint that we're meeting you and giving you enough capacity there. So would love to just open up the, you know, the conversation, Brian, to any other specific things that, you know, that you'd like to elaborate on. And again, we have the right resources from a leadership standpoint with Sione and Jacob I'm on the phone here.
Brian M: Where do I begin? Where do I begin? Where do I begin? So let's just chat on the second bullet through first. I guess… props to Oliver. I know he's not on this call but he's been, really strong with us with regards to thinking through and having, you know, a conversation… and it really spurned my thought but he's really been good with getting the ball moving on that too with regards to saying, yeah, maybe you do need a concept of a new data architecture piece. He gave me some food for thought since we last spoke… and. I'm going to start digging in heavily. I have a conversation next week with the BA on my side with regards to rebuilding. I don't even know. I think that the concept of leveraging through cloud accelerator… quite honestly is something that Oliver's pointed out with regards to it's. Really a smart way for us to think through… like how that concept fits into our data and how that should be used for our data. And I have a conversation with my BA on Monday to look at how we're taking and, we have things coming into Domo directly. And what if we did that via our, what if we brought everything into Aws and back down into snowflake and then having Domo pull from snowflake… via cloud? What that would do to our environments? So I think that I'm going to kick off the conversation on my end with my BA on Monday to start discussing th",Consumption Pricing Model,213625.0,Corporate,ALCORITY.COM,3,High Tech,69,$10M to <$25M,Upsell,Blank,1: Pre-Pipeline,Oliver Lange,2026-01-29,2025-02-07,,,,,,,0015w000025b89hAAA

Michael N: Doug?
Dale W: That'll be fun.
Michael N: Yeah… it's going to be an interesting call. He put together a really good email this morning. I got to get him some documentation, but I think it's some of the things that you're asking for Dale that he's trying to gather for you. Okay? Which makes me happy. I'm very happy that you can be a part of that.
Dale W: But he hasn't responded to me, so.
Michael N: That's a surprise.
Dale W: And he went to anyway, I have a feeling where he got his information from. It's a little bit of a telephone game, but that's fine as long as it's getting.
Joe P: There.
Michael N: Yeah. And it looks like he listed some of the things that ipg wants to do that will certainly help reduce some of the costs which I'm happy about.
Dale W: Okay.
Michael N: The one thing while we're waiting for Joe to join, the, one thing I wanted to talk about is I met with Shane yesterday, Shane wright, and he keeps asking, is there anything he can do to help out? I think he's that team definitely wants to be able to show that they made an impact. They are, you know, this is a new program for us. And with any new program, the measurement, the key metric is effectiveness. Were they able to drive new use cases, things like that? So if there's anything that pops up, I know you guys, you have a lot on your plate, but if anything pops up where you're saying, hey, we could use an extra pair of hands. He's… a hands on keyboard Guy. He's not a strategy Guy. He's a here's what we want to do, go do it kind of Guy. And it's there's no charge for it. So if it's something that could be useful to you, great… if not that's okay, also.
Dale W: The, the… one thing that I think would be kind of a wow moment is something we were trying to do last year and we just never got to it and I think it comes down to two things. One, can we make Domo itself embeddable which I think you can, there's just a couple of steps to do so. And then the other thing was that instance selector page and trying to drive that whole construct of instance selector. And so I'd like to be able to kind… of expound on that. There is, you know, zero documentation on how to make that work. And I think Carl, you were on the other side of that one you were wearing blue back then. Yup. But, you know, because we had that one call with the one person and, you know, she basically had to describe it to us.
Michael N: Okay. Yeah.
Karl A: That was mental.
Dale W: And I still don't have clarity as to what all of that is. But I mean, we're sub instancing more, right?
Michael N: Yup. And.
Dale W: I think having people giving people the ability to use a dispatcher enabling demo or some type of embeddable demo as well, even if we need to sub instance it out to make some of these things happen? Like I think we're going to need that. And so having that capability fleshed out because it's so brand new one. I think, you know, having someone like Shane chase that down because… it's going to require a lot of chasing.
Michael N: Got it. Yeah, that's good. I mean, this is the kind of stuff he wants. So this is perfect. Can I, can I schedule a meeting with him a call and Dale, should you and Carl both be on that? How, who should I schedule with that?
Dale W: Do.
Karl A: you mind if I take this one? Dale? Because, this is something which interests me quite a lot. And yeah, it is something that we, I remember us speaking about last year?
Dale W: Yeah. If you want to get it started, then let's make sure we fully define the problem. And then before you hit go, we'll all meet and kind of say, yeah, that's what we're trying to hit.
Karl A: Okay. That sounds good. In that case, then I will, I'll let you know when, well, I'll just book some time with you, when the problem is defined and we can review it.
Michael N: Perfect. Yeah. And Shane's ready to go anytime.
Dale W: Well, work with Shane to try to figure out the spec of it and then get to that final decision and then just kind of cue me in when you're ready.
Karl A: Oh, I see. Okay. Yeah, we can do that instead. All right, Mike, I will. I'll can you show me through some times when I can meet with him next week?
Michael N: Yeah, absolutely.
Karl A: All right. Thank you.
Michael N: You got it. Is. What's is your Monday Tuesday look super full? Carl? The only reason I'm asking is I'm out next Wednesday, Thursday, Friday and I'd love to. I'd love to just be a part of the first call just to understand the problem.
Karl A: Yeah, Monday, I think after three or Tuesday morning?
Michael N: Okay. Let me look at his schedule right now… and if you don't want me there, just feel free to say, no.
Dale W: You're gonna need to be the one turning on the feature switches, so.
Michael N: He's got a bunch of tentatives Monday afternoon, but he's free all Monday morning. Let me, let me ping him. I think a lot of these tentatives are just placeholders so, let me see if I can clear some of these out. You said after three Carl? Oh, you know, what? Has three 30, Monday work.

Benjamin P: I doubt… it. It's a react thing. It uses react and redux… that's part of the reason why I'm struggling. But, yeah.
Ankit S: Excuse me… what's up, Shane?
Shane W: Just crushing it. I had a little procedure… done this morning, like I had like a little skin thing that I had to get removed and I felt fine. And then now I'm just like it's starting to like really bother me. So I'm like, oh, I think I might go home. I'm having a hard time focusing.
Ankit S: Boy… but,
Shane W: it looks kind of cool. It's like frankenstein.
Ankit S: Nice.
Shane W: I had a big white gauze on it the first thing this morning.
Benjamin P: Huh. If anybody asks, just say you can see what the other Guy looks like?
Ankit S: Is it a, it's not like a sister or anything, right?
Shane W: No, I can't I don't know what they, I can't remember the name of it, but it was like a little cancerous thing, but it wasn't like they said, it's not dangerous. It just will be like an irritant. And so they said, just get it removed. So, I did gotcha. And part of me is like, did I really need to do it? I don't know, these guys probably need some money. So, I guess I'll do it for them so they can buy food for their families. But… yeah, no, they're anyways, so, I did it and it's I'm… second guessing myself now, but.
Ankit S: They.
Shane W: also told me, they said, oh, it's gonna be like really small. It's not, you're not gonna be able to see it. And I'm like, I don't think that, that's small.
Ankit S: Yeah. Did you, so you went to a dermatologist, I'm assuming?
Shane W: Yeah, yeah.
Ankit S: Yeah.
Benjamin P: I, anyways,
Ankit S: I had a, like, probably like an eyeball sized cyst on my back and it did get, it did get to a point where it was just hurting. And I'm glad I got it taken out. But, yeah… there's a pretty gnarly scar back there.
Shane W: Yeah. He's like they were like super impressed with their work that's what it sounded like. When they were doing it like, yeah, this is going to be good. This is gonna, this is going to help real nice. So, I need to give it a little bit of time, but I'm right now, I'm like, oh, I hope I don't that scar does is much less noticeable in a few weeks.
Ankit S: I'm going to say on camera, it looks like it blends into your hair. So.
Shane W: That's what they, that's what they, that's part of what they're saying that it will blend in. Yeah, I think part of it is that it's just kind of, inflamed right now and yeah, when they went out exactly.
Ankit S: You're like, you're like, Delmo's, Omar from the wire. I don't know if you guys are a fan of the show, but he has a scar on his face.
Shane W: Oh, I asked if they could do it here like as a lightning bolt… but they said we can't do that.
Ankit S: Dude, I would, that would make me so happy. I'm such a big Harry potter fan.
Shane W: Oh, well, I guess we got, I think we got ghosted.
Ankit S: I think that might be the case. I was hoping we'd be able to, let me email Jack. Are we planning to present something to him today?
Benjamin P: No.
Ankit S: There's just going to be additional discovery today. Well… give… it a couple more minutes and then we'll call it. When are you, flying out, Ben tomorrow?
Benjamin P: Yep.
Ankit S: Morning?
Benjamin P: Tomorrow, for… well, we have to drive out. We have to drive to Atlanta. It's like two and a half, three hours, and then our flight leaves at four, 15, something like that?
Shane W: When did you just tune your dad?
Benjamin P: 413, he leaves at 413. And so, we'll probably leave here. We'll leave the house tomorrow, probably around 10 a. M to get down there a couple hours early. We'll eat lunch, and then, yeah, I mean, I always try to get at, get to Atlanta a couple hours early anyway, just in case because it's such a busy airport, so.
Ankit S: Yeah.
Benjamin P: Huge, it says, I have 30 32 minutes. I can check in 32 minutes. So… yep, so it says we're going to get there to Indianapolis at 540 tomorrow, so that means we'll probably get, we'll get there in time to eat. We can eat dinner there tomorrow… afternoon tomorrow night. So.
Ankit S: Oh, that's east coast time as well. Yeah, I thought they were central.
Benjamin P: No, they're east coast.
Ankit S: It's going to be nice there this weekend too. It's going to be nice.
Benjamin P: Here over the weekend as well. I actually think it's going to be warmer in Indianapolis than it's going to be here in Georgia. Yeah, which is kind of crazy, but the high… here on Sunday is 84 and… in Indianapolis, the highest one day is 87. So… it'll be a nice day though. If you happen to watch the colts on TV, you may see me.
Ankit S: Yeah. Where are you guys sitting?
Benjamin P: Like on the side, like closer to the end zone, like we're on the short end, like where the end zone is. And so, we're closer to the corner, but, and we're close to the bottom, so, it's like right next to the tunnel where they come out. Cool. And so,
Ankit S: Oh, yeah, that's a pretty good shot of seeing you on TV then.
Benjamin P: Yeah, let's see time in. We're not going to fail you. You can stop recording if you want.

Katie B: Oh, maybe I was going to say there's a definite possibility that it's going to be weird. I'm on a hot spot because I am moving and I'm actually in my new place that doesn't have internet yet.
Juliana J: Okay. I just, I think maybe one of the last times we met, I was going through the same thing and I had to go to starbucks to get WI fi. So I totally understand you that's okay. And if we need to turn off if we.
Katie B: Need.
William W: to.
Juliana J: turn off cameras or something too. We can do that if it helps with your connection too. I.
Katie B: Was going to say, yeah, we'll try that and then Walter's here too for support.
Juliana J: Okay. Hey, Walter. Good to meet you.
Walter M: Good to meet you as well.
Juliana J: Good. I know we only have 30 minutes here. Do we want to do some quick introductions for Walter? Just so Walter knows who we all are? And then we can jump right into what we have prepared for today?
Walter M: Sure. I think that'd be a great idea.
Juliana J: All right. Awesome. So, I'm Juliana, I'm a project manager here at Domo. So I help with our consulting team. I work hand in hand with Nick and will and a bunch of other consultants here and help drive projects, schedule calls, make sure everybody knows what's going on at all times. So I'll pass it over to Nick.
Nik K: I'm Nick Kumar, I'm a principal technical consultant at Domo been in here about four years, and then two years as a Domo client before that. And yeah, I primarily help clients with data architecture, implementing pipelines into Domo and then any transformations within Domo and how to structure that… pass it over to will?
William W: Will I'm a senior technical consultant trying to catch up to Nick, but, you know, he widens that gap every single day. So, but yeah, I'll be helping out with or I helped out with the governance element of this, and then I'll be popping in to help out as the team needs. And Katie, I have to tell you, I got a chance to see a number of the things that you've done in this instance, I'm a fan of your work. You're an absolute monster. So I have to call you out for a half second. You do some pretty good stuff in here.
Katie B: Well, thank you. I appreciate that.
William W: Yeah, absolutely. Walter or Katie, whichever one of you two wants to go next.
Katie B: I'll let Walter go.
Walter M: Okay. Yeah, sure thing. Hi, everybody. Great to meet you. I'm Walter Mann. I'm on the account team here at Lewis media. I've been on… the account team here for three and a half years, a little bit more than that at this point. And yeah, as of late, I've been sort of helping Katie out just with her team mainly because I had the wonderful opportunity earlier this year to attend omopalooza out in salt lake. So, yeah, came back with some, really great exciting things to share with my team. So, yeah, great to meet you all.
Juliana J: Awesome.
Katie B: And then I'm Katie blood. So I've been with Lewis media for four years now and Walter is helping me out, but I will say is that it's not my team anymore because it's just me right now. So we are going through a transition period, but yeah, I'm more on the infrastructure side, but right now, kind of covering all of our analytics spaces.
William W: You're definitely doing that, Katie, looking at how much stuff you own in there, it's gonna, we're gonna walk you through the governance dashboard and you're gonna look like an absolute rock star by the end of this meeting. So I'm just prepping you for that. We didn't have time to roll out the red carpet in your new place, but we'll shoot one out to you here soon.
Katie B: I will say, I mean, we had, we've had some great people over the years. So it's not all me, that is for sure. But it's definitely what we have now compared to what we had when I started is by far and away way better. So.
William W: Amazing. And Walter, I, for what it's worth and you'll see this. I'm sure you're in there. It's just Katie like silhouettes everyone in her impact. So not to like diminish your impact as well, good, sir.
Walter M: No, all good. I actually try to not make an impact because I will break something in the dashboard. We've joked for years that I would try to do that. And now I actually can, so I.
William W: try.
Walter M: not to do that.
William W: Your demo role allows for it now.
Walter M: Amazing. That's a terrifying thing.
William W: Amazing. Well, I'll hand it over to Juliana or Nick to steer the conversation, but thanks for humoring me on my call outs. Sure. Thank you. Yeah.
Juliana J: I think the first thing we wanted to walk through was that the governance dashboard that we deployed, right? Is that.
Nik K: Yeah. I think largely our goal was to a, give you some visibility and just the tools to understand what's in your instance and monitor it going forward, right? But Katie, one of the things you'd mentioned was just how do we start creating this architecture of a modular architecture, right? As you bring different clients? So you're not repeating work and you don't have this disjointed sort of pipelines within your instance. So first step is visibility into it. So will has put together a pretty detailed dashboard so we can walk through it first cut, right? If there's more information, we need any surprises that come out, let's take it from there.
William W: Sounds good.
Nik K: All right. Will you're on mute?
William W: Okay. Thank you. So for what it's worth if this feels a little overwhelming at first, it's meant to kick off with like a better to have it and not need it than need it and not have it thing. So this may feel like a lot. It's really meant to give you all of the tools and then as you need them, you'll just pull them out. But I did want to err on the side of overkill and then just make sure that, you know, it's yours to own if you need to thin it out or if you need to get creative, you might have some inspiration in here.

Robert T: I'm good. How are you? Good?
Casey D: Hi, Javier.
Robert T: How's it?
Javier S: Going?
Robert T: All right. The rest of the team can join or not everyone's pretty busy.
Casey D: Okay. Oh, while we wait for them, what do you have going on Robert? What is your main priority and projects and area of interest right now?
Robert T: A little bit of everything really just all over. I'm kind of holding the ropes.
Casey D: Are you heavily involved in the snowflake migration or are you doing other maintenance and projects associated?
Robert T: A little bit about… I'm just trying to kind of support still… our day… to day requests. So we can also focus on the migration. So I'd say a little bit of vote, but… lately it's been kind of heavily. We've been getting a lot of different support requests. So that's been keeping me pretty busy.
Casey D: I get it. How do you have those requests coming in? Are they through like an approval center in Domo or is it?
Robert T: No, just emails for the most part. Yeah. And that's kind of how it works for the most part.
Casey D: What's I going to ask? Oh, are you guys also, so are all the lines of business still on Domo or are you converting some to Power BI because we did talk to Andy and Brittany a couple weeks ago, and it sounded like Power BI was very much still in the equation?
Robert T: Yeah, I'm not too sure on that, but… yeah… I'm not too sure on that one.
Casey D: Well, is there anything we can help with? Do you have anything that either through the requests that you're getting or other tasks on your plate that we can help?
Robert T: With, no, I don't think so. I'm sorry, I'm here on the email chain, I've been out a little bit, so I didn't get to reply to it, but yeah, I think we're good on that load… for the datasets that weren't properly loading. So I saw you went ahead and closed it. So, I think we're good for that. I was able to load what I was needing so, you know, it's been a lot of back and forth on that, but it kept like it kept improving so that's good. And I know you guys made a few changes to help that. So I think it worked.
Casey D: Good deal. Awesome. Are you familiar with some of the August releases that came out? Not next last week? I think it was the week before. Did we talk about that on our last call, some of those features?
Robert T: I think so. I haven't had much time to dig into.
Casey D: Are you involved in kind of any of the pipeline activities between dummo and snowflake? Like with the data warehouse traffic coming in and out or the integrations of data between the two?
Robert T: Not too much. No, I guess not as much on that part. Okay?
Casey D: There were some enhancements and I, yeah… probably more.
Robert T: Lately just been sticking to that history load on my part. Okay? And that's been taken care of?
Casey D: Is that coming in through workbench?
Robert T: No, just the snowflake connector.
Casey D: Oh, that's right. Okay. Good deal. Yeah, I was going to just point this out for Andrew and Catherine if they're interested. But yeah, just some more enhancements in our snowflake integrations especially with the UI and how you're able to kind of direct traffic and, you know, specify certain tables and all that sort of thing even down to the push down processing. So you can do transformations like Domo transformations and magic ETL in snowflake as opposed to having to move all the data to Domo to do that. So, really cool tiles and drag and drop functionality that's still coming out with the transformations and the movement and storage of data in Domo or I'm sorry, in snowflake. So, I think that was the main call out for today. Yeah. I just wanted to talk to Andrew… and Catherine. Do you guys when you're going through kind of like the business and supporting your business users? Do you guys have like a kind of a, some kind of idea of what each department is using Domo for and kind of what they're main use cases are.
Robert T: At a high level, I guess… they can speak better for that because I've been primarily involved with white river and they did things totally different than retail. And now retail is more organized on that?
Casey D: Got it. Okay… for white river? What's the main usage or kind of coming… in?
Robert T: Just tracking manufacturing and sales really. Overall. And then they just slice and dice and everybody kind of gets a little bit of everything.
Casey D: Okay.
Robert T: But yeah, it sounds like they're still preoccupied. So I think that's all I had.
Casey D: Okay. I'll hang on just for a minute in case they join, but I'll let them know that if they do that, you are already on and already spoke with you, but just… let us know. Yeah, if there's anything else we can help with as you guys move towards the end of the year, especially during the busy season that's coming up.
Robert T: Well, I appreciate it. I'll keep you updated if I need more help with the connecting.
Casey D: Yeah, I appreciate it. Thank you, Robert. Thanks for joining us. Thanks for taking your time, yeah.
Robert T: Thanks again.
Casey D: I appreciate.
Robert T: You guys' support. Bye bye.
Casey D: Javier, if you want. I'll just hang on just a couple more minutes just to see if they join, but you can probably jump. I don't think there's no support cases open or anything.
Javier S: Yeah, I don't have anything. I'll hang on for a minute.

Adam D: Cool. Yeah. Thanks for hopping on with.
Tyler C: me. Yeah, no problem. Neil may or may not make it. I invited him, but I really don't need him for this conversation. I just wanted to have you walk me through kind of what you're seeing again and kind of some of these things you're doing just to make sure we're not missing anything kind of like I said in the email, it might need to go to support, but I figured we can jump on and kind of hash it out a little bit first, just so if there is something that we can figure out great. If not, we'll get it to support and then we can facilitate it from there.

Tyler C: Yeah, totally fine.
Adam D: There we go. Okay. So we've got this one pretty basic, just four columns, you know, whatever it is. Something like that and you can see over here. It's showing zero. So update… data… select the sheets. So it's that first one bargain next, we're always doing replace.
Tyler C: Okay.
Adam D: Finish it'll, confirm it. And then it'll say, you know, update has gone successfully and then come back here to where did I put it? I don't think no, there it is. So already… just refresh just to be sure. Last round a few seconds ago, zero.

Adam D: Yeah, there's nothing.
Tyler C: Okay. Just want to make sure. So, okay, so description barcode GR, category associated rep, let's go to the history real quick for me. Yeah. So it seems like it's running, it's just not doing anything, right? Okay. Update. Okay. That's interesting. Okay. Yeah, I mean, yeah. So it's pretty straightforward.
Adam D: Yeah. Most of these from yesterday were from a different team member who kind of controlled that data set, who tried updating it and he came to me and he was like, hey, like what's going on? So, yeah, try it, these two, these last two and then also this first one this morning, just to, you know, see if something changed overnight. But, yeah, we got nothing.
Tyler C: Got it. And then let's go to the settings real quick. I just want to look around and see if there's anything that we can think of here. So that's fine. Let's go to select tables. I want to see what's in here, generate headers, use run numbers, keep leading zeros, problem headers and sections cannot overlap. That's fine. Oh, that's interesting. Yeah. So maybe try doing this real quick if you can. So, the selection section switch that to, a two through. Yeah, I guess like through a two again, let's see if it gets that column headers thing to go away. Yeah, there you go. Okay. So that might've been part of the problem. You can also change this to say like a one. So, for the column headers, a one through a through D1 because that's where the headers would be. Now, I don't know if that matters. You could also just say generate headers, right? But if you want to use the raw numbers, you might have to specify a little bit more of, yeah. So notice how that goes away at that point. And then the raw numbers go. So maybe save this at this point and then try to update it again and let's see if that was causing any issues. I'm curious if it's trying to insert it, but it's inserting the data and the headers in the same thing and saying, hey, sorry, we can't, we don't know what to do. So, it's just doing nothing. So, I'd be curious to see what happens now. If you go and push that. So, now, it's saying that it's successful. And if we refresh real quick. Okay. Let's go back to the settings real quick… select tables… selection a one to a one. If you uncheck the use raw numbers… make sure it's the raw number in the preview section. Yeah, just uncheck that. I want to see if that selection section goes away. No. What we might need to do is just say, I don't know what this section here.
Adam D: Yeah.
Tyler C: And we would probably want to do a two just to give it some room for the headers. Yeah, and see if we can see if that works, right? Let's save that. We're just trying some things and then what's the update mode on this on that settings page real quick. Also replace skip. Perfect. That's fine. Okay. So now let's go try to push it one more time. We're just making sure it's nothing with the settings before we go to support because I don't want them to come back and go, yeah, duh, it's because of this and be like, yeah, we could have checked that, right? So.
Adam D: Yep. Understood.
Tyler C: Yeah. So nothing there, interesting. Okay. So, I mean, as far as I know like this… I mean, it seems like everything's set up correctly? I don't know what else we could potentially do. The only thing, yeah.
Adam D: And also too, like anyway. Yeah. And I don't think this is anything that we changed. I mean, looking at the history of the last time it was updated was July, you know, prior to today?
Tyler C: Yeah.
Adam D: I know there have been, you know, some product enhancements, I guess you'd call them like I'm using the new layout, which I think is awesome, but… know, I don't know if something changed and I'm slightly concerned with it because I know we do have a lot of data sets that are using this excel kind of Qlik method. So I want to get out in front of this and, you know, if this is something that, you know, more people try to update these data sets by excel and, you know, so all our data is going to be good kind of thing. So, I just want to make sure, right? Yeah.

Scott T: What's going on in San Diego? Just a vacation or?
Trevor F: Yeah, it's my wife's birthday. So we're going to see a comedian and then her family's from San Diego. So we'll hang out with them. Nice. How about you? How was your week? Well?
Scott T: We made it to Friday. So it was a success.
Jenna H: That's right?
Trevor F: Is everyone else hopping on?
Scott T: Yeah, I believe so. Yeah. So Jenna and Ivan should both be joining soon. I'm not sure. Let me try to ping them and see. I'm not used to being the first one on the call. Jenna mentioned her outlook alerting of meetings was not working today. So maybe she's just got her head down in some work. So.
Trevor F: Okay, one.
Scott T: Second, I'll find her. Yeah, she's trying to wrap up with another customer call. So she is not ignoring us. She's trying to wrap up.
Jenna H: Hello?
Ivan S: Sorry for being a few minutes late.
Trevor F: No worries.
Scott T: Jenna just said she was wrapping up another call. So she might be a few minutes. Still. Is there anything you want to cover on the front end of the call here? Or?
Ivan S: I think… it's been a couple weeks since the last time we had our call. I believe the last time was more of just a kickoff. So I think for the agenda for today, we may do a little bit more requirements gathering. And then depending… on how that goes, then we can start going into the value roadmap.
Trevor F: Yeah. Okay.
Scott T: Yeah, I'd really, this is like Jenna's bread and butter, so I would really prefer to wait for her, but typically, we kind of start with kind… of like a show and tell kind of where you see your Domo, instance being successful, what areas you feel like you could maybe use some help from. And if that doesn't kind of spur conversations, then we can kind of go into some other questions and digging around but that's typically, I feel like where we want to start.
Trevor F: Let me take.
Scott T: A look in your instance here, see what we've got?
Trevor F: I know we, I feel like we came out of the last meeting with a list of things. Yeah, yeah, you know, a potential… project. So.
Scott T: Yeah, that's what I need to find. As I mentioned, Jenna is the one that excels… at this part. I'm going to try to find her notes though.
Trevor F: If I.
Scott T: can scoop in.
Trevor F: Yeah.
Jenna H: For a second, I thought we were frozen, Scott, you weren't moving?
Scott T: Yeah, no, I was trying to find, I'm trying to find your notes so I could maybe get started, but you're here now, so.
Jenna H: Glad to be of service. Hi, Trevor. How are you?
Trevor F: Good. How are you? Did you?
Scott T: Get a marker on your face?
Jenna H: Oh, gosh. Oh, I cut myself. Oh.
Scott T: No.
Jenna H: Hold on. I didn't realize it was like that bad. Yeah, it was not a fun. My God. Yeah, okay. Yeah. So I… you distracted me, but.
Scott T: I'm sorry?
Jenna H: That's okay. Sorry, I'm a few minutes late, Trevor. I had another meeting that was running over, but let me no worries.
Trevor F: Pull up.
Jenna H: My notes from last time and we can kind of a, I'd love to kind of just talk about any big changes that have happened… over at cozy earth since we talked last because it has been, it has been a minute since we, we've connected. So, yeah.
Trevor F: I don't think so. I don't think there's been, you know, any crazy changes since the last time we met all.
Jenna H: Right. That's not horrible. I mean, I'm glad it wasn't like major… crises or anything along that nature. Let me, how is, how have things been going for you and your team so far?
Trevor F: Pretty good. You know, we're just getting ready, you know, for Q for, I mean, we've done a lot of, the buying but, you know, just kind of running through some different scenarios, you know, make sure inventory, is all good to go. We're doing a lot of price changing on our website, just trying to find more optimal pricing. So, you know, there's a lot of stuff on that and just trying to analyze what the impact is going to be, you know, forecast out how that's going to affect revenue inventory, all that good stuff now.
Jenna H: Is that stuff that you handle in Domo? Or components of it within Domo? Because I know it's there's a lot of steps in that process.
Trevor F: Yeah, yeah. I mean, a fair amount of it in Domo. You know, one, one thing we look at, we ran a price test, you know, to try to see, you know, what the lift would be if we lowered pricing 10 percent, 20 percent. So we have another platform that kind of does that on the front end. And then, you know, we get the data from that and, you know, we'll look at, you know, based off the orders within each group, you know, what is, what does profitability look like? What does gross margin look like? You know, between those groups and, you know, which one at the end of the day maximizes profit dollars, so that, you know, that those profitability models, you know, live in Domo. So, we utilize Domo in that way, to kind of combine… the information from this other platform with what's sitting in Domo to, you know, try to make more data driven decision there.
Jenna H: Awesome. Yeah, there's definitely a lot of opportunity… like pricing is so complex. I think down the road, getting an understanding of, the processes of your pricing especially when you're trying to take into consideration profit margin and cost and fluctuation. And I think that would be really cool to see how you're doing it. Yeah. Let's talk. I know. Have you engaged with Sim at all recently?
Trevor F: No, I don't think so. Not since the last call.
Jenna H: Okay. There is, how are you in salt lake city or nearby salt lake city?
Trevor F: Yes, I am.

The conversation highlighted the benefits of the Domo-Snowflake partnership, such as improved performance, reduced costs, and simplified data integration, while also addressing Trent's concerns about the implementation process and timeline.","Signe P: hi, Krista.

Signe P: Hey, how are you?
Ken D: Doing well, yourself?
Signe P: Good. Hey, Trent.
Trent P: Hey.
Signe P: So, you can see we have some special friends on the call today.
Trent P: Oh, we got a full house here.
Signe P: Yeah, first thing, Ken, I know that you sent over an email, I don't know if we'll have time to do it on the call, but matt said this is something that he could start working on through email. And then if we need to set up another call, we can, if.
Ken D: That's okay. Sounds good. Yeah, that's perfect for me. Thank you.
Signe P: Yep, perfect. And I know that we have Ryder joining from our side, he's from you guys met him last time, but we can come back to that. I think the most important part is we wanted to get you introduced to Krista and Colin and we've talked to them and had some internal calls about what you guys are looking to do. So, I think the first thing is I just want them to be able to introduce themselves and kind of jump into it. And if you have questions along the way, you can ask, and then I think by then Ryder can be on or matt can talk to you about how that Domo snowflake partnership works and what that looks like in Domo since I don't think you've seen a demo yet? Does that sound good?
Trent P: Yeah, that sounds great. Yeah, we just a little bit more info. Ken and I both attended that webinar yesterday. That was a demo of snowflake but yeah… I don't know if we got all of our answers of how it would work with Domo, right? And so, yeah, just wanted you to be aware.
Krista B: Awesome. No, that's fantastic. My intention there was. I just, I knew we had only 30 minutes for our call today. So I thought maybe ahead of time, seeing just kind of the UI and a basic understanding of snowflake would give you guys a little bit of background context as we kind of chat today. So thanks so much for that update. I'm so glad that you were able to attend background. I am Krista. I mentioned earlier to sign that we don't usually wear these crazy shirts. We had a theme day today for a meeting we're having off site. So I apologize for that, but my name is Krista. I'm the account executive that would work with you all. And then Colin here is my technical counterpart. So he has a lot more of that background knowledge and can kind of answer some of the ins and outs. But essentially, we wanted to talk to you today. I understand that you're using athena, but we'd love to learn, you know, before we jump into it. Of course, we like to keep everything tailored as you may have seen. Snowflake is a quite robust platform with a lot of different functionalities and capabilities. So I think the best way to tailor the conversation today would be what is the most top of mind? What would be most important for you to kind of hear and align with us on?
Trent P: Yeah, I wouldn't say athena is the most important. So, and it might just be like, hey, you guys, let me know what's best, right? Because again, I don't know the snowflake platform all that well. So, but yeah, athena is one, we have one with like half a 1,000,000,000 rows and it climbs by like 100,000 a day right now. So it's climbing up there. But that's… just one part of it. The main part is what me and Ken were talking about after we watched a demo yesterday was we have a lot of different databases. And so for example, and I don't know if this is something that can be helped or not, but it would help us be able to, you know, spend additional money with snowflake if this was something that it ended up working out, right? So right now, we have different databases. We have four different product lines. One of the product lines uses mysql and then we have a read replica and that read replica, we query pretty heavily because so we have complex queries because we didn't want it to affect production. And so one thing I was thinking about was, I wonder if this could be something where we have that data from the production database going to snowflake, and then we use snowflake's computation. Obviously, we'll still have some sort of performance, some sort of, you know, it won't fully be optimized because we still have to bring that data in somehow, right? But it's not going to be these complex queries. So I don't know really what that toll would be, but it is of interest. The other product lines, we have a postgres, we have another one that has three or maybe even, I think three or maybe even four now SQL servers. And then we have another product line that has five. So we have a lot of these databases that we're having to pull data from. And we're also looking at combining all these databases into like a more universal app per SE across all of our product lines. And so there's a lot of moving pieces. But right now that's kind of where it stands. And we didn't want to go and get so, like right now just something we suffered from. I guess it would be last week, we had one of our analysts do a query that degraded production on the safety reports business. And so we then talked about, hey, what should we do? Should we get a read replica up? So this way it doesn't happen again or how should we go about this? We need visibility into what our queries are. Doing performance wise and such. And when we looked at the cost we're like, okay, yeah, the cost of bringing up a whole replica doesn't exactly make sense for how little we're actually ",Consumption Pricing Model,40000.979999999996,Corporate,BUSYBUSY.COM,9,High Tech,110,$10M to <$25M,Upsell,Blank,4: Confirm Solution,Signe Pastran,2025-12-08,2025-08-05,2025-08-06,2025-08-18,2025-08-18,,,,0013800001BYTzfAAH

And what we're waiting for is more structural or when the new CIO comes in, there's a chance for changing our ERP system. And with that, we could be changing our from over from Hubspot to something that's a Microsoft product or something. So, like there's a lot of ifs on what does our tech stack look like?

Scott T: Well, they'll learn, give it a year or two Spencer.
Spencer M: I'm in the crummy level.
Jenna H: So. Okay. So, with like that piece, I guess, for the business goals. Does apex like have a strategic plan or any type of goals? Like right now, would it necessarily be determined by a new CIO or is like everything just like up?
Spencer M: In the air… it's a good question. And I think that's why we need to get… I don't know if Kyle's the right person that can know those things. And I don't think we have that identified of like who do we want to get in those calls? Okay? And I, from what makes sense for me is that since I'm the main point of contact for Domo, it's like there's nobody that is the executive sponsorship level in Domo right now, that went out the way when we lost Jim, who was our CIO, and so, it's until we know who our true executive sponsor is, then we know what the vision for our bi tool system is, and then is it to be facilitate the organization as a whole or is it to do more piecemeal reporting as needed? Like there isn't a true vision of how does the software get implemented without somebody directing the ship or just here? And so, in order to know like, hey, how do we facilitate the growth? Is it… I don't know that's super hard and I think I'd like to say that there's some goals, but right now, we're mostly just… treading water. So, I think if you want we can, I can, we can see if we can get just some time with just Kyle and see if you can just get, that might help a little bit more. But I honestly don't know if Kyle's the person that knows, because like Kyle's still only one level up from me in the IP department. He's.
Jenna H: yeah. Do you know if Kyle was around when Domo was implemented?
Spencer M: Yeah. Kyle's, been with apex for like over a decade, okay?
Jenna H: I think… so here's kind of what I'm thinking is the… overall big picture stuff. We may not be able to necessarily incorporate all of that, right? But what I think could be beneficial is like having a single like one hour session with Kyle where we can ask about, how Domo was implemented, if he was there. Like were there any major challenges? What was the game plan? Did people receive it well right out of the gate? What worked? What didn't work? Because that helps give us insight into like how can we approach this new project? Like if we learned, last time, like when it was implemented, that people just don't know where to go, don't know what to do, don't know what Domo was capable of, then, you know, we can change our, I,
Spencer M: think, I think that's some of it is that, let's just, I'll give you a quick background for Kyle, is that Kyle has was hired on as senior network engineer and infrastructure solution engineer. And so, the reason he's in the role he's in right now is because he's the only person in the company that knows the long term where our data's been stored and lived and what those queries look like, as opposed to like he's not a true person that's in the analytics realm. So, he's a very pipeline centered person. He… was tasked to lead the team just because he had the background knowledge of the company, but maybe not necessarily like business driven goals. And so we don't have that person that's the true oversight of how information gets stored down. So that fits into your piece a little bit. Is that I don't know if we have that person identified and each department has a small picture of what they need to get done. But it's not like a true here's. Our KPIs for the year here's the key things. I don't know if there's a true like OKR style structure.
Jenna H: OK, because I think if we talk with Kyle and get some information about the implementation",Consumption Pricing Model,364855.2,Corporate,APEXCOS.COM,6,Professional Services,1069,$250M to <$500M,Upsell,Blank,5: Negotiations,Jake Ward,2025-12-15,2025-09-16,2025-09-16,2025-09-16,2025-09-16,2025-09-16,,,0015000000uKzrqAAC

Michael T: Toronto is in ontario, but kingsville is four hours.
Simeon N: Away. Okay. So you're about four hours out. All right.

So it's Domo's user event that we host in March. Normally pretty fun. We had what normally there's like musical performance like last year, we had the styx and T pain like couldn't have two different opposite, you know, types of artists performing. But yeah, normally, it's just a good week to get to network with other Domo customers. And now I think we had, are you guys connected to moochie farms at all? Do you know any of the people over there?
Michael T: Yeah, we know some of them, okay?
Simeon N: Yeah. So they're also a customer of ours and I get to work that account as well and they've come up a couple of times. So I think Jenna just, yeah, it looks like she just put a link in the chat, but that's Domo palooza. Lots of fun. I'm sure you'll get more emails in the future about it.
Scott T: Connections to her. She sent the connections to her.
Simeon N: Oh, that's the connections to her. Okay? We.
Jenna H: haven't, we have a stop in Toronto next month where it's a free half day event where you can register for a technical working session, but they also have some speakers so you could meet like other Domo clients from the area and share how different people are using Domo. This tour is really focused around data and AI, which could be, really interesting. There's. Also going to be some Domo executives at your stop. There is matt mecham. Who is the vice president of our department for operations at Domo. So he'll be speaking. Typically, there's one or two local customers that will also be speaking in like a fireside chat and a lot of our partners also attend. And so it's just really a great opportunity for some face time with different folks from Domo. Our partners see what other people are doing, network, eat some good food usually.

Scott T: They're like an hour, maybe they're close, not.
John D: Even.
Scott T: Not even, yeah.
Simeon N: Seriously. Yeah. Scott and I both. So, Scott's based in Chicago and I've got Chicago roots. So, normally, I don't talk fondly of Detroit. I don't.
Michael T: speak.
Simeon N: Fondly of them, but hey, if it gets us closer to you guys, I guess we can do that.
Mat W: Yeah.
John D: We're a border city, so we're pretty close. Okay, I live in Windsor, which is like 30 minutes away from where we work, but very close to Detroit.
Simeon N: Yeah, sweet. Yeah, that's good to know. That makes it a lot easier. I think… I've got some relatives that live. I want to say they're in ontario and my wife forever has been wanting to go out and see them. It's just, we've got like a two year old and a six month old, and I'm like that sounds awful.

Matt M: Hey, Dan.
Dan H: Good to see you guys. Yeah.
Matt M: Haven't seen you in a few two years. I think maybe I don't know if you remember us, but I do remember your name. Yeah, it's been a few years.
Dan H: Yeah, man, it's been a minute, but I know that I'm not great with names, but I do remember falvey.
Matt M: That works. That's good.
Dan H: So, you… guys have got, and I'm sorry, I'm just jumping right into it because I do have a hard stop. You guys have got, what are we trying to do with the Mongo data?
Matt M: Well, we're trying to do a whole bunch of stuff with it.
Eric M: Yeah. So we have a new I'll just do it quick. Yeah, go for it. We're going to a new product line that has a much higher scale of data, right? So it's we're trying to it's like transaction, imagine, you know, we do shippers insurance, imagine transactional parcels. So like when you buy something on Amazon, you get a little checkbox that says, I'm going to insure this shipment, right? So we're trying to make sure that our internal architecture is scalable up to like a 1,000,000,000 transactions per year. Okay? That's a very different, you know, in over the next several years, right? Not not at the gate, but that's caused us to say, okay, let's rebuild our apis. Let's go from a SQL database to a nosql Mongo. And, and really, this is just a forward looking how best can we manage the data, and get it back into doma to keep working through there. So, we've been actively developing a new database for the last two months or so. Okay, probably not going to see production use for another month. And this, the volume in the beginning is not going to be, you know, we're going to try and roll it out as a pilot and then, you know, get more and more clients on this new product line over the years. So that's kind of where we're looking, it's a big it's all in the name of building scalability and capacity, of our databases.
Dan H: Got it. So, we've got connectors for Mongo, right? I'm sure you guys have seen that… obviously, well, maybe not obviously, but part of what our connectors jobs do and I think you guys recognize this is, they parse the data from whatever format it's in to a tabular structure, and they put it in the data store in Domo. Sometimes that works out better than others, right? It all depends on how that data is structured. You can end up with a whole bunch of cartesian products. If you have a whole bunch of, you know, many to many relationships inside of a document, for example, so is your intent to like, do you want that data in a tabular structure in Domo? So you can build cards on it? Or do you want to leave that data unstructured in its document format inside of Mongo? And then, you know, do some sort of vector searches across it for knowledge basis, like what's the end goal with the data?
Eric M: Yeah, it's a good question. I'm leaning towards I'm… leaning towards where we're trying to structure it, but that might be a.
Matt M: Limiting factor.
Eric M: Yeah, it might be one of these things where I mean we're basically confronting the core problem of why people go to Mongo unstructured databases in the first place where our, and just to visualize it, we have these nested relationships where like, and going back to an Amazon example, you buy 10 things in one purchase on Amazon that is then shipped to you in two different shipments. Yeah, shipment that has its own products, right? Yep. So you really have this kind of three dimensional object where, yeah. So in our preliminary tests of this style, what we get is like a incremental column that says like product one, you know, shipment one product one, and then another field that says shipment two product one. And, you know, if we were really trying to just process it the way that we always have, we would try and do some sort of column name operation to look for all sequences because it's making the sequence as it's necessary for the data it's trying to pull in. But doing that type of logic on column names feels a little funky, right? Like it's a little bit, but I, you know, it's basically a loop within where we're trying to, if you visualize that structure, we're trying to sum total value of goods on a purchase order and it's then broken into these two rectangles and all that kind of stuff. So we started with the idea of okay, you know, how can we make this into a tabular format? But that just might be an older way of thinking about things and we really, you know, want to do something differently.
Dan H: Well, one way that you could handle it is to pull, let's say that you pull those two, you pull, you create one data set in Domo that's tabular, that's your shipments. And you create another data set in Domo that's your products right? And they each have the correlated ids. And then when you do want to marry them together, you can choose which side you want to aggregate or kind of how you want to handle that. That's a common way that I've seen that I've seen things like that. Done the thing is in order to, in order to build parts in Domo, we're going to need to structure it, right? That's just the way that the visualization engine works. So it really just comes down to knowing all the relationships that exist in those documents. You know, how do we want to do that? And it could very well be if you've got two or three which is what we see a lot of times, sometimes it's way more like many to many relationships, bring them in individually. And then you can relate them in views or however you want to inside of Domo.
Matt M: So, Dan, just two preliminary if you don't mind, just two preliminary thoughts. Maybe this will help. We really have two minds. Initially. One was exactly what you're suggesting. Hey, let's just bring in the separate pieces, the separable pieces, you know, in a tabular structure, we'll do the etls, we'll join it. That way. The thing is over time, there's going to be a lot of records to bring in and to process. So that really that'll really start to affect, you know, our overall credit. So that's why we're thinking option one, option two is can we be clever before it gets ",Consumption Pricing Model,273436.8,Corporate,FALVEYINSURANCEGROUP.COM,11,Insurance,80,$10M to <$25M,Upsell,Blank,Closed Won,Jeff Humble,2025-08-12,2025-06-26,2025-08-12,2025-08-12,2025-08-12,2025-08-12,2025-08-12,,0013000000DXZ1fAAH

That's good for him. I know he's been doing a lot of work with Domo, so it's good to see. He's getting some credit for it from within the company yeah.
Phil S: Exactly. And this one, as you'll see from the numbers here, I think can be, you know, really even bigger. So I see we've got Scott on now as well. He's got. You guys hear me? Okay, I got you now. Hey, hey, hope everybody's having a good Friday. Yes, happy Friday. Well… yeah, we can kind of hop in. So, Scott, I think you weren't on our last call but we had met Mike hoyle, you know, really excited, you know, to have him on board with the team, as the senior director and he had a lot of really good questions, right? I think it was one where on the Domo side, you know, we did, he brought up a lot of good points of like, you know, other homework that we really need to do and something, you know, you guys all heard me probably ask so many questions about it too while we were on site. It's a difficult as far as the task of what we'd be building, right? Because it's not like, hey, this is all being done in flex today or anything like a lot of it is being done in email or, you know, being done in excel, but how do we really quantify and justify, you know, paying for something like this, right? Like we really need to put that into solid dollar terms. So I took, you know, took that feedback, and really on our side like worked with that, to build out, you know, a full calculator here. And this again is a custom app like built inside of Domo… that just to show you the power of Domo is something I built myself like in a day, you know, leveraging some AI tools but I'll just kind of walk through it and then please not married to anything on here. Would love to get your, you know, feedback and then kind of make this your own, right? Because I think that'll be where the Roi becomes the most legitimate, right? Is, you know, if it's based on like real life inputs from you guys as well. So I'll kind of start with, you know, the calculations are pretty self explanatory, right of like the actual Roi but I've also tried to just put in like some of the key inputs because some of these we're not really going to be able to, you know, put into value, but, you know, they're important points like, you know, Jeff, you know, during our call last week, you brought up like, hey, this helps us establish benchmarks, you know, around PPT data that we can't currently do today. That's something that's not really going to show up in like Roi calculations. But if you have feedback, I'm like, hey, you know, that that's going to impact this dollar budget or something in some way, but. For Mike's point, I wanted to, you know, just at least kind of call some of those out, right? Some of the other areas like eliminating the Jeff, you brought this up as well eliminates the ability for SPS to enter invalid data, right? Something your team is dealing with. Like I think that does kind of probably go into the calculations around like time saved, but that's also just going to have downstream impacts on like the overall, you know, quality of the data as well. So, the way this is designed… is that every time that I make an update as far as like actual figures, all of these calculations are going to update. So I've tried to separate this out into like hard cost savings, time and productivity growth and capacity and then provide within the tool like the overall project cost of the pricing that we provided you guys. So I'll start with like hard cost savings. So like limsey, you know, that one's pretty easy. We know that costs 38,000. But if you do learn new information or if you know, Bryce, you get feedback that, hey, this is actually maybe we're gonna keep Lindsay for this reason or that, right? You can just update this into zero, right? And that's gonna automatically update our calculations and all of like the figures here, right? And, this figure here is going to change to zero, you know, for any of these savings sample budget, this one is a hard cost because the idea is that if we're communicating, you know, and streamlining that process a lot we might not, you know, need as many samples. So, Bryce, like the figure I was thinking here, I just used the number of like a 1,000,000 for like one of our annual sample budget is. But is that something you guys happen to know a specific figure around or even like, you know, a guesstimate on what that could be? I.
Brice W: Guess when you're talking samples, are we talking… samples for the onboarding process or are we talking samples for internal testing that we use to do benchmarks and comparative testing and stuff?
Phil S: I guess both or which one would you say is more relevant to because I think in our conversation, Bryce, where we were debriefing, we were talking about, well, you know, but for, if we had the solution more formalized, we probably wouldn't need as many samples. So I don't know which category that would fall into.
Brice W: I think it might… I don't know. I, I'm trying to think of ways that we would have like through testing, we'd have to submit less samples for onboarding… because the testing is the testing, how we do it. It might be more on like the comparative testing and benchmarking, maybe, yeah.
Phil S: Of like we're testing with the current process and maybe we, so anyway, I can let you guys kind of think about that. But even if we decide, hey sample budget, all right, that's not going to be, you know, we can mark this but it's designed to be like, all right, if home depot's spending, you know, 20,000,000 dollars on sample budget, you can drag and drop this of like how much do we actually think that's going to reduce? And again, this will update our calculations. So what I wanted this to be able to do is for you to just completely make it your own, right? It's like you guys are, you know, if you put this in front of Mike Bryce and you're having a conversation with him, it's like sample budget's not going to do this. It's only going to be seven percent. Okay. Like let's look at that, right?

Sharr J: Thanks. Good morning. Thanks for being available last minute.
Simon N: No problem. I had someone cancel and it worked out.
Sharr J: Is Michelle available?
Simon N: Yeah, she should be able to hop on. She accepted it. I know she's also in back to backs today, so might just be a minute or two. How was the long weekend?
Sharr J: It was great. You?
Simon N: It was great. Yes, stuck around in bend and a little mountain biking, a little hiking, had some friends in town. Yeah, it was a lot of fun.
Sharr J: Nice. I was, well, it was a good weekend, but I was in school through Friday through Sunday. I got home late Sunday night, but Monday was nice, just time with the family around here.
Simon N: School for what?
Sharr J: I made an mba program.
Simon N: Oh, nice.
Sharr J: In an executive format. So, it's, 20… weekends.
Simon N: Wow six.
Sharr J: Full weeks and then there's, zoom based coursework mixed in.
Simon N: That's a big commitment actually. I.
Sharr J: Was I, this? I didn't even notice my zoom account was connected to, this is my school background. I didn't realize. I didn't realize that it is graphed and connected with that. Hey, Michelle.
Meshell R: Hey, how are you Jonathan?
Sharr J: Doing well. How are you?
Meshell R: Good to see you.
Sharr J: Good to see you too. I really appreciate, the last minute. So I'll jump right into it, and then you'll understand why the last minute before two. So at two, we are meeting with the, I want to make sure I call them correctly, like your internal consulting arm.
Simon N: Yep. Our, our adoption team.
Sharr J: Right. And, I have to say just to not be overly gratuitous I, I've been, as we've chatted with them. I've been really like thrilled, a lot of good ideas and a lot of good places to add value to where I was getting with the point. I'm like, oh, okay. Like, this makes a lot of sense. I feel really confident pushing back on Jeff and Todd and saying like, look, there is there's room in the toolbox, for multiple tools, and I think that might be smart of us. So, so the terrible news that's like the good news, the terrible news is, I don't know if you saw, not that you would, because I'm sure your clients are across multiple verticals. I don't know if you saw the press release this morning, but the large equity owners of Alaris life are selling, are chunking up and selling the company. So, by the end of the calendar year, we most likely won't even exist as a going concern… which is bad for all the, for all the obvious reasons. But really what I wanted to say is one, I wanted to tell you two first and get your gauge of how to tell the team this, you know, in an hour this afternoon. And obviously, as much as I would be thrilled to continue going through with that, I imagine these are not cheap Domo team members and I don't want to like waste your time and money on a project for an organization that, you know, let's say they move fast. Maybe it gets like a few weeks or a month using the really cool content.
Simon N: Yeah, maybe. And I appreciate kind of the transparency and just the heads up on this. I did not see, looks like, so they're winding down operations of Alaris life. Is that lele, I guess maybe talk to us a little bit more about what, you know, in the short amount of time this has been public about what this means. Just, I mean, also like for your role, like are, does that mean that you're looking at other opportunities and odds in a bounce or kind of what do you know about this?
Sharr J: Oh, yeah. I can, well, now, I can now, I can, yesterday was like a weird day. Just everyone in the organization knowing would not, you know, I wanted to start reaching out to vendors immediately. So anyway, the… yeah, the entire home office corporate will be completely wound down. So, everyone in corporate has been told like, you know, in approximately 60 days you won't have a job. And that includes Todd, you know, Jeff, yeah, but, you know, Jeff will be okay, Jeff, my guess is Jeff… my guess we'll find another leadership role within one… of the parent companies. But anyway, yeah. So no one, my… team, Todd, all of Todd's directs and indirects, everybody.
Meshell R: I was just going to ask, are you going to be okay?
Sharr J: I'll be okay. Thank you. I, that's so like, so… so nice of you to say that. Yeah, I certainly hope so, I have confidence. So, the, you know, networking will commence immediately.
Meshell R: Yeah.
Sharr J: If you have client clients who are in need of data leaders… I will make sure we're connected on LinkedIn. Yeah, for sure. I bring a tremendous amount to the table. I think I have a very unique and good approach combining both the business and the technical which is sometimes rare amongst data professionals. So, yeah. So there will, so so that's the answer to your question, Simon is yes. And they, not that this necessarily matters but, you know, that timeline's a little up in the air. You know, the 60 days was based on federal and state rules of what you have to give for notice. I just, you know, it's actually telling, you know, I think you've, met some members on my team, but I was talking to them earlier like I just, no one knows that may be spot on, right? We may have everything wrapped up and we're all ready to go at the beginning of November or, you know, they may need some people to stay on because it's strange where… it's like all status quo. You know, if you think of the way this business is, it's not unlike a hospitality business, right? Where you've got your individual communities that… are going to continue. They're just going to have new owners. So we have to support those communities and all of the content, you know, from just from my wheelhouse from a business intelligence perspective, ensure… they have everything they need. And then, you know, a new owner will just take over operations. Sorry. I'm rambling. Does that all?

They explored potential solutions, such as only pulling in the last 10 days of data and adding a partition to the output to help manage the row count, in order to improve the performance of the ETL process and ensure the production data is updated on the dashboard more frequently.","James H: hey, Zach.
Zachary O: Hey.
James H: How you been?
Zachary O: All good.
James H: Good, good. I don't think we have a whole lot. I know there were a couple of tickets that were sent out over the last couple of weeks or whatever. I don't know if we want to try to go over some of those and whatnot.
Zachary O: just on them up right now. There it is. So, I've… got three open. Okay? So, the one with the views that went to engineering, they are working on it right now. What appears to be happening is that it's trying to generate a schema, but that scheme is not being recorded. So that is with them and they're trying to figure out if it's because we're using timestamp with… a filter or what's happening with that. But this is something that is with engineering. It's 30,000,000 rows. So we shouldn't be hitting it that hard. But again, that's where I am with that powerpoint, the… powerpoint case. We're currently investigating it. I'm going to be communicating with Allison just to get a little bit more clarity because Chris on our add ins team was asking about the… slide ids they've changed and they're trying to, he's, trying to see what happened. Like, was there, were there any edits to the file… that's because we're looking at the slides and we're going, we can't do a refresh all and we can't do a refresh by part. It's so it's that's where we are. So Allison's getting an email today. And then the other one from Samir… we did go into it and dataflow runs. There were, was an issue. They, did have an issue with the dataflow runs and that has come back down to two to three minutes.
James H: Yeah, the, with the dataflow runs that you were looking at because I saw your message backed up on, that, was that looking at the source of that view or because I guess what I was curious about is like, he, I think he sent over, an additional email that I asked him to send because he, needed to manually run it because we got a notification from data watchdog that our dataset hadn't updated in over 60 minutes. And, so he went in and looked, I think that was a little bit of a timing thing as well. But, he did a manual run and that ETL, the rng, production minute dataflow for him on his manual run ran in seven minutes, and then it proceeded on the, like, scheduled runs to take like 20 minutes. Again. So, I was just curious like, what the two to three minute one was because we haven't seen it on the ETL that sources like, I think the view that we were going for, but I don't remember all the specifics of like what all he initially put in. But yeah, I didn't know what the two to three minutes was specifically associated to.
Zachary O: Well, I'm, just bringing it up right now, So I'm looking at production minute. I'm looking for production minute data flow, and I'm not seeing it as a data, set. I'm not sure if we've changed things, like the naming, structure.
James H: Yeah. I'll show you, his screenshot again. I'll put it like in this chat. I don't think, yeah, it doesn't, this one doesn't have like the, URL on it. So, like, it don't have the id. Can I paste, a picture in this chat? I don't think I can.
Zachary O: Oh… never mind. Got it. I got the data flow. Okay. So, I'm looking at it, yeah, we're showing 20 minutes,
James H: Yeah, and I don't remember like exactly what he sent over on the first time. But basically, I think around, this was technically before that week of the 20 first, where you said that there were some issues where we saw a bunch of data flows get hung. But I think maybe around the fourteenth or something, this ETL had consistently ran in like five minutes now, granted, Samir kind of did something, we don't really want him to do. Going forward, he put a test, component inside of this production ETL that like basically doubled the output because he was trying to test a formula, but, he ended up getting rid of that last week, but it was running in five minutes even with that test in there. And then like randomly, it just jumped to start running in 20 minutes and it's been basically consistently 20 minutes. I haven't looked at it today, but, that's that was one thing that we were curious about. I don't know if there was something that you guys might be able to investigate on the back end to see like maybe what, could have like slowed it down. But we're mostly just curious. We know there's things on our side that we can change to try to improve the speed. But mostly, we're curious because it was running with basically the current setup a lot faster. Now, granted, we've been increasing the size of it over time, but it should only be like somewhat like marginally every day because I don't know how many sites we have on there, but maybe like 20 that are pushing data into it, that are updating like 1,440 records a day. So, but… yeah, so I don't know, it just, it was a big spike.
Zachary O: Yeah, I'm see, I'm, looking at the manual run, it's running seven minutes. I, when I'm looking over this, see, I can only go back to the twentieth and those are 20 minute runs. There are some that are cutting back to 16.
James H: Yeah.
Zachary O: But… I take your point of, we want this to be effective. The, the one thing that I am, looking at is we're slowly inching up on both input and output, just looking at prior. We're adding, about a, about a gig a week? Okay? In data. Yeah. Now, again, that shouldn't be extreme… but at the same time, I'm looking at that going, I honestly, I'm probably going to go and take this, to our engineering team and that's… so, I'm, looking at, version 30 is the one that was on the fourteenth that was running at six minutes. Huh. Now, looking at status, there… was an issue on the fifteenth, data flow delays that were, that we had to fix.
James H: Huh.
Zachary O: And so that's the fourteenth fifteenth. That was, the issue that, I mentioned in my email to Samir?
James H: Huh.
Zachary O: Since… then. I would bet that they… I would bet that they implemented, something, let… me take a look at our release schedule too. I want to make sure I'm not speaking out my rear, and then next week we had our release.

Jason J: That's fine. I'm playing with dbq data preparation. Okay. Trying to figure it out.
Benjamin P: How's your week going? Congratulations on the associate of the month award that you got. That was exciting news.
Jason J: Yeah, thanks. I mean, I still haven't gotten anything like literally no plaque or anything. I just get to say it. I guess, I don't know but I appreciate it.
Benjamin P: What are you thinking of your Cleveland browns?
Jason J: It's exactly what I thought. I mean, their defense is, really legit. Yeah, everything else from there is a coin toss.
Benjamin P: Yeah. Well, they were saying… last week before the game against green bay, they said that green bay has not played against the defense like Cleveland's yet. And so they were right. They were right because that was a good win for them. I actually drafted in the final round of our fantasy football. I don't know if you do fantasy football, but on the final round of our fantasy football?
Jason J: Draft, not now.
Benjamin P: On the final round, I drafted Sean judkins and for some reason, for… some reason, I was stupid enough to drop him the next day before the season started because I don't know why I did that. I was like, well, maybe I don't know if he's going to start. And so I dropped him and somebody else picked him up and I'm regretting it now. I'm kicking myself because I should have kept him but I didn't he's played well. He's played very well.
Jason J: Yeah. And he's had no practice time. Just wait. I mean, that's the only thing that can unlock this offense. It's like we need the running game to be able to get the downfield passing. If we're keeping with lack of, I mean, that's just it.
Benjamin P: Well, so I have, I've spent some time, with the ML pricing data set. I do want to spend a little more time today with you and talk to you a little bit more. I'm waiting on engineering to get jupyter workspaces working in the salvage demo instance because they're not working right now. And so, I'm going to need access to jupyter workspaces to do the analysis and the models that I'm wanting to build. And so they are working on that.
Jason J: Side comment on that one that may have something to do with azure that you're going to run into because we're on azure, but we are like Phil and I are like looking in probably pretty close to moving into the GCP. Yeah. So that might be the answer to it.
Benjamin P: Yeah. Well, jupyter is available in azure because I've worked with another enterprise customer who we used jupyter workspaces but I do think it's we don't have very many customers who use jupyter on azure. And so, I think it's something that they have to map on the back end to make it work. But they are working on that. I expect an update today. And then I know it's available on GCP as well, so I can go ahead and get started in the instance that we're in. And when it switches over, it shouldn't be a problem. We should be able to continue using the same workspaces.
Jason J: I was just trying to, save you looking for problems that maybe don't need answered in a week or two. Yeah.
Benjamin P: Well, yeah. I'm excited to dig in. I've got some more. I've got a lot more capacity now from starting, you know, on Monday for the next several weeks that this is going to be one of my primary things that I'll be working on and so expect to hear from me often over the next couple.
Jason J: Weeks as.
Benjamin P: I work through this.
Jason J: I'm doing the same thing on other stuff. So I've been pretty engaged. So I've been around like I said, we ran into that problem where it's like I couldn't parse through that 10,000,000,000 record table. So I'm trying to do that piece in gbq which I'm getting there. And then I'll pull that into Domo. So that's all what I've been working on, but I found more hidden money while I did that too. So we're… already making more money than we were yesterday.
Benjamin P: Find me some hidden money, Jason, dude?
Jason J: It's not coming to me either, so don't really don't feel bad. I mean, it's like, you know, can you break me off a little piece?
Benjamin P: Oh, all right. So I am getting logged in. So last time we spoke there's really ML… pricing. Okay. ML, pricing data is the data set that we are using… right here, correct?
Jason J: Yeah.
Benjamin P: And our primary objectives are really two things, right? It's number one determine where… to list and the… options are marketplace… option. And those are the only two that we're really focused.
Jason J: On right now, no consignment too.
Benjamin P: Consignment, do we?
Jason J: Want? Like basically, if it's like undesirable, we can ship it to consignment. So, like if it's the, if it's something that we don't think is going to return… a good return or like there, there's other things like blinds, okay, blinds will probably never, we… don't want to do anything with them. They're probably going to say, hey, send needs to consignment type thing. So.
Benjamin P: Okay.
Jason J: And if you want to order those based on like, where are, like how recovery it would be auction would be one marketplace, two consignment, three in the list of, I guess desirability based on what the number?
Benjamin P: One would be marketplace you said?
Jason J: No auction?
Benjamin P: Oh, auction.
Jason J: Yeah.
Benjamin P: All right. And three would be consignment. So, you get more money when something goes to auction.
Jason J: Typically, but that's the thing not always that's what we've got. We need to start figuring out.
Benjamin P: So… in this data set, when I'm looking at this data set, this is a combination of items that have historical… SPS that have sold in addition to SPS… that have… been listed, but haven't sold yet.
Jason J: Good question. Let me look real quick.
Benjamin P: Like, is this just historical sales or does this thing? I think?
Jason J: That might be historical sales… but I'll let you know in a second. Wherever I can get there. It's attacking me because they're like Dan just sent me something.

Shelly V: Ray should be joining in a minute. Let me ping him real quick. So, while we wait for Ray, I know one topic that came up at least with the governance committee, we had talked about kind of creating our dictionary for AI, but we're worried about our credit consumption there. And so I kind of wanted to talk through that… the credit consumption, how much it costs and make a determination on when we will implement the AI functionality. Do you guys have that info? Yeah.
Kevin W: We're just rolling it out. There's one credit burn for every five questions.
Shelly V: Okay. So, I will have to decide like for example, Mamta… we talked about this. I was kind of thinking, okay, I want to see shipment details. And so, I would hate for somebody to go to AI and say, give me all the shipment details for X shipment, right? And burn a whole bunch of credits when we can just add a filter for them to look up the shipment number. So, I got to make that determination and make things readily available. So they don't start asking questions where they could get in. I don't know how to limit. Is there a way to limit the AI?
Kevin W: Yeah.
Shelly V: There is, okay. That would be my concern is, you know, them asking questions that can be found within the dashboard and kind of burning up our credits.
Kevin W: Yeah, you can limit who gets access to it and.
Shelly V: Got it. Okay.
Kevin W: Yeah, I would lean on Braxton, a bit,
Shelly V: Okay. Got it. Yeah. So, yeah, we've been talking quite a bit. We didn't kind of factor that into our credit consumption this year. And so, we need to have that discussion for our future contract. I think. Right, right. Thanks for joining. I was just kind of talking through credit consumption when it pertains to AI, just so we can make some decisions there. Okay? So it's just for your information, it's one credit for every five questions. So, I'm not sure yet that we want to build out that data dictionary. I think we're better focused on other things right now. And then I'll make some decisions from my standpoint on the AI piece.
Raymond A: Okay.
Shelly V: Yeah. Okay. So, I don't know if you had anything that was kind of my topic for today.
Raymond A: I don't. oh, Brian, actually… so the issue with that variable card for the filter, HC, filter thing or the I'm saying not the HC, the yeah, that variable card. So I brought that up to Kyle and opened a ticket. And apparently, what we did at some point probably… when we were replicating the healthcare tab, we made the changes in prod. And so as I understood it, if you make a change in prod, then when you promote from uat, it will just write over whatever you did in prod. But apparently that card doesn't behave that way. So since we changed something in prod, when I promoted from uat, it created this weird block where it says, well, prod is designed this way and you're trying to promote from uat where it's this other way. And instead of it overwriting what was in prod, it just gave that error and it wouldn't take what we did in uat and apply it to prod. And so now when we promote, we get all green lights, it's you know, we no longer get the if you're talking, you're muted?
Brian F: Sorry. Well, I was going to say something, but so… we originally… did that because… it wasn't when we first tried to push from dev to prod control… variable control was giving us an issue.
Raymond A: Yeah.
Brian F: The way we fixed it was we just create recreated it in prod. So, and now what they're saying is you're saying that support is saying because we created that in prod. That now when you try to push it from dev to prod, sandbox is saying, but it's already there. Is that what you're saying?
Raymond A: It's already there, but it's also different in some way. I don't know how it's different from uat, but it's the prod version is different from uat. So when uat is trying to push the uat version to prod, it says, no, no, no, you created it this way in prod. We can't use what you did in uat, we're keeping this and it flags an error which is strange because I always thought uat was always going to just overwrite whatever's in prod. But for whatever reason, the variable control won't behave that way. Everything else. Does the cards?
Brian F: Yeah, Mamta, is this new information… for you? Or did you know this when?
Raymond A: We.
Brian F: in terms of like how sandbox does not override prod for variable controls, apparently no.
Mamta B: So, it does override, but if it breaks, then it does not override. So there is something weird there. So that's something we'll have to for sure raise a support ticket and get that.
Raymond A: So, what I… did was I just completely removed… the variable control from prod and then re promoted uat and that somehow fixed it.
Shelly V: It.
Raymond A: was weird, right? It makes.
Brian F: sense given what you were told. I think what doesn't make sense to me is when we first tried to do it, that variable control was giving us issues and that's why we did what we did. It's working and I guess we'll just move on with our lives.
Raymond A: Yeah.
Mamta B: Yeah, but if you get that issue again, I would highly advise let's get a ticket created. And if nothing is critically important, like we have to push something to life today, I would like the engineers to get that fixed, right? Because you've seen that a couple of times now.
Raymond A: Yeah… but yeah, we're all good now. It was just a strange… little glitch, I guess. But yeah… I didn't have anything else. I still need to get back on that form that Mamta helped me with, but I have so much going on right now. I'm not sure that I'm going to be able to get to it this week and we're going to start naf next week. So I'll definitely have more for next week.
Shelly V: I would agree Ray, that's going to be an enhancement. So I would say let's table that and move to naf. So, let's table AI and… also the form for now. Yeah. So.

They also covered updates on the Germany dashboard, the German homepage, and the upcoming meetings with Italy, as well as the plan to start the product development process after the ESCRS meeting, with Robert from Domo leading the setup.","Simon N: hey, Sarah. How's it going?
Sarah C: Good. How are you?
Simon N: I am doing pretty good. Looking forward to the long weekend.
Sarah C: Yes.
Simon N: Do you have anything fun planned for the extra day?
Sarah C: Not really for the extra day. We're just gonna, it's the, my nephews are playing their first football game on Friday night, so we'll go see that. So they're both on varsity, so that'll be fun.
Simon N: Very fun season opener, Friday night lights.
Sarah C: Yeah. So it'll be a good time.
Simon N: And what do they say everywhere else? It's just football in Texas. It's something else or what is the saying like that, right?
Sarah C: Something like that. Yeah, it's a big, it's a big deal. Everything gets put on hold until that for sure.
Simon N: Oh, that'll be a lot of fun wishing them luck before we dive in today. Any additional questions or feedback on the renewal options?
Sarah C: No, I'm learning a little bit more about some of the integration of Salesforce. Like I found out Germany will be completely on Salesforce before the end of the year, which was new to me. So I kind of probably need to get a sense of what all of that is going to entail in order to kind of like pick which package because if we have a lot of credit or however that's called, where they push through, then… we're going to have to, you know, probably buy the upper package. So, because I mean, Germany is rolling out now and then once Salesforce is in place, we'll make the connection. So that could potentially be our first one. And along with Canada. So, but I need to kind of probably understand the full scope of Salesforce rollout before we make a decision.
Simon N: Okay. Sounds good. Keep me posted on that.
Sarah C: Sure. All right.
Jaran P: And the idea to get the actual revenue information from Salesforce?
Sarah C: Well, I think just probably the input. So what's going to be in the input form will probably just transfer into Salesforce and run through the dashboard. I'm thinking. So if all of the input pieces are currently in Salesforce, at least like volumes cost of patient conversion rate, all of that kind of stuff. I'm thinking it's going to automatically import into the dashboard and we'll skip the input form stage.
Jaran P: Oh, I see. Okay, cool. Yeah, ideally. Yeah.
Sarah C: Yeah.
Jaran P: Well, yeah, I'm sure we can figure out something.
Sarah C: Right. And I mean, but like I told him, I go, y'all might have Salesforce by, you know, towards the end of the year, which is fantastic. But number one is the data all going to be populated and is the data correct for each account. So, and I told him I go, it's only as good as the data that you have in Salesforce. And so you need to consider that before we make the transition exactly. And the head of Europe was like, yeah, you're right? And I was like, so I mean, we want to do this for you. We'll make everything's everybody's life's better, but I don't want you guys to be, you know, running false reports either and presenting them to doctors. So I think there's just like I'll probably learn more in the next couple of weeks while I'm with all of them at escrs. I'll probably have a better understanding at that point.
Jaran P: Okay, cool. Sounds good. All right. Updates from our side, last time we looked at the UK dashboard, this time, we have the Germany dashboard ready. I think you already saw it. So, do you have any questions?
Sarah C: No, I think it's good. I shared out the Germany dashboard with the German team this morning. Oops, it's a great thing. The only question I emailed you and ash this morning is that we need to just take off the start promotional dollar spend from the marketing portion from the input form for Germany and from the dashboards.
Jaran P: Got it. Okay. So.
Sarah C: It's just one little box down there. Oh, yeah, that's already gone. Perfect. Cool.
Jaran P: So that one. And then I think let's just double check that it's it should be, I removed it from here as well. So let's just double check.
Sarah C: Yeah, I need to comprehensive, I.
Jaran P: Think that's the last, it's the last one, right?
Sarah C: Yeah, it is… there, it is. Yeah, perfect. It's all done great. Thank you.
Jaran P: Okay. Yeah, no problem. Cool. Yeah. So everything is done for Germany right now. I created their homepage as well. So you should see everything. Anything I think that's it? Nothing crazy. Really. We changed all the titles, all the labels. Yeah. So that's the process.
Sarah C: Yeah. And I just asked Michael the head of sales for Germany just to double check it and run it. He ran some customer data, but he ran it with the us benchmarks. And when he reopened it up into the German comprehensive, the data was so much more in favor of Evo. And I was like that's why you don't run it until your benchmark information's in there. I was like, what are you thinking?
Jaran P: Yeah, because by default the us ones, yeah.
Sarah C: Right. I was like, please don't do that. So anyways, he was like, my God, the profitability is so much higher and I was like, yes, stop jumping the gun. It's ready for you. So, yeah. So I mean, I think we're all set. I have calls on Monday with Italy. Okay? And then I have distops after that. So I don't expect to have those prior to escrs prior to the second week of September. So I think we are all set and locked and loaded for the meeting and what the expectations are. And then we'll kind of we'll have more after the meeting.
Jaran P: Okay. Sounds good. So we have the Italy translations. Do we have the benchmarks for that already? Yeah. All right. Okay. So that's what we're waiting on. Cool. Yeah. Once we get that, I guess wondering if we can just like get it started. So even if they're able to send it, then we can just quickly update the benchmarks for you. So maybe we'll get started because we have the translation. So maybe we'll get started on the dashboard and then the benchmarks, we can just add in.
Sarah C: Yeah. And they say that they're going to get them to us next week. Okay? And I asked them and they said, oh, it's not due until next week. And I'm like guys you've got you've, had this for months like, so. Yeah.

John M: Good morning. How's it going?
Michael N: It's going good.
John M: Good. So, I'm a couple minutes away from my co, work. It opens at eight and the owner's never there right on time. So, no worries. I'll be camera ing at my desk in a couple minutes.
Michael N: Yeah, no worries. I.
John M: Didn't think it was super critical.
Michael N: Well, I was, I was a little bit late coming to this because Carl has, he was saying that, we should meet. We should do this one meeting fortnightly and I wasn't sure if that was every six hours or what that meant. So, I had to look that up.
John M: What is it every six weeks?
Michael N: It's like every two weeks, I think.
John M: Fortnight is every two weeks?
Michael N: Wow.
John M: Okay. Well, I learned something new then two weeks, fortnight is two weeks two.
Michael N: Weeks? Yeah.
John M: Oh, huh. All right.
Michael N: How'd that call go Dale?
Dale W: I just, you know, I lost sight of a ticket that we had raised that got stuck and hasn't moved for two days. And so, I don't know that's going to be kind of annoying, but I hope we have a little bit of runway to get it fixed, but it just got missed.
Michael N: A Domo ticket or?
Dale W: Domo ticket? Yeah, you can. So, even though we send things to a task queue and we've turned off all notifications. Domo still sends out notifications.
Michael N: Maybe the system doesn't agree with no notifications.
Dale W: Right, clearly, even though we're managing all of the stuff in an app and even though there is a form, it's all for the machine. So, a human looking at it would have no idea what the form is, but no good deed goes unpunished. Trying to use Domo's platforms to do things.
Michael N: So, let's, is there a ticket in there with deeper there is?
Dale W: I sent it to Joe to try to figure out how to hand carry it out of the system, but I realized Emmanuel probably left it in there. Didn't read the ticket, asked me what the queue was that was in the ticket? And then sent me some doc, a link to something that… I will just stop talking about.
Michael N: Nice. So, John, are you at your desk yet or do you need more time?
John M: No, I'm fine. I can talk. I'm just not like my plan was to be camera on at my desk looking really professional to Dale, right? But I'll have to do that around 810.
Michael N: So we're forcing John into a co work facility, Dale because he's remote. So, yes.
John M: Yeah, it's by choice. Nobody asked me to do it, but with the increased pressure with, on return to office and then, you know, asking the majority of my, you know, Utah based employees having to do five days in the office. Yeah, it's a little bit of an appearance thing. So it's like, well see, I'm in the office too. I'm one of you guys. I'm you know?
Michael N: So I put my pants on one leg at a time also.
John M: Yeah, that type of a thing. Maybe they don't care. Maybe they do. I don't know, I think it, I think it probably helps but nobody's coming out and it's possible. So it's like well because you, you're going to be a co worker, you know?
Michael N: Yeah. So, so Dale, I wanted to pull you and John together on this because I know, when you and I were talking, you're kind of going to you're going through the sow and kind of identifying areas that you and your team could do work and areas that Domo would need to do the work. And I just wanted to make sure that you had background on, what our architecture plan was for this. Okay? And I thought John would be better to describe that than myself. So that's what I wanted to get. Oh.
Dale W: You weren't going to do the dev on this one, Mike.
Michael N: I was told to stay in my Lane as a sales Guy.
Dale W: Fair.
Michael N: So, I just thought you and John would have a good conversation around this, and I know that as part of what we had in the MVP and I don't know if this was obvious in the sow but there was a utilization of some third party softwares where appropriate that we were going to license as Domo on your behalf, that would be part of this platform. So, yeah, where that came in, I just figured John would be the best one to talk through that… yeah.
John M: So, can we kind of zoom out just a little bit to understand kind of, I mean, I understand ipg kind of, right? But like I… assume, it's a large company, meaning you should have significantly more than Domo, which is around a 1,000 person company. Is that a fair assumption to make?
Dale W: Yep, health is a 7,500 and ipg is 25,000 Ish.
John M: Oh, wow. Yeah. Okay. So, and this is for ipg or ipg health?
Dale W: This would be health.
John M: Okay. So, around a 77 times bigger, than Domo?
Michael N: Yeah, yeah.
John M: Okay. And then, and… it's not like, you know, I'm sure there's a lot of different revenue drivers inside of a 7,500 person company… how big of a, like how many people work on this, of that company? Like what percent of revenue is driven off of this? Like what… are we looking at there?
Dale W: That's Domo sized… that's what it's Domo sized and it's contribution if we're using those ratios, right?
John M: Okay. But.
Dale W: This thing is more, it's… kind of one of those pull through revenue things and a necessary evil type of thing. You have to have it because people want it. Once you get it, it's very unlikely that they will leave you for it because it's very hard to transition off of it. But it's a necessary part of the entire medical communications bundle. And so, having it is a differentiator in the game and something that while its revenue contribution is small, it pulls through a much larger revenue stream.
Michael N: And are they accounting for that? Like is Ariel accounting for that? I know Doug probably doesn't know it yet, but, well.
Dale W: So… kind of they're trying to keep it compartmentalized though, which I don't know that it's the right thing to do. But they're not asking me for that opinion. They're trying to say that the percentage of revenue that's dedicated to this, whatever we invest in it should be proportional to that. And, you know, but for everything that you just said, right?

Vikram N: Hey, guys. How are you?
Randy B: Good. How are you?
Vikram N: Not too bad. I think Kieren is joining too, but Dan is on his sabbatical so he'll be back middle of October. So, I think it might be just us like me and Kieren today, right on. Yeah, I,
Randy B: thought you were going to say 20 27 or something?
Vikram N: Oh, no, I mean, that would be great, but no, just six weeks.

Randy B: Cool. Renton? Yeah, north Seattle, I think I was just there for, I think you guys had some, I think there's a market there every Sunday somewhere near you? Can't remember where it is?
Vikram N: Yeah, I'm sure there is. I don't leave my house really, so.
Randy B: Oh, you don't leave your house? Is that what you said?
Vikram N: Yeah. I mean, since covid, I've turned into a troll.
Randy B: Oh, no, yeah. It's so pretty out here though. In the summers, it's tough to not leave the house.
Vikram N: That's an exaggeration. But, yeah.
Randy B: Hey, Kieren, hey, peral. So, I think we have everybody now then if Dan's not joining, right?
Kieren P: Yeah. Dan's on RR, so he's out for the next like five weeks.
Randy B: Okay. Yeah. Let's kick things off then. I just have one update relative to that dashboard Kieren that you had emailed about. There's a quick start one that's out now that I think you guys may have seen or should have seen months ago, but matt torlin who's seen as a C, he had customized one that has more cards and should be better for you guys in terms of visibility of what's being used and by who, and he's in the process now of working with Neil to get that installed in your instance. Amazing once that's done because Neil couldn't give him access. So he's giving him the repository and then through sandbox, he's going to install it. So once that's done and matt helps Neil walk through or walks Neil through connecting to your, to the zillow data, then we'll coordinate a call for matt to go over that customized dashboard for you guys that he's built, right? And then from there, it's just going to be a matter of I guess Neil giving you guys access to that dashboard or somebody from Neil's team, giving you guys access to that dashboard?
Kieren P: Okay. Yeah. That's perfect.
Randy B: So, hoping days instead of weeks, it looks like from the communication I'm seeing from Neil and matt, it looks like that should be done before the end of this week, so we can either schedule something for I'm actually in HQ, all of next week. So if it's done, you know, today or tomorrow, maybe we can set something up real quick for Friday or Thursday, if not the week after next, I'll schedule something.
Kieren P: Okay. Yeah, that works for us.
Randy B: Yeah. So Kieren, I'll double check with you with some timing that works. And then we'll just coordinate from there, you and me.
Kieren P: Yeah, that's perfect. Okay?
Randy B: And then, yeah, that's it from my side from the CSM side. Signe, I'll kick it over to you before we hand it over to the zill team.
Signe P: Yeah. I think the only thing that what's top of mind for me is just, I know that Dan feels pretty confident that you guys are going to be in a good spot. So Parul, I guess that's to you and the team since Dan's not here. How that is going, how we can partner with you and best support you on that.
Parul G: Yeah. I think we're thinking to start handling it in Q4 on some of the things like making some of the changes in terms of let's say data is refreshing multiple times. So if you want to reduce the frequency, maybe that. So we have some like low hanging fruits that we might want to align at our end. But I think apart from those in terms of, we took a look at how much data we have used this year, how that ramped up over the year, what it could look like for the next year and what the thresholds could be like, how much, every, how many reports we can build early in the year versus later in the year that's the kind of plan we are coming with that to help us out evenly spread out the consumption and not run into like overages. So, I think we are feeling confident there because of like we understand the thresholds and what it might take for us to tweak the ways of working and executing that's. Why I think we are feeling in a, you know, confident spot that we'll be okay next year. So as we get started after mid October once Dan is back because he's going to leave that project… we might reach back out if we need anything else from you guys. But at this point, I don't think we are looking for, you know, immediate start on it. Post mid October is like in a month is when we can, you know, speak more to it.
Signe P: Perfect. Yeah, that's all for me. I'll make sure that we were aligned with you. Sorry, go ahead.
Kieren P: Yeah, I was going to say, yeah, compq for, I think we do want to do just some data cleanup just like some easy wins for identifying stuff we can delete or recursive. We don't need just kind of free up some of that storage. Our plan I think moving forward into 20 26 is unfortunately, we've had demo for a while. So a lot of our core data sets have been running and they will be tagged as legacy. So that is all good. I wish Dan was here. So I think we'd have to connect back when Dan is back because he did kind of build just like a napkin math model about. So for 20 26, I think any new data flow we create, we will only have it run once a day. And that's kind of like the best way for us to really keep under the credit thresholds that you guys set. So if we, he did this is like napkin math. I'm just going off the top of my head here, but it was something along the lines of if we, for any new data set, if we were to have it run once a weekday. So let's just say that's like 20 25 Ish days throughout the week or throughout the month between Neil's team and our teams. If we were to build outputs equally to run once a day throughout the entire year, we would be able to build like nine outputs across both teams every single month.

Michael D: Right. And not be sweating.
William M: Yeah.
Shane W: Fall hasn't hit yet.
Michael D: It's coming around slowly at least for Ohio, yeah.
Hrithvikvijay L: Here in Dallas, it's the same, I think.
Shane W: Nice. I think we're going to be meeting… today. I wanted to just give an update on where I'm at and what I'm doing. I started moving things… over… to the magic. And as I was moving it and I was thinking about moving everything over there. Now, we're kind of still early stages of that and hasn't been decided exactly how we do that. But one of the things that I came across was… agents like an AI agent that can take the SQL and turn it into plain text. And then there's also some development of an agent that can take that plain text and convert it into magic. So I was, I've been and maybe I'm kind of going down a road that's too early. But instead of having to do all 400 adrenaline data flows… potentially, we could use AI to convert those for… us. And so I just, I started kind of going down, that path… and looking at how we can, how we can implement that and build that out of agent that can do that. So, I've been talking with a few people and seeing if we can get some momentum there because I don't think I'm going to be able to do it like by myself, I may need a little bit of help. So I'm trying to kind of see what kind of additional help I can get. It just only be for the fact that like… it's overwhelming to think of moving all those adrenaline over to magic. I think that we'll be in a better spot if we can kind of automate that process anyway. So that's what, I've… been kind… of focused on. I don't I haven't I don't have, that magic ETL that I, that I've been the one the kind of the POC that I've been working on at the door yet, but I will have it done soon.
Michael D: Shane, for that idea of using agents, is the end result an actual data flow that has an id and all the tiles built into it? Or is it just giving like instructions of what you need to do to then build it now?
Shane W: It's it would be, the output would be the would… be the Json, that those data flows the magic etls are built on. So it would, you would, it would create, that Json. And then we would push it in to Domo using the cli tool. And then we, and then it would we'd be able to… an actual data flow that outputs. The, the hard part is on some of the like very basic things it's not too bad. And, and what's nice about using the SQL to text is that we can go in and say, well let's understand really what's happening because that's part of the problem with like when I'm moving things over to magic is understanding like, okay, what is this bit of SQL really doing? And, you know, that can take, you know, five minutes to figure out. Sometimes they can take it takes an hour to figure out. And, but the, those agents can kind of understand that, and it's not always perfect. But they can understand it at a fairly good level, and clearly delineate what it's doing and the steps that it's happening to get the output that we want. And so so then once we have that, we could put it into an agent that can convert those steps into the tiles and… configure those tiles to do each of those steps or even put. And maybe even, you know, we do have the SQL tiles inside of a demo. So if there's not a easy tile, you know, like if there's a select columns for sure, that's easy to do. We just use the select columns. But if there's more advanced configuration or transformation that's happening that we don't have a tile for, we can even put it into just the SQL tile. So the… in the end to answer your question, yes, might look like we will be able to like have a actual data flow and not just a step for the data flow but actual data flow that we can do it. Now. There's still some review… right? That has to happen, but at least it's a it's gonna increase our speed from, you know, doing one or two data flows a week to even all a week and then a week to, or two to do them. But I mean this is all in theory, it will work. It's also, I just want to kind of put… a warning, you know, that it's like not an exact science at this point of exactly how to do it. So there's going to be a little bit of learning curve and take a little may take longer, than I expect, but yeah, anyways, so that's kind of the update I wanted to give is that's kind of where we're where I'm headed with doing this project is that I just think the mating, it is going to make a lot easier for be able to actually… to be able to get this done in a reasonable amount of time without all of us pulling our hair out. It's because it'll take a long time to do it. Otherwise, I.
Michael D: Appreciate the update. I definitely think the human and the loop will have to be a factor just to just make sure it's working correctly even to set the triggers in terms of how those things fire. I don't know if that's something that the agent can include in its output as well.

Benjamin P: Yes.
Phil S: Hey, good afternoon. Well, looks like we got you on mute.
Amrit: Okay. Hey, hey, good afternoon. Can you hear me?
Phil S: We got you now.
Amrit: Yeah. It took me a few seconds to figure out the mute here because we typically don't use zoom. It's like where is the, normally, most of the stuff is in the bottom section. It's like, oh, it's in my profile picture on top.
Phil S: Yeah. Sorry about that. Yeah, we do teams as well. I need to keep doing teams for home depot. Ours defaults to zoom, but yeah, first of all, just great to meet you.
Amrit: Yeah, same here. Thanks for scheduling this up. I've been hearing a lot about you guys from different people at the workplace, from the product engineering team from Roger as well. So, I'm responsible here for data science and analytics within the private brand group. I report into Roger. Okay been working with this group for the last six to seven years now.
Phil S: Okay.
Amrit: So, yeah, very excited to see how we can collaborate and maybe help our engineers do their job more efficiently and seamlessly.
Phil S: Love that. Yeah. And I love to hear that. Word is spreading, right? Yeah.
Amrit: No, that I can guarantee that Domo is spreading.

Amrit: Am in the Atlanta office. Yeah. Okay.
Phil S: Perfect. Yeah, we were out there. Gosh. I actually, I guess it was like a month ago, but we should be out there again soon. So, we'll definitely let you know when we're in person next time. I think I'm trying to work, with Bryce weider from the product team on being out there, maybe first week of September or so. So, if that gets finalized, we should be able to get out there soon and would love to meet you in person and it's always a little easier, you know, taking a lot of this info in there too, is.
Amrit: That around the protocol database or something?
Phil S: It is, yeah. Well, we're finishing up phase one of the protocol database and the project that we've scoped out and we're presenting on next week. It's like phase two of that is more of what we're calling like a testing management system. So kind of augmenting the product lifecycle management system project of the team migrating to trade beyond. The idea is trade beyond is a great product lifecycle management system, but there's still, you know, as you're aware like just a lot of manual process and manual, a lot of it ends up in email. So Domo is a full workflows system as well. So what you know, Ben has helped design and scope out is the idea to create an interface not only for the engineers but also the service providers, the suppliers like portals that they can go into to where we're entering, you know, communicating with each other inside one space and then kicking off different workflows to just make more of an interface. We're calling it kind of like I forget what term we use, but the idea is like a day in the life, you know, view for an engineer where, okay, what are the things that I need to do? Like what's missing artwork, what's… and then being able to kick off workflows, what's waiting on, you know, additional files and just having all that in one space, not replacing anything a PLM is doing, but more of the workflow keys, hopefully getting less more out of less in excel, less in email and more in an interface.
Amrit: Makes sense. Yeah, I'm so.
Phil S: Excited about that one. Let me introduce our team for you. Sure. We're excited to talk to you too. And I'm Phil Stewart enterprise account executive here, been at Domo a little over three years. I'm in the Austin, Texas area, but in Atlanta, pretty often working with home depot. I've been working with home depot just over three years. We, we started in the supply chain department within reverse logistics is where we had an initial use case. But I've been working with Bryce and the team close to two years or so within product engineering. They were kind of our second big department to start using Domo. And then as you mentioned, word seems to be spreading. We're also talking with merchandising talking with some AI specific teams to where we can fit. But we've already got been through all the third party security audits. We've got a service account into Google bigquery already. And so, and we're an unlimited user platform. So our goal is to, you know, help just build, you know, more and more things, where we can add value there too. But yeah, that's me. I'll turn it over next to Ben.
Benjamin P: Yeah. I'm a senior technical consultant here at Domo. I've been here for going on two years. I was a customer for seven years before coming over and I worked with many customers like yourself to build out technical solutions using both AI agents, workflows. Sometimes it's dashboarding, sometimes it's custom data pipeline. So whatever the solution warrants, I help build that out on the execution side and on the teaching side. If, you know, if it's something that the customer wants to facilitate themselves and just have somebody guide them. I can certainly help in that area too. So looking forward to working with you and then the rest of the departments within home depot, looking forward to working with each of them as well. So.
Amrit: Sure. Happy to meet you.
Phil S: Yeah, colt, would you like to go next yep?
Colt S: I'm colt, I'm one of the senior solutions architects here at Domo. Like Ben, I was also a former customer which seems to be a recurring theme here. I'm on the POC's team now. So I'm primarily focused on proof of concepts, but here over the last few months, I've had a heavy focus on AI proof of concepts specifically. So dealing a lot with building different agents and tasks and things like that. So it's great to meet you.

Kevin M: Doesn't exist?
Joe P: That's what it said. Let's see it made it over to the workflows engineering team.
Kevin M: Yeah. I mean, that's one that we pulled from the documentation. I mean, ultimately, we don't really have visibility into when a workflow has completed from a custom app, so.
Joe P: We were.
Kevin M: Trying to know… if the workflow completed or if it erred really, we just wanted the status.
Joe P: Yeah. I remember poking around this one with Dale. I'll have to let Tiva probably respond back up. She chats with engineering because the ticket here is more conversational back and forth. It's not a valid URL. So, what are they trying to do? Are they trying to start a workflow instance? So it looks like Tiva probably needs to get back to them on this ticket. So, I don't have an update for you unfortunately to give on this one right now.
Kevin M: Okay. Yeah, I mean, it's definitely in the documentation. So that might just be outdated.
Joe P: Yeah. The documentation was… this one where we found out that you had to put, I don't remember, I've worked on a few endpoints with Dale where we found out that you had to put an offset on the end of it or? No? Does that sound familiar?
Kevin M: That does sound familiar. And no, that was for, I believe that was for tasks.
Joe P: You're right? That was tasks. Okay. I'll ping Tiva, though, let her know to get an update on this because there's conversation going on the ticket, but it doesn't look like it's been resolved yet.

Michael N: All right.
Tracy P: I have one question, Carl, you may already be prepared for this, but I do know that all of our emails are going to be changing. Is that going to be a problem with our access? And our accounts? Is there anything we need to do up front to make sure that everyone keeps their access?
Karl A: I wasn't aware of this but fortunately, we actually have something in place internally that we can use. That is a good question. Is there anything that like Domo has that we can use in this case?
Joe P: Not for we do not. So, the way that I've done it with other customers is just a bulk download, change the user. You make an update in the column in the spreadsheet, and re, update it and re upload it and it'll swap it. I don't know how that all works though with sso, Carl, you guys are using sso, right?

So, I'm trying to have as tight of a control on consumption credit usage as possible. So I'm hoping that we can put maybe a little bit more effort there.
Ivan S: Yeah, we can definitely.
Tom H: Building up the roadmap.
Jenna H: Yeah, that's definitely, I did have that noted as something we did talk about a little bit last time. And so do you want to, with this renewal piece? I had a note that it was trying to get ready to justify the cost of Domo to the business was a big piece of it as well. So between like the credit optimization and like the cost and renewal and things like that. Do you want to just at a high level, kind of talk us through… where your head is at in terms of like the value and the usage of Domo versus maybe some of the others who have like budgetary approval and things like that we need to help support you in terms of using Domo at the budgeted level. So.
Tom H: I see it as two sides of the same coin, right? I think that we've got a fairly good idea of how Domo is valuable, how the reporting is being used. We've got great saturation through all the different elements of the business. But what I think that I don't have at least in like a button up presentation, maybe that I can elevate or pitch someone would be something that says, okay, here is… how we generate value and how we generate usage out of it. There's something a little bit more advanced than just X, number of users, y, number of views, Z, number of pages, those sorts of things because whenever you're talking about value, right? There's nothing necessarily saying that a dataset has value just by existing. And then on the backside of the coin, I want to also be able to show, these are the systems and controls that we can put in place to minimize the risk of egregiously running over budgeted consumption. So, I see that the two kind of go hand in hand because there's a question of, you know, okay, how do we make sure that the value is there and then corresponding, how do we make sure that the cost is controlled? And so I think if we're able to present both sides of that coin that will be an easy, it will make the conversation at renewal easier. I guess is where I'm going.
Jenna H: Okay. For that renewal conversation, is that a conversation you need to have with somebody else within greenway to get approval for budget?
Tom H: Yeah, it would be a conversation with myself with our director of it and with our senior director of financial planning. I'm not sure if you guys know Ken and mark. I know Simeon met with all three of us. Rob did as well, so he could maybe clue you in a little bit more about those two. Because that's essentially the way that the conversation went when we talked, you know, initial renewal proposals was, you know, there's only so much that we can do on a blank check, right?
Jenna H: Right. Okay. We will definitely talk more about this. And then I do still because the roadmap is not… just focusing on one single use case. It's like a plan a build out over time. So we do want to also keep the other components that we talked about last time in there as well because I do think those are going to help add value. And, you know, it may be in a way some of that trade off of managing credit usage in certain areas where we don't need to necessarily be using those credits, but then allocating some of them towards like AI features and functionalities, right? So I don't want to fully just shut the door on like some of those other conversations that we had if that sounds good?
Tom H: Yeah, no, that sounds perfect. And that's the sentiment that I've been trying to spread a little bit more that at some point the math just does not work out, right? If, you know, you're trying to drive 100 Miles on a 80 mile tank of gas, you're just going to run out of gas. And it's pretty self evident that we continue to have new projects within Domo. We continue to have new initiatives. So it's not like there's ever going to be a situation where we are decreasing velocity in terms of Domo usag",Consumption Pricing Model,250160.05,Corporate,GREENWAYHEALTH.COM,11,Retail,1310,$250M to <$500M,Renewal,Blank,2: Determine Needs,Rob Staples,2026-01-01,2024-01-11,2024-01-11,,,,,,0015000000vr9eVAAQ

","Appu C: hey, it's absolutely getting good.
Lindsay G: Good. If you guys are good with it. I'd love to just jump right in to where we left off yesterday so that we make sure we've got enough time.
Appu C: Sure. Let me share my screen. Let me know if you can see my screen.
Lindsay G: It just loaded. Yeah.
Appu C: Okay. So, I think… we have done almost everything except connecting. Okay, we'll start from where we left. Should I go here here? This is the one.
Lindsay G: Yes, exactly. And then to edit the data flow, you'll Qlik the edit button in the upper right hand corner.
Appu C: Great. And.
Lindsay G: Did you have any questions about anything we did yesterday before we continue on?
John D: I kind of had a question. Sure. The group by, is that considered like creating a filter?
Lindsay G: No, it is aggregating. So if you Qlik on one of the group by tiles, we're… aggregating by job number, so that it is getting us the max… move to flower date. So if there, which we wouldn't expect right there to be multiple move to flower dates for a job. So it's just getting us the max date available for each job. Same with the harvest date. And it's just checking to see if the activity code equals move to flower, then get the max date for that for each job. When activity code equals harvest, then get the max date for the job. And then for the quantity, we're checking for the activity code equaling harvest and getting the max quantity there.
John D: Gotcha. Okay. For some reason, I was thinking it was filters that we were working on, but I can see at the left side, there is a filter… menu, I guess.
Lindsay G: There is a filter tile. So if you Qlik on that left rail where it says filter the drop down arrow? Yep. Then you have filter rows and remove duplicates. So you can filter rows based off of. So like if there was any bad data that we needed to filter out or if let's say we only needed to look at harvest data, we… could drag that filter tile onto our data flow and create a conditional statement or just filter off of a single column. So it gives you the option to filter on a column or a condition?
John D: Gotcha. Okay.
Lindsay G: Any other questions?
Appu C: No, but we'll have a lot of questions when we start working. Yeah, when we start creating the column, yes.
Lindsay G: Okay. So yesterday, we left off here where we grabbed. So we did the aggregations that's where we left off. Do we have any other calculated columns?
Appu C: Yes. So, I think… yeah, grams per plant, I think it is taken care. It's a simple calculation. I don't know if this is done. So, it's a simple calculation of, you know, dividing the weights… you know, column J, whatever is the weight divided by the days. Okay? And I don't sorry, divided by the plants.
Lindsay G: Okay. Do we need to do the days first? Or I guess it doesn't matter what order these are done in as long as we're not referencing a calculated column?
Appu C: Yeah, I think, yeah, let's do the days. Let's start with the days, this one. Okay?
Lindsay G: So, for the days, that one, if we Qlik on the formula in excel again, sorry, I just need to refresh my memory.
Appu C: Yeah, no worries. So this is, so this one is just the difference between the hours date and the date.
Lindsay G: Oh, okay. Easy.
Appu C: Yeah, easy. So.
Lindsay G: Let's go back to our formula tile and you can give it the same name that is listed in the legacy master data.
Appu C: Okay. So, do I need to go here or we can use the same formula here?
Lindsay G: Yeah, we'll write out the formula, but we do need to give it a column name as well. So, right there, to your right in the formula tile?
Appu C: Right.
Lindsay G: There, just where your cursor was, you're so close right there. Yep. You'll type in the column name.
Appu C: Okay. So that's called, what would it be? Okay. So that's the, yeah, difference between. Yeah, our state. So that's going.
Lindsay G: To be a date diff function. So, if you start typing date diff. Yep. No space in between though. There you go.
Appu C: Okay. Yeah.
Lindsay G: And then you'll put the harvest date first? I have two harvest date options.
Appu C: Let me try there's a neat difference.
Lindsay G: Oh, we, should I'm just curious one's for underscore date, is that, oh,
Appu C: there's an underscore. There's one with an underscore and one without the underscore.
Lindsay G: Okay. The one without is the one we just created, right? How?
Appu C: Can we check… that?
Lindsay G: Well, we could go to the work order route by.
Appu C: Work order route by?
Lindsay G: Yep. If you Qlik on that. But where is the harvest underscore date coming from?
Appu C: If.
Lindsay G: you go to select columns on the work order?
Appu C: Yeah.
Lindsay G: So, the next one over select columns. So the next tile over, sorry, so you're on the work order tile, you need to go.
Appu C: This one. Sorry, yeah.
Lindsay G: No worries. Let's scroll down. Okay. So we're not bringing in harvest date from there. Now, we need to look at item entry, the item entry, select columns to see if we're bringing it in there. No. So it must exist on the job table. So the jobs must already have a harvest date on them if you were to Qlik on the job table input.
Appu C: No job will not have the harvest date.
Lindsay G: It's coming from somewhere. So let's look at data handling here.
Appu C: Okay.
Lindsay G: And scroll down. Okay, scroll up to the H'S.
Appu C: Oh,
Lindsay G: just above that… right there, it is. Okay. So there is a harvest date coming in? Is there a move to flower date also coming in if you scroll down… if you scroll up?
Appu C: Yeah.
Lindsay G: No. Okay. Interesting. So, I don't know what the harvest date is on the job table, if it's populated already, and we don't need to grab it from the work order. No.
Appu C: I'm not very confident about this, the harvest date under job table because I need to check, but it should be from the work order.
Lindsay G: Okay. So let's remove any confusion there and go to the work order tile. And on the left table, let's drop harvest underscore date. If you scroll up right here, just, yeah, right there. Okay? And now you can just drop that. Okay.

Todd B: Good. Can't complain?
Phil S: Awesome. I am actually going to be on site with you guys on the sixteenth, kind of a last second trip, but, okay. Are you in the office next week?

Todd B: be good.
Phil S: We can, you know, have a quick session if you want. I'm going to be meeting with product engineering at three o'clock eastern. And then I've got a morning meeting with a different customer, but I was planning to get there. I could do like after a while, like a one o'clock or something.
Todd B: So, we're we have one of our big meetings. We're busy from 12, basically 11 to three.

Todd B: I'm busy, but I can do before 11 or after three?

Phil S: I live in the Austin, Texas area, Austin, Texas, that's right? Okay. Yeah.
Todd B: Not a bad. Not a bad flight over.
Phil S: Yeah, not too bad at all. And I try to, I mean, I've got a, I've got three, three young kids all under four. And so, yeah, when I travel, I'm like, all right. Who all, can I possibly, you know, see while I'm.
Todd B: you know, yes, no, that makes no.
Phil S: No offense. But I'm like, all right. Let me just try to let's try to get, you know, if I can meet with all my customers in Atlanta and like try to do all that once and then, you know, get back, yeah. Qliksense, no, that.
Todd B: That makes sense. Do you don't have you don't have twins? Do you, do you have twins?
Phil S: Up there. No, no, okay. We just packed it in for, so that, yeah, we're done at this point, but we had a four year old and then my son is, he's going to be two or so. She's almost five. She'll be five, New Year's Eve, and then we've got, my son's all will be two in October, but then we've got a six month old. So my two youngest are the ones that are right right next to each other. We had the two under two. That makes things crazy, when I leave town, basically, we just have to have for like bedtimes and baths like, so like somebody to come over to help my wife cause it's just impossible.
Todd B: Yeah. I know some people who've got a few under four, and usually there's like a set of twins in there. We actually have someone on our team who has two sets of twins. Oh, my gosh. So, I think she's got five kids under the age seven, or under, I think, at… this point, which is like, I don't even know how you go about starting your day when you got five kids under the age of seven. But yeah, she gets it done.
Phil S: Yeah, I would love to see what kind of stroller they have. I've seen these, they have insane strollers these days now. Yeah. Like I've seen the ones where people have two sets of twins, where they have like folds out like three rows. It's like a giant, like stretch van or something of strollers and like that.
Todd B: They get it figured out Ben, how you doing?
Benjamin P: I'm doing well, Todd. How about yourself?
Todd B: Good, good.
Benjamin P: Yeah, Phil and I have really, we've been looking forward, to meeting with you again on this. I know that I don't know how much, I don't know how much progress you've made on your side, I imagine probably not a significant amount. But, what we would like to do, well… really two things, in the short term, we would like to better… understand, the easiest way to obtain… the smallest amount of data that we need to build out something useful within the demo platform, right? Yeah. So, sort of an MVP like, you know, if it's just a manual spreadsheet upload that we do for now just so that we can get something put together, that would be fine too. And then the long term would be okay. Well, let's figure out where this data actually lives and connect to that, so that we can automate this, sort of proof of concept that we've already built out using a static upload, so that's really like a short term and a long term because we want this to be as easy as possible for you. And we understand that connecting to the source data, is a bit technical and probably not something that we can, deploy, very quickly just due to the fact that there's, some effort that we're going to need, on the home depot side to understanding where that data is and getting connected to that. And so, I think in the short term, for, to be able to provide something, valuable quickly if we could, if you could help us understand, is there a spreadsheet somewhere? Is there some, is there data that we can get quickly? That would allow us to go ahead and start building something up?
Todd B: And so, I've been thinking about it a little bit too. And being a former teacher, I should have been thinking about, my learning style like during this whole time too is that I think I'm somebody who likes to understand rather than just like getting something. I like to understand what's happening in the background, right? And so when we had the one meeting and we uploaded something, and all of a sudden we were like dragging things around, right? Like if I don't know why we're dragging something around or how the dragging things around and connecting things really works, that's something where I get frustrated and I'm like, okay, like I, in order to do this, if I don't understand what's going on, I'm never going to be able to use this thing, right? And so, I mean, I'm a language Guy, I used to be a language teacher, right?

Juliana J: Brian will be over shortly. He is stuck in another meeting, but we can start with stuff we don't need Brian for. So, I know Nick was able to get the boats group connection sorted. So, I think we wanted to just confirm we have all the data and then kind of figure out where we need to plug that in to get it into the dashboard.
Phone C: Okay. Yeah, no, that was super exciting to see on the email sheet. We were like, ooh, perfect timing too because boats group came back and was like, well, we don't have the bandwidth to do this right now. Like, okay. Well, thank you for waiting a month. So, let us know.
Juliana J: I'm glad it worked out.
Nik K: Okay. Let me quickly. Just pull up. I was able to pull in. It should really be the same report. And then I just quickly set this up. Both of these are new connections just so we know, you know, it's tracking daily and still pulling in.
Phone C: Okay.
Nik K: Yeah. So this is September thirtieth. So, yeah, I think it pulls in until the day before, right? So this is okay. And then intelligence is October first. So let's go, take a look at this, go to dataset. So this should look familiar. Hopefully you've got your offices, boat numbers and then all the stuff about the boat, a bunch of these prices. I mean, I don't know which ones are used and then the actual marketing data coming in. So.
Phone C: Okay. I think it looks very familiar. Okay. So, I think my question is, are we going to delete or remove the old data? So it's not conflicting because I know there was an import issue with one.
Nik K: Okay. Yeah, I think we can switch them over. Just need to know which one that is. I don't know if, you know it there's this one here. I'm wondering if that's it, this ran in August. So, is this the one you upload to boat wizard metrics raw?
Phone C: File upload? Yes.
Nik K: Okay.
Phone C: I think the boat wizard, the other one I think is the one Mamta set up. Well, she set up both, but I think she might have used one as kind of like logic to match off the boat id. So I'm not 100 percent how that works.
Nik K: Okay. That's fine. I think if this is the one I'll trace wherever this is being used and then we can make… the swap. Let's see. Yeah, I figure it's this one that's driving. Nope. Okay. Oh, okay. This is the one that's on the dashboard. Okay? So that's pretty straightforward. We would just swap it out here.
Phone C: Okay. And confirming we'll pull, I believe February seventh is the date that we pulled the other data in. So we would pull the historic data.
Nik K: Yeah. Sorry, what's February seventh is a starting date?
Phone C: I believe so because that's when we launched our new website.
Nik K: Okay. So let's see. I don't recall what this was set up as I think I might have done year to date, but let's.
Phone C: see that's? Okay. That's not the end of the world. We can always set the filters when we're looking at the data in the dashboard, so that's fine.
Nik K: Okay. And I can go back and load the history. That's not a problem. And no, it's not close to year to date. It's actually… not that much, September. Okay. September 20 24. So there is one year of data?
Phone C: Okay.
Nik K: Did you mean February last year or this year?
Phone C: This year, right? Yeah, we launched it in 20 25, the new website then I think we're.
Nik K: covered. Yeah.
Phone C: Okay. Thank you.
Nik K: Sure. And just, I noticed one weird thing. So I just wanted to double check. I think it's okay. But there were just some movements just by office, right? Like do you expect this one dropped a fair amount. And then this one kind of increased instead.
Phone C: Give me one second. I just have to move… hold on… which one you said dropped.
Nik K: So, overall harbor Marina dropped like mid September and then it, this one looks like it took up immediately. So this is harbor point Marina.
Phone C: And this is number of listings?
Nik K: Number of listings, I believe. Yes.
Phone C: Interesting. Okay.
Nik K: There was that, and then there's this weird quirk here. I don't know if it's a data thing or if something happened on July and things just were not tracked by boats wizard, but.
Phone C: Yeah. I'm gonna guess it's something along those lines because we wouldn't have had a couple 100 boats at a location and then all of a sudden turned all of them off. So I think it might be something on their reporting side.
Nik K: Okay. I think that was it. I'm sorry, just looking, this is the number of boats listed. Yeah. Okay. So.
Phone C: Did you bring in active versus inactive? So the status of the boat… I think the column is called, sales status… possibly.
Nik K: Okay. Let's just go to the data set. Okay? Status? I don't see a status column.
Phone C: So, the only reason I ask is because we don't have 630 listings… actively. We have 400 and change. So my only thought is that maybe or condition maybe condition might be it? No. Oh, that would be new years in my brain.
Nik K: That might be like an all time count. So let's go to the bottom.
Phone C: That's true. Maybe I just didn't know if mom dealt only had active or inactive filtering through. And honestly, it'd probably be good to have both. Yeah.
Nik K: It's bringing in four 30. Is that? I don't.
Phone C: know, I'm thinking… well, no, because it has the data for the active boats historically. So never mind. Four. You said, what was it? Four?
Nik K: 430? Okay?
Phone C: I can confirm in two seconds. That sounds right. Yeah, yeah, because.
Nik K: And you said it wasn't conditioned. I mean, this is just new and.

Isabel D: I truly hate that for you. Oh, yeah.
Jenna H: This is a different background from your office.
Andrew B: Yeah.

Kristina D: Morning.
Ivan S: How's the team doing?
Andrew B: Good. How are you?
Ivan S: It's Thursday, the weeks just go by so fast. So, for today's, agenda, Christina, who's in our department? She'll be doing a demo of the marketing products for the first 30 or so minutes. And then whatever time we have left, we'll go over some more requirements gathering and any questions our team may have.
Andrew B: Sounds good. So.
Ivan S: I'll just let everyone join.

Andrew B: How's it going?
Jenna H: It is going. I was like, what day of the week? Is it today? It's Thursday? Awesome.
Andrew B: Valeria might be a couple minutes late. So, no worries. If we start early.
Isabel D: Okay.
Jenna H: Perfect. I know Scott should be jumping on in just a second Ivan. Do you have anything we need to hover right out of the gates?
Ivan S: No, I just set the agenda. I let the team know that Christina will go over a demo of the marketing products, data products for the first 30 or so minutes and then after that, we'll do requirements gathering and our team will ask any more questions that we have?
Jenna H: Perfect. Does that sound like a good plan to everybody?
Andrew B: Sounds good.
Jenna H: Awesome. Morning, Christina.
Kristina D: Morning. How are you?
Jenna H: I am good. How are you?
Kristina D: Good school's almost back in. Yay. Bye kids.
Jenna H: All right. Well, we asked Christina to be here specifically because she's helped out. She has a lot of marketing background and experience, and she, I'll let her introduce herself but she joined Domo, about a year and a half ago.
Kristina D: Now,
Jenna H: yes. So she does a lot of work with our marketing use cases and was part of building out this marketing data product that is available to you through the adoption engine. Normally it is an extra fee or you need to have like the ace package to get it. But this is part of the adoption engine and where I know there was interest in measuring your marketing efforts because right now it's being uploaded. It's not automatic. It's not super analytical. So, yeah, this could be a good fit and I really wanted to kind of walk through it but this is what we were talking about where we would help you make the connections. But the data product itself already has like the ETL built out and everything. So it would power the visualizations. And this is just like a base layer of visualizations like we could add upon this too. So it could be just a really fast and easy way to get this up and running and start giving you some insights. So with that, Christina, if you want to introduce yourself and start showing them all the wonderful work you've done on the data product.
Kristina D: Yeah, absolutely. So I am one of the business consultants that work with Jenna at Domo. Prior to that, I had nine and a half years of agency experience. I worked at a publicist group, worked across 35 plus accounts, doing client operations, data governance, strategic… alignment for onboarding clients, ensuring that we had the right data coming in and being able to support setting them up in all of their different platforms to buy across all their different channels. With that said Domo's been doing amazing work in understanding how can we provide better solutions for marketing? And right out the gate providing the marketing essentials package with, we know many clients are going to want something like Jenna said up and running, take these main data sources. Give us the dashboard across our main focal channels. And so this was developed, let me share my screen. Can everyone see my screen? It should say web performance? Yep. Great. You will have the opportunity to onboard GA, for three social platforms, SEO, and then one other data connection with that. Said you would have web performance, paid search, paid social and display. You can see these at the top of the app. They will all be laid out in a similar format. The beauty of this is it functions with a date grain selection. So you have this variable where I can look at week month quarter, we can set it up based on your fiscal year, how you look at it, whether it's your week start date is Monday versus Sunday. We can make sure that we customize based on how you look at your dates. And so if we did date grain selection month, you can do comparison month over month or you can look at year over year. You'll see the function on the right. Again, this is customized to be able to show you August first, 20 25 compared to August fourteenth. 20 20. Is that right? Yes, 20 24. Another function we can do is maybe you don't want to look at today's August fourteenth, last year, August fourteenth. You really want to look at how we did based on, the day of the week. So all of that functionality can be built in. And then as you pick your date, you select your date, all of your cards below will update you will have for your web performance sessions, your engagement rate, percent of new users. And then we have an AI function where it gives you a summary based on the metrics, how we're performing. So paid social performance showed strong growth with spend increasing 216 K, which is up 28 percent while delivering 63 point 5,000,000 impressions. As you change these, you will see… the AI… will update your actual summary. Any questions so far?
Jenna H: Okay.
Kristina D: Also to note we would be able to customize based on your branding. So if you wanted your logo in here, an image in the background, we are not just set in the green. It is very easy for us to update this. So that's a part of it.

Yeah, at first I thought it was our, Brian and I was like, okay… looked at the last name. Yeah. Hey.
Nik K: Everyone, how's it going?
Ashli M: Hello, Nick. Good. How are you?
Nik K: Doing well. So Juliana's out today. Brian is should be on his way soon as I understand it. But I just wanted to, you know, in the meantime follow up, he'll cover the visualization side and the best practices which we'd originally scheduled. But I just wanted to see if you guys had any follow ups from last week around the governance discussions, roles and groups. Or if there's anything that you wanted us to set up or, I mean, I think, you know, it'll eventually come into play as you bring more users in but just wanted to see if there's any follow up questions.
Ashli M: No, I mean, I think we know kind of what we need to be planning. Brian and I are going to have a working session this Wednesday on some architecture items. But from the governance perspective, I think I've got a good handle basically on what you guys have provided. We just need to do some internal legwork and have time to be able to do that.
Nik K: Okay. Sure. And then there is this one other topic on governance which we didn't go into depth on. So we talked about just different people having roles and accesses, what they can see in Domo, what they can do in Domo. And if you are just a consumer, you'll only get access to data sets and cards that are shared with you. We didn't get into the role level permissioning or column permissioning, just the PDP policies. So I just wanted to check if that's something that you wanted to walk through or if you've already kind of reviewed that.
Ashli M: I am familiar with that being available. I haven't really developed some good use cases in my mind in terms of how we're going to use it. I know we will use it. I did watch the community webinar last week about the column permissions, which that was really helpful to be able to see those different things and understand how those are inherited through. So that was a helpful overview for me.
Nik K: Okay. Yeah. I think just, you know, what some other credit unions have done were just sort of branch level reporting, right? Is a good use case for row level permissioning at least. So an area supervisor might see multiple branches or someone at HQ might see multiple branches. And then individual branch supervisors might only see what's their content, right? And I'm not sure how you're structured if you have regions and things or how many branches, but that's one use case that's come up.
Ashli M: Yeah. And that is something I had, you know, kind of considered we don't have, we need to set our user attributes up for the member center or the branch that they are a part of to be able to have, those particular groups and so forth to then have the permissions. But I think, the foundation of what I understand can work. I think I have a good grasp on it in terms of what I need to do when we come to that decision. There's just some building… up of some groups and some dynamic groups I want to be able to put in that we haven't quite done yet. So.
Nik K: Okay. Yeah. And then like with groups, right? Where you can make a dynamic or a managed attribute driven. One same thing with PDP, it can be very automated if you have, you know, your org structure or just where what branches and, what that hierarchy looks like somewhere in could be active directory, could be some other system, but we can always ingest that and that can automatically drive and keep these policies and access updated as well. So when you're ready for that, we can always talk through those as well.
Ashli M: Yeah, absolutely. I think that's a good plan right now. I know that I had to obviously turn like we're using department as a dynamic attribute. So I turned it off from being available for the users to configure on their own so that it's either admin managed or sso. So we could have those dynamic groups. So it's that type of thing just continuing forward. So I appreciate you bringing that up. So I like the column level pieces that were added in terms of being able to mask things. And then also the row pieces, I think your use case with regards to the branch setting makes a lot of sense as well because we do have distrox and branches. And so being able to filter through and have them only see what they need to see will be a good thing to deliver in the future.
Nik K: Yeah, and I'm sure you've thought through the column piece, but there's like two use cases that come to mind are just especially with customer data, right? You might have, you know, some people might need to see a customer's social or some other sort of kyc data without them, and others don't right? And they just need the overall customer master. So.
Ashli M: Yeah.
Nik K: That's one and then masking like credit card numbers and things right? Like, that comes with column PDP. And then the other one was just in terms of when you bring in users of different analytics maturity, right? Obviously, it's the rules and you let people build cards and some don't but even those who are building cards, right? You might have a data scientist who wants all 100 columns and someone might be, most people will be overwhelmed by that and you call them PDP, them down to here's, the core set, right? Which which you might want to deal with. So.
Ashli M: Yeah. No, I like that. I liked the, you know, being able to, I mean, they demonstrated about, you know, you're creating the data set and creating a second data set without the fields and then having to manage all of that. And I think this really provides a better solution for being able to be scalable and, you know, maintain the environment a little bit better, so.
Nik K: Awesome. Yeah, that was just the last piece of governance. I was just making sure we talked with you about, but.
Ashli M: No, I'm glad you brought it up because when I was watching that, I watched it this morning, I was thinking we didn't talk about the PDP stuff. And yeah, that's good. Thank.

Simon N: Oh, yeah. Got a couple of new faces for you to meet today. Appreciate you taking time out of, I'm sure a busy Friday to jump on and chat with us. What do you have going on this weekend?
Sharr J: What do we have going on this weekend? My wife and I are going to this very cool dinner experience. They do every summer where I live. We're the local, I call him a celebrity chef. He's not really to us in small town, Connecticut. There's a chef who does, he calls it dinner at the farm. And so every summer, he goes to a farm and prepares dinner with local ingredients. It's pretty cool, very communal. Everybody sits at long tables.
Simon N: That sounds like a lot of fun like a farm to table situation exactly. Oh, that's cool. Yeah, there's a couple of those out here in Oregon. I haven't pulled the trigger on one yet, but it sounds like a good experience. You'll have to let me know how.
Sharr J: That goes. Yeah, no, thanks for asking. I hope you all have fun weekends planned as well.
Simon N: Yeah, definitely. Well, I know we got quite the crew here on the Domo side of things Jonathan, I can kind of provide a little bit of context as to the volume of folks on the call today. So, Domo is running a customer adoption pilot with a select handful of our customers that we identified as a good fit for the program. And so essentially Benjamin, Shane, Ankit, that's the team that they're representing today. Michelle is your recently assigned customer success manager. So she's new to the account but not new to Domo. She's been here for several years a lot longer than I have. And I've been here three years. So I feel like I've been here a long time. So that's a little bit of the context here. We can do a quick round of introductions, but really what we wanted to do today is kind of introduce you to this technical adoption team. Both Shane and Benjamin are Domo and snowflake certified. So I think these are a couple of resources and this program could make you look really good to Todd and, you know, to the whole analytics efforts at Alaris life. So, yeah, I wanted to kind of discuss that today, but that's a little bit of context as to the call. Does that all sound good?
Benjamin P: Sure.
Simon N: Awesome. Well, Michelle, I know I kind of did your introduction but you want to start with introductions on your side and we can go around to the demo team and then Jonathan, you can give us a quick intro too to get the other folks up to speed. You haven't met yet?
Meshell R: Yes, Jonathan. Nice to meet you again. My name is Michelle. I've been here for seven a little bit over seven years started in the partner consulting group, helped build that out initially and move over to client services just before covid hit us all. So, very nice to meet you and looking forward to supporting you.
Simon N: Thanks, Michelle. Benjamin you want to go next?
Benjamin P: Yep. So I'm a consultant technical consultant here at Domo. I work closely with Shane. We work with many corporate, both corporate and enterprise clients, building out technical solutions, both front end and back end solutions. So we've worked with workflows or whether it be data pipelines, whether it be cloud amplifier, pulling in data from snowflake. I've done some festimats as well. So any part of the platform involving the technical areas of the tooling, we are heavily involved. And so we're looking forward to just better understanding how you're currently using Domo today and helping you get more value from the investments that you've already made. So.

Mamta B: Brian is not coming. I don't know if you have anybody from your side joining? Yeah.
Raymond A: Maybe Shelly. Well, I guess we can get started. Sounds good. All right. So, let's… start with. I'm gonna share my screen. All right. So, I'm having just some minor trouble with… a filter. Oh, wait, this is not the right one. I… thought this was Gupta, do you remember which card it was? Was it this week? I think it's this week, these two week to dates. All right? All right. So I have… a beast mode… weekday display week ending end. All right. So just… give you like a quick rundown. So I have this beast mode that is basically, it's going to give me, it's going to filter that card on Monday. It's going to give me last week, but on Tuesday through Saturday, it's going to give me current week. Okay? So it's basically just saying it's going to give me the most current week which if I hit the drop down, it's 40, right? But if I want… if I want this to be dynamic, right? So, let me do this. So if I select 40, we're in the fortieth week, it gives me 928 through 10 one, which is correct because it's looking a day behind. So this is the most recent day we're going to have. So next week, this will change to 41. So I don't want to dynamically. I don't mean not dynamically. I don't want to statically set this to 40. I want it to dynamically always choose the most recent one. The most recent one is basically going to be not zero or blank, right? So this dynamically will always select… the most current week, right? See, so now we have 928 to 10 one. So next week 40 will disappear, but 41 will show up. And as long as I'm not selecting, you… know, all of the other weeks, then I'm always going to get 40. The problem here is if I set this over here to the sidebar, what… I want… is first of all to just… set this to null like basically no selection. But when I make my selection over to the right, I want it to recognize not in… right? I'm setting it to not in over here. And so I would expect to be able to say, okay, not in blank, but, it's not actually doing that for me. It's actually selecting.
Mamta B: Blank.
Raymond A: It's giving me the opposite of what I want.
Mamta B: Can we, because it's doing an in operation, it's not doing a not in.
Raymond A: Right? I need this to do the not in that I have set over here.
Mamta B: Don't think that's possible with the quick filters. It's always an in operation.
Raymond A: Okay.
Mamta B: So, you can say, so the blank that is there, you can give first in the beast mode, it's always recommended. Don't keep it as a blank or an all value, put that as some value, right? Say it is disregard… or something like that, right? So then the people can select the latest week, which is the 40 or something or you can say and replace the 40 to the current week. So when somebody selects the current week, it's just a text, right? So when you replace that too?
Raymond A: But I need it to be set dynamically because I'm going to save what I want to do is I want to be able to save this. Well, it's not, I don't want it to be 40. I want it to be blank because here, if I select, if I select what I actually want which is not blank, then it will save it to… the view here. So, and… this is important because, I don't want to add a top level filter. Okay? So that's the key thing. I know we can do this with the top level filter, but, you know, up here, but we don't want to do that. We want to keep it in the card. So, if I come over here because I saved it, oops, this is the wrong card because I saved it in the background here. When I expand this card, it's always going to default to what I chose, right? And that's good. This is what I want but it's giving me in not the not in, yeah.
Mamta B: True. What you can do is, can we go change the beast mode? I'll just tell you. I mean, you don't have to show you just want to show the text as a current week. So if you go well?
Raymond A: I understand what you mean but I still need it to, I still need it to operate as not in right? But.
Mamta B: Why if I changed it to in, because, you know, there is a restriction. I mean, it's not going to, I cannot change that to a not in right? So can we actually go and change the beast mode? So this beast mode which will beast mode is… yeah. So instead of saying week of current date, you can just say that to be in single quotes. You can just say current week, right? If that's all that is like if this is what you need, you just replace that with a text saying current week and then the other one is disregard or? And then this one also, I believe should be current week, right?
Raymond A: Oh, that would be past week.
Mamta B: It's not showing in your dropdown. So, I mean, you're only showing 40. So I don't know what that is.
Raymond A: Well… when the current day, when the current day is Sunday or Monday, right? Then, it's gonna look one week behind.
Mamta B: Yeah. But in the dropdown, it's still current week, right? Or no. I mean, it's still the fortieth week or is it 30 ninth week? If it's a Sunday or a Monday?
Raymond A: If, if today were Sunday or Monday, it would be 39, it would show up as 39.
Mamta B: But what experience do you want to say to the user? So do you want to say past week and they can choose the past week or do you want?
Raymond A: No, I, well, that's the thing I need it to. I need it to dynamically default to last week, Sunday and Monday, but Tuesday, to dynamically default to current week because it's going out in a scheduled report. So we don't want somebody going. We don't want to have to go in here and change the week and then manually set, the report. We want the report to just automatically send last week.
Mamta B: No. So that's a date filter, and view. So this is, so all this is doing, no. I mean, even if you, all this is saying is if my week and week of adjustment equal to this one and the order of adjustment is this one, then if… it's Sund",Consumption Pricing Model,630700.0,Enterprise,UPS.COM,3,Consumer Packaged Goods,536000,>=$1B,Renewal,Blank,5: Negotiations,Casey Dorman,2026-01-01,2025-01-08,2025-01-08,2025-08-25,2025-10-02,2025-10-02,,,0015000000Yrl38AAB

They agreed to implement a ""shop efficiency adjuster"" workbook to allow for adjustments to the efficiency setting, which should be set at a lower percentage than the default 80% to maintain consistency. William also proposed adding features to track individual welder performance and projected completion dates, which Ted found beneficial for monitoring progress and staffing needs.","Ted S: mr, Ted. How are we doing? How are you feeling about it today? Good? I only quickly was able to pull that up and play with it for about five seconds and that's all the feedback I got for you right now, no.
William W: Worries. No worries at all. If anything just trying to get you hyped up about it a little bit, I'll go camera off so it doesn't do the little.
Ted S: Well, yeah, I thought I fixed that by putting a piece of paper towel in front of it, but it wants to focus on you. So.
William W: No worries, dude. I'll go camera off so it doesn't mess around like that.
Ted S: Okay.
William W: So, I think we're in a super good spot. Obviously, it's up… to you and Tyson how you guys feel about it. Let me make this one thing real quick. Let's do just messing around with something real quick. Okay. So since the last time we had talked on. You had a few different suggestions and then Nick had a few different suggestions. I think I got them all. But what I'm counting on you is to keep me honest. So I'll kick it off just by I… got rid of the key up here because we're now truly marking like, hey, as they get work, that's good. It's not red. It's green, right? So like we want green. And so as this bar fills up more, it will get more green essentially. I think this is a little bit too light. So I'll probably make the base green greener… so to speak. But you can see the spillover is correct. Now we don't go over 100 percent utilized. I believe most of these are jobs that are actually assigned right now that are pulling in, not jobs that I've actually assigned. So I'll see them pop on throughout the day and it's kind of cool. This was not properly wired. And so now you can see as I adjust, this adjusts. And if you look at these bars as I adjust as well, you can see, can you see that bar, you know, moving up?
Ted S: Yep.
William W: Doesn't look like it's forcing spillover.
Ted S: I would assume we're going to end up keeping that barely fixed, shuffling it all over the places. And obviously realistic people aren't going to gain all that much efficiency. But over time, we kind of make some corrections to the way that we do our estimates. And so being able to update it over time is necessary. So, will that stay fixed every time I load the page or is there a way that I have to save that value? I'm just wondering if it's so it,
William W: was you beat me to the punch that's what I was going to ask you is like it's going to default to 80 every time the page load hits. But if you want me to store that and then have it return to where it was. I can do that.
Ted S: What I.
William W: would say and something you had said to me last time was like, it's more realistic for us to assign efficiency to a welder?
Ted S: I really.
William W: Like that for two reasons but I think this is a future task because like now you've kind of got another signal and it may not necessarily be the worst thing in the world, but if a supervisor is going to filter for all their people. And right here, it says what their efficiency percentage is adjusted to, you know, if this one's down here at 30 and this one's at 70, that's probably a good thing for the supervisor to have kind of constant visibility to. And it could become a talking point if that's how you guys roll is like, hey, you know, I'm clocking you at about 40 percent. Let's try to get that up closer to 60. Jared is sitting around 70 to 80, maybe go talk to him and try to get some best practices or something.
Ted S: So, yeah, no, I think that ties in. I mean, we'll, we'd work out some of that, specifics, but I think that's how we weight things generally for right or wrong. I think there's going to be more experienced people on our team that, are more productive generally on average, and we have, you know, lower skill, new trainees that are coming in bound to that. We probably want to wait down too. So, I think what I probably want just for sake of utilization would be to have it fixed though, at probably lower than 80. But to have it be like semi hard coded in where it requires me to intentionally update it. And that way it stays fixed across the board for our shop capacity. And so it doesn't default back to 80 every time. So, if there's a way to lock that in and paste it and leave that as a keep that as the fixed value, that would be ideal.
William W: Okay. So that's 100 percent doable. You've got two ways that I could make it so you can adjust that. One is like a workbook, that's somewhere in your instance, it's just called shop efficiency adjuster. And whenever you put that on, it will pull it into this. So like that's the easy way. And then the more technical way, if your hopes and dreams are like, to be able to figure out how to navigate back here a little bit, then I could just tell you where it's at in this and you could adjust it yourself. So, and we don't have to start with one and stay there forever, but.
Ted S: Yeah, it seems like a workbook would be, I mean, perfectly, fine. In my mind, I'm hoping it doesn't change a bunch. We are going through a bit of a overhaul on the way that we do our weld estimates generally. So, I assume I'll make a change here in the next short period of time, but I don't necessarily want that to be something that a lot of users are engaging with a ton. So, for the most part, I want to set it and forget it for a long time.
William W: Perfect. And certainly don't make it like the brightest thing on the page.
Ted S: Right. Well, in some ways, when it's low, I do want it to be on our mind that we're only getting that efficiency, but to some degree, I think it's better if it's just fixed and then, yeah, only changed sporadically.
William W: got it. And we'll leave this call out here, right? Like whatever we change it to, this will just reflect it instead of the ability to adjust it.
Ted S: Perfect.
William W: I agree with that. Okay. And then just so I can put it on my like mental rack… so to speak, do you, are you saying yes at a point we would like to have the efficiency to be able to be set on a per welder level? Or are you saying like let's just go ahead and leave it at shop level for the foreseeable future?

Katie B: It's just, it's Q3, Q3 is always crazy for us. So, it's just kind of the state of things. And then we'll go on the downhill, Q4 will be better, and then Q1 is always pretty quiet, so.
Juliana J: Okay. So you're in the thick of it right now?
Katie B: Yeah. All right.
Juliana J: Nick should be joining us here as well in a few minutes, but we can probably get started without him. So, we have on Mamta today, who is our Domo everywhere expert from consulting? So she can walk us through kind of a few different options for Domo everywhere. I know we were kind of just discussing how you want your clients to interact with Domo and that'll really determine how we decide to move forward with Domo everywhere. So, yeah, Mamta can walk you through what those options are and what it looks like in a lot more depth than any of us can since she's the expert. So, yeah, I guess Mamta, are there any questions you have that you wanted to ask Katie? Yeah, or did you want to? Okay? All right. I will hand it.
Katie B: Over.
Mamta B: and the first question I had was like, is your data set in Domo? Or is it somewhere outside of Domo? Yeah, like in your own pdw?
Katie B: Nope. Everything is in Domo. We bring in all of our data from various media sources or, you know, email uploads, if it's business data, and then everything goes through, you know, the back end of Domo getting cleaned and then we have, we are using all I think apps for everybody now as kind of like our client facing visualization.
Mamta B: Okay. So the data is in Domo. So I'm hoping it's all stacked data set, right? You get the data from various disparate sources, you combine them, transform them, and then it is stacked, right?
Katie B: Yes.
Mamta B: Okay. Awesome. So this is generally an architecture diagram we go through in the discovery sessions when we talk with customers. So it also provides an overall architecture of how does your environment look like, right? I don't know if you, do, you have a dev and a prod instance or just a prod instance?
Katie B: Yeah, we're just prod. Yeah.
Mamta B: Okay. So generally, the recommendation obviously is like for best practices, you bring in your data, you know, from various like using our different ingestion methodologies like a cloud connector, an amplifier, or a workbench or a jupyter workspaces, or a cli or a custom pipeline. In any way you can bring the data in Domo, you would basically aggregating those in like creating a consolidated data sets and then creating dashboards out of it. And then if you have a dev in a broad environment, then that bifurcates, you can, you know, follow proper version controlling and stuff for your data sets and stuff. That way all the development is happening in the dev and what is needed. Only the production assets are getting pushed to production, right? Once you have that, you know, your final finalized golden data sets in the broad environment, then this is where we talk about how do you, what experience do you want to provide to your users, right? We have different flavors of this experience or the shared experience that you can provide, to your users or customers or customers', customers. So the first experience is a view on the embed, right? So what happens with the view only embed is like you're embedding the dashboard or the app within your application and customers can do filtering, they can download as PDF and excel or powerpoint, and stuff like that, like reports using that, but they can't do anything more than that, right? They can interact with the dashboard. They can apply some filters and then they can export data. Okay? That's the view only experience. The second experience that we have is a publish or an edit experience. In the edit experience. It's bifurcated into two different products, right? One, you can have a white labeled experience, and other one is a non white labeled experience. The concept is similar. So what happens with that? Is once you have your content in your prod, you can then use a publish. We have a feature called publish. So you just create a single job and what it does is it will split out the content. Like it will push the content into all these different child instances and… it is going to apply the role level policy or the filtering that you have defined in the public shop for these instances. So what happens is if I have five media agencies, then media one data is going into this media, one instance, media two data is going into media two instance and media three data is going into the media three instance. It will go using one job. Dynamically, it will go filter the content and push out and virtualize the content into all these instances. Does that make sense?
Katie B: Yes. Yep.
Mamta B: Awesome. So, what does that enable you to do? Because it pushes out the content? Now, you have a complete instance for these users to do what they want. So, just like you have a Domo instance where you can go do an edit like you can go, you know, set up roles and groups and permissions in the instance. Similarly, you can, these users can, you can control what these users can do and what experience can these users have for each of these instances separately?

Eric G: Cool. Sorry, I wasn't able to join much last week and then we canceled Friday because a couple people, Brian was out and then boo and I both had conflicts too. So figured we'd just pick up this week, no worries.
Ankit S: Yeah.
Eric G: I think so Brian and I talked through. He kind of debriefed me on the conversation from Thursday and the rest of the week. I think things are starting to look really good. So, I think we're at the phase where I'm… going to likely after this meeting. Recommend we involve the rest of the finance team and have… them start kind of validating things too. Now that Brian and I have been kind of a first set of eyes. There's a few things I just want to spot check that I wasn't able to figure out. Brian and I talked through them this morning. Vu might have some theories just with him on here, but I think as a team, we should, there's still one or two things that I'm stumped… and then maybe what, you know, kind of up to you guys what you think the best direction is, I mean maybe the next step is to focus on, you know, what are the other big next steps from a formatting standpoint from a, you know, Brian and I have talked and Vu about like this like filtering of the books that we're doing as like a stopgap, probably not the best long term solution. So let's talk about that as well. But maybe I don't know unless someone wants to start somewhere else, I was gonna maybe see if we can look at these couple of issues that I can't quite figure out and see if there's a simple explanation. Sure.
Ankit S: Yeah. Okay. I was gonna say Aishwarya. Sorry. Yeah, I mean, I guess if we wanna start there, I know Aishwarya has a few action items, but let's start with Vu and just make sure we come back around to that. Okay?
Eric G: And it might be stuff we can't solve on this call. And again, if so, I really like I said, don't wanna hold up validation for the rest of the team. I think we figured most things out. I'm gonna share a quick ugly excel that will help me explain the variances I'm seeing, let me know when you guys can see this.
Aishwarya D: We can see it yep.
Eric G: Okay. So just to orient you on the page opco from Domo, this column, Domo data and the four data points I'm spot checking even though there's a lot more than this are just actual operating profit, budget, operating, profit, networking, capital, actuals, and netwhip actuals. And then I've got the financial pack here in excel. In theory. These things should all tie one for one. And then I've got the variance between the two. You can see like I don't know how or why this would be the case, but there are some, very small variances. This is June by the way for all of the opcos, but like rounds to zero effectively except for Texas chiller, which is still small TCS, but I couldn't quite tie that one out. And I'm not sure why Brian and I think that one is related to like… needing a flag in Domo that automatically picks up all locations. So, boo, I don't know if that's possible, but we think that some of the new TCS locations are getting excluded just because they haven't been manually like kind of checked in the Domo data… set. But tell me if you think that makes sense or not that.
Vu N: Makes sense.
Eric G: Okay. Is it possible to add logic that just includes all locations for every opco, or does that break something else?
Vu N: It doesn't break, it, doesn't break anything. It's just pretty simple.
Eric G: Okay.
Brian W: Great. And just to build on that, I don't think it'll help with hvac, next year as well because they're budgeting, you know, at the southeast southwest, whatever their like other locations are that they're not reporting on right now, but they will budget that way.
Eric G: Yep. Good call. Okay. So we can see.
Brian W: Anyone else who has new locations next year?
Eric G: Yeah, exactly. We'll always be adding locations. So, yeah, it makes sense to add that. I think so we'll fix that. Hopefully this will end up to zero… budget. I don't know. I haven't dug into it a lot to be honest. There's a big variance here for modern, not even big but material variance here for modern haven't. Dug into why that might be could be related or not. I'm not sure. But also pretty small in the grand scheme of things. The two columns are really like one big one that I can't seem to tie out the excel to our Domo dashboard, our networking capital, it's really two companies, three and then netwhip ties out exactly to the dollar, which is awesome except for aircomfort. So I'm thinking there must be something about aircomfort… the issues we were running into Tustin, Vu. I know that like they have all these problems with their books like their accrual books and their historical books and like, what should we include? What should we exclude? So that could be driving some of the variance there. Brian and I did go. So like maybe let's come back to that.

John H: Man.

Juliana J: Yes, yes, we can hear you. Can you hear us?
John H: Yeah, we can.
Juliana J: Okay, awesome. Cool. We wanted to go over kind of in more detail what we talked about with Bobby the last time. And then I know we have Jason here as well. So Nick and I can do really quick introductions and John as well. Maybe. So Jason kind of knows who we are and what we're doing here. And then we can dive in. Does that sound good to everyone? Yep? I just need to be out of here by like 945. Okay, cool. We'll speed through then. That is good to know. So, Jason, hi, I'm Juliana, I'm a project manager here at Domo. I work with our consulting team and help drive project success and coordinate and all that fun stuff. I'll hand it over to Nick.
Nik K: I'm Nick Kumar, I'm a principal technical consultant at Domo, been here about six years total with the platform and I look at more of the data ingestion, automating your data feeds and any transformations to get it ready for reporting.
Juliana J: And then John is in office today with, I believe Katie and Bobby are there, right?
John H: Yes, yep. That's correct.
Juliana J: All right.
Jason N: Cool. Just so you guys know, I'm one of the sales managers and also a brand manager at hmy. So Bobby and I work together. He handles kind of the half of the team and I handle the other half of the team. We're a sales organization obviously. So sales is very important to our organization as it is most. So Bobby and I are kind of like, I guess the lead for the sales team. And then we work very closely with marketing and business development and all the work that they're doing. So, I know Rachel and Katie have really had the lead and they've been telling me about Domo for man. I feel like over a year, so excited to see what you guys can do.
Juliana J: Yeah, awesome. We're looking forward to today's, discussion and continuing figuring out how we can help. So with that, I'll bring up, we have… so we put together kind of some of the things that we had talked about the last time with Bobby that we just want to confirm some details on and make sure that we're thinking the same direction as you guys. So, I know the first couple things that we talked about with Bobby were the, so it was the admin report, I believe. And then the sold report and those are both really manual processes right now, right? The data is being entered in super manually and shared out manually, right? And we were looking to maybe get that data into Domo and populate that in a dashboard. Does that sound correct? Team? Yes. Okay. All right. So I wanted to start with kind of who's doing this right now and where's the data coming from to populate these reports… and the, who can be a group of people. It can be one person, whoever is responsible for that.
Admin: So right now it's done by Laura, which is kind of like our business manager and it's very slow and there's actually two. I just found out but there's two deal boards. There is a deal board that the general, everybody can see. And then there's a deal board that's called the admin deal board. The admin deal board puts names to deals. So we have the name of the buyer, the seller and stuff. So that's kind of sensitive information that we don't want all the brokers to see. But in my, from what I see and I track both, the admin one is slower than the brokerage one. From what I see, I don't know and I've been meaning to ask her why sometimes it takes a little bit longer to see the deals coming in the admin. So I still work off of the brokerage which in my opinion has the most up to date information. Rachel. I thought it was the other way around. I thought the admin one was more accurate.

Scott T: Doing well. Still trying to recover from the nice day off?
Aisha A: Same here. Did you do any weekend projects?
Scott T: No, just, I don't know. I had a sick kiddo last week and then my other kid got sick over the weekend. So, it was just kind of like deep cleaning the whole house if that counts as a project. But that's.
Aisha A: fine. That was exactly my whole weekend too. Oh, no, exactly that yep.
Kevin H: Yeah, we had some fall cleaning.

Aisha A: I've been taking vitamin D and zinc pretty much religiously and praying that works.
Scott T: Yeah, for sure.
Aisha A: I don't think Ed will be joining today. Are we waiting on anyone?
Kevin H: So, I do have a confirmation that JL should be joining the meeting today. I gave them the link. So I gave them the link to the meeting, but after I gave them the link, I have not heard any additional follow up. So they may or may not be joining us today.
Aisha A: No worries. Kevin, did you that meeting with the nursing team? Was that this week or was that last week?
Kevin H: That was last week for the future, I guess, dashboard vision.
Aisha A: How did that one go?
Kevin H: Yeah. So let me get my notes from that pulled up. I will say that I, with my best attempts at the very solid questioning that you guys gave me, I was hard pressed to pull, let's… say hard info, hard data from them. So I didn't get any, hey, you know, this number, this percentage increase would be valuable for us to see more of the hard data like that was a little bit more difficult to pull out. They did express interest in having those type of alerting capabilities. But when it came to, hey, what should these numbers or what should this baseline number be? They didn't really have an answer for that. Just yet. I did mention that it may be valuable for us to have a discovery call with some of the shift leads. And they were open to that. They also were interested in seeing a Domo stats dashboard to show user activity of who's accessing the dashboard. That is something that they would be interested in. And let's see other than that, they gave me a couple additional action items that they would have liked to see in the falls dashboard. But that's really all that came out of that meeting. Now, I will say we do have a bi weekly cadence set up for us to touch base on any new action items that they want.
Scott T: Yeah, that's great.
Kevin H: Yeah, that was essentially what I got out of the meeting. There are a couple new items that they would like to see added to the falls tracker dashboard, but those are honestly pretty routine and straightforward. Now, I do see a potential use for the AI or for AI in some kind of workflow because they do have something that they're interested in adding to the falls tracker that shows… whether or not the patient was on any psychotropic medication. And then they also want a review showing whether or not there was documentation for that medication as well, which I think that would be where we would get a lot of benefit out of the AI tool because that documentation in PCC or in the ehr that we're using is all free text.
Scott T: Yeah. So just using like a natural language model to pull that out. Yes. Yeah, yeah.
Kevin H: To essentially summarize the data in that free text and probably.
Scott T: Looking for specific drugs.
Kevin H: Or, yeah, exactly. And then output into a very specific template. I'll call it.
Scott T: Yeah.
Kevin H: And that's data you've already got in Domo or not yet? Yes. So that free text data is already in Domo. I don't believe I'll have to double check. I don't believe that is joined to the existing data, but that should be fairly easy to add that into the ETL.
Jenna H: So, Kevin, when you talked with them, I know you had a hard time getting like concrete numbers from them. Did they overall seem receptive though to talking about how… the page is being used and how they want it to be used and things of that nature?
Kevin H: Yeah. So essentially, the way the meeting went was I kind of opened up. I gave them that, you know, essentially. I tried to say, hey, let's stick to the hard data here. Tell me what it is that you don't like what it is that you do? Like, what can we add? And then what numbers are most important here? As in, you know, like we talked about if the data shifts in a certain way, who should be alerted for this kind of thing? And then it was more so of things that they would like to see that were not currently added essentially. And, you know, that's where we, they started talking about the psychotropic medication. Hey, this isn't in here. Currently, there's also a risk management checklist that should happen post fall. And that is another thing that they would like to see added, which again, this will probably be more helpful with an AI tool in the middle somewhere, but there's certain checks that they're looking for, and this is in the PCC data, but it's not a lot of these fields are again, more free text than anything else.
Jenna H: Okay.
Kevin H: Which is why they haven't been implemented to this date. But yes. So they were open to talking about what they wanted to see, but it was more along the lines of, hey, this is what we're doing now and it would be great to add these additional features into our existing dashboard kind of thing that's the direction the conversation went.
Jenna H: Okay. I think that's great. Did you like when you talked to them about how we have these reports built? But we're not seeing a ton of usage.
Kevin H: Right on them. Yeah.
Jenna H: Did they seem surprised?

Good morning.
Brice W: We made it morning.
Phil S: Yes, thank goodness. Awesome man. Well, yeah, I thought it was… or, I don't know. I'm curious, how did you think, you know things went Tuesday morning?
Brice W: I think it went well. The fact that they asked questions was a good sign. Having Mike in there was definitely worth it, I think in my mind because.
Phil S: 100 percent, yeah.
Brice W: Yeah. The questions he asked were things that I never thought about. I could kind of see his head turning a little bit or the wheels turning a little bit about budgets… and costs and trying to get funds and stuff like that. So… I think that it was definitely beneficial to have him there because a, this is kind of his first time seeing it. He's relatively new to home depot. So having really a fresh set of eyes looking at this thing was good.
Phil S: So, oh, yeah, totally agree. It was like, yeah, Mike's style is a salesperson's dream, right? Because he's asking like, I mean, all of the exact kind of questions that, you know, inevitably you and I are going to have to answer, you know, if this gets done or not. And like, yeah, just, I actually just listened to the call fully. Again. I went through, we use this tool called Gong. So I go through it's. Got all the transcript and everything. I sent that out as like a follow up, you know, to everybody. But I thought it would also be a good idea just to, and Mike did bring this up too of like, hey, let's really just kind of pick out each one of those different questions that he had. And, you know, I'll put together answers for him. So I was, as I was prepping for you and I to chat. I'm like, I don't know if we can do all this in 30 minutes. So we probably will have to schedule more time, you know, like next week.
Brice W: I don't have anything after this either. So, like if we run over a few minutes, it's okay.
Phil S: Okay. I might, I have something but then maybe we can hop back on in a little bit after, but yeah, that's kind of what I was putting together. I'll make this prettier, but I wanted to just capture and this is what I did. I just went through the whole like transcript and I kind of paraphrased some of it to make it more in question format. But like these are all of, you know, Mike's open questions that he's got and I think he laid it out, you know, really well of all right, you know, this is what I'm going to need, you know, in order to go, get this approved, right? And then what I also put together and I'll need again mostly I'll need your help and I just kind of took the liberty of making some assumptions on just different things that I separated out into like hard costs for example, like limsey, right? And then productivity, you know, trying to help put all this together and then risk mitigation or quality of work is kind of the term you know, that Mike had used and just kind of, you know, going through these questions and, you know, I want to get like your ideas as well about all right, how do we start to whittle this down? I know we don't want to send like, you know, something that's too intensive, right? Sometimes less is more but like what are the things that we think are really going to speak to Mike? And, you know, the overall value. So, and I see we've got Dan on too. I asked Dan to join, you know, Bryce, who you met too to just help like with the strategy of this. He's done a lot more of these than I have of just kind of putting together a whole, you know, business value assessment. So Dan will be in the background helping us too.
Brice W: Sounds good.
Phil S: Cool. Well, I also wanted to ask because Jeff had brought up that there was like kind of a slide deck being formulated as well for Jose. Is there anything already that you've got that has been put together around, you know, just the overall, I guess like business value of this?
Brice W: No. Okay. Where we're kind of at now, is we're still evaluating different platforms? Like Jose's big thing is what buckets do I have money in versus what buckets don't? I, from a budgeting standpoint… because there's also the real pool of they got approval for this year to do the PLM. So that's a pretty big ask from the company from our group. So, he was trying to figure out where, you know, what's the path of least resistance for that next bucket of money for whoever it is that runs this test management system. So that's kind of the big thing he's running through right now is still just trying to figure out like, okay, what budget is this going to come from? Regardless of who does it?
Phil S: So, yeah, and we'll like we did last time, you know, that we'll work with you on budgets and also like payment, you know, we'd like we moved it in the next fiscal year and stuff like that. We want to get creative in making this work. So, I guess maybe the best place to start and then also like again, so much to get through is I did, Mike brought up a lot about like, hey, let's try to be transparent and like what are we driving toward in a milestone way? I know you and I have looked at this before but this is just kind of, you know, like the customer engagement model that Mike was like kind of how I'm thinking about it of like, you know, we were on site in June. We've gone through interviewed SPS asp team, you know, had the initial like, you know, SW, delivery kind of where I see us in the schedule. And then what I'd love to get, you know, kind of your guidance and just collaborate on is like, well, what all do we need to get, to get to signatures on our side? We are transparently, you know, pushing towards like October seventeenth where we can, you know, get through legal, get through it, which hopefully is something that's easier for you and me knock on wood than last year, you know, because we've done it with the same teams but that's sort of, you know, also something we want to, you know, work together in building out. But maybe the best place to start is like on the hard cost side because that was one of Mike's first questions is like, how are you positioning yourselves Domo? Like are you guys replacing limsey? Are you replacing the PLM?

Ashli M: We had good weather and it was just like, okay, I can do this. I can open the windows. It was good.
Juliana J: Where are you located again?
Ashli M: Yeah, Indiana, north of Indianapolis?
Juliana J: Okay. I'm sorry, I'm going to stop asking. I know I've asked you that probably three times now.
Ashli M: That's all right.
Juliana J: All right. Are we waiting for anybody else on your end or is it just going to be you today?
Ashli M: Mackenzie has another meeting so she may join in the latter part. I know we're only at a half hour today, but Brian should be joining. Okay, we can go ahead and get started just because of time that's fine because you're recording it, and then we'll be able to go from there.
Juliana J: Yeah, absolutely. We wanted to cover you sent over an email with some awesome questions. I know the team was reviewing that a bit, so we can definitely start there and that should probably fill our 30 minutes slot today. Yeah, we can start there, Nick. I know you were reviewing that email this morning. Did you want to start with the first question and just go down?
Nik K: Yeah, if you don't mind, I can pull up my screen or if you want to, I think the ETL you shared might be a good place to start but really just wanted to understand what you're trying to trigger and just walking through the settings, I think you've tried a few, but I wasn't able to see any problems.
Ashli M: Yeah, let me find a good one. So, I guess.
Nik K: I.
Ashli M: mean, I understand the premise of the triggers and I mean, we have several in place that are working. I guess the part that ends up happening is that then there is data that like from workbench doesn't update every day, right? So, we have in our core system tables that are about persons that we have in our membership and organizations that we have in our membership. So we're bringing those objects in workbench. But sometimes the organizational table there's not a new organization. So it has zero updated rows. So that data set doesn't update. So it's then not like the trigger doesn't run. You see what I'm saying?
Nik K: Okay. And.
Ashli M: So, I don't know if it's better practice to try to do something in workbench that would force it to update so that it would log an update so that it would trigger. Yeah, those are the ones.
Nik K: So you have these three and I noticed like two of them updated two days ago. One of them updated just yesterday or maybe even today.
Ashli M: The member attributes, I manually updated it this morning. So if we can drill through that one that's probably the one that doesn't… there are some address tables that basically don't get updated all the time because there's not new data into them. So in the Domo workbench it'll say, you know, no rows are updated. And so then it doesn't update the data set. So we're just trying to understand what the best scenario is to.
Nik K: Get those.
Ashli M: Does that make sense?
Nik K: Yes, yeah, absolutely. And so you have these three set up but because these two never really updated, this one doesn't know to run, right?
Ashli M: In that case that you have up there, yeah, that's probably.
Nik K: So in this case, because you have those infrequently used tables, because if I go look at one of these, right? Like this says two days ago, but workbench probably tried to run it and there was nothing to update, right? That's what you're saying, right?
Ashli M: Yeah, because it's the weekend. We only have a batch in the weekend.
Nik K: But in this case, where's the workbench job, so. Okay. Yeah. So this one didn't really run. Yeah, I mean, it ran, but there was nothing. Okay. So that's actually weird. I thought this was fixed… in that. Hold on. Let me check the other one. Okay? So both of these ran, but this ETL? Okay. So I think in this case, what we would do is and it depends on the complexity, right? But the approach that you can take here is to say, if, you know, your address tables aren't updating as often, but they could update right between your runs. Let's say for this one… I'm just going to pick one hypothetically, right? Let's say this updates every day, but this might update every week or something, right? But you still want to check because it's very ad hoc. So in that case, what you can set it up to do is from workbench ensure that the timing of their updates is such that this always updates before, right? So maybe set this to like an hour or 40 minutes before. And then whenever this runs, you're still triggering on any one of these, but you don't put this condition here.
Ashli M: The second one? Okay. Yeah.
Nik K: Because it wouldn't necessarily be true every time, right? So we're.
Ashli M: really only setting it on when the dataset updates that we know is the last one that's updating and the scheduled one?
Nik K: Correct. Yeah. The last one that updates. Yeah. So, and that can work where you have, you know, there's only three here but already this grows in complexity because, you know, this one has two upstream. Now, how do you set those? So there's limits to how far you can take that… the other is.
Ashli M: And I kind of thought that was what you would be saying. I just wasn't sure if there ",Consumption Pricing Model,122200.0,Corporate,BEACONCU.ORG,2,Financial Services,193,$25M to <$50M,Renewal,Blank,2: Determine Needs,Kate Kranz,2026-04-30,2023-04-25,2023-04-25,,,,,,0015w00002hvarUAAQ

Shane W: Good news on the name… transition, right? Yep, it's moving. And then I know you sent me an email earlier today. I apologize. I've been trying to juggle… yeah, or was it yesterday that you sent it to me? I don't know.
Jesse M: It's all good… support's staying on top of everything. I think we're good. Okay. They're gonna give me some information… but we've got, I just told the Gallagher guys on our side that if sso is down for a few days over the weekend, it's not gonna be a big deal. So, they scheduled all the work on our side for Tuesday next… week.
Shane W: Okay.
Jesse M: And so they'll set up a meeting. I'll forward it to you guys. It's at two 30 central. And then whoever can… be on it from your side, like the lady that stepped in and told us everything that was broken. Someone just needs to step them through the right configuration stuff and they should be good.
Shane W: I will try to get mom and dad to join us again on Tuesday and see, and you said Tuesday at two 30?
Jesse M: Two 30, but if we move that around, we can try to coordinate a little bit.
Shane W: Yeah, I'll try to put some time on her calendar right now and see if she can join us to help us.

We'll see sometimes connections… are iffy sometimes audio works, but there's no way I'm going to get video working on that call but we'll see how it goes.
Shane W: Okay. So we'll do, so. It's the night, at two 30 central, we're going to have a call and we'll walk through and get the final pieces figured out with. And, and at that time, the new name will be, the account that, your instance should be renamed and then we'll just get, the single sign on part figured out.
Jesse M: Yep. And that should be, that should be all of it. And then we can, then we can just start playing around with, building some cool stuff, and getting users addicted.
Shane W: Awesome. That's what I want to hear. So, let's get this wrapped up and then we'll move on to the real value.
Jesse M: And then on that note, I invited lion, who's on the call today. He is heading up, all the data related stuff for our programs division.
Shane W: Okay.
Jesse M: And they are going to be using businessobjects. A lot more than well… I should say they're going to be using businessobjects a lot more earlier than the rest of RPS, just because of the state of the data and how disparate it is and everywhere they're going to be grabbing it from. And so, we think we found a use case, for… workflow. Okay? Maybe because they want to build some automation around collecting information, maybe from a network drive, right? And then… ideally creating, some data sets or loading it into Domo from there. And then, and then creating some kind of an archive process as well, for the older data files. And so we just need to know, what we can kind of play around with Domo, to make that work. And what we're going to have to do outside of Domo?
Shane W: Yeah. Yeah, lion, if you have more detail on like, what you're hoping to do with that, and some of the details, then we can kind of walk through that. But I mean, if you're pulling, if you're going to push data from like your network into Domo, we're going to probably need to set up a workbench that can actually kind of sit behind the firewall, and push, that data into Domo. And that's fairly simple.
Ankit S: To.
Jesse M: yeah, that's set up already, I think.
Shane W: Oh, perfect. Well, that, that's awesome. If that's set up, then we can just push the data in and then, and then go from there in terms, of, if we need to have a workflow or some other automation process, to do, what you guys, are wanting to do.
Lion M: Yeah, I think, Domo certainly has the ability to, to like pull in a file, right? It's the archival process, that I'm more concerned about. Okay. So, it may make sense to have like a little mini, you know, ssrs package that just loads that into a database and like, keeps a history of it, you know, pushes the file to an archival spot and can keep that sort of transactional history. But maybe Domo has something, similar, right? Like, so, if you think about, okay, here's, a monthly report, you want to put that, monthly report into the data, but you'd also like, the previous, you'd like the previous monthly reports, to persist in the data and be accessible as well.
Shane W: Yeah, yeah, we do that quite a bit. I mean, in terms of just like snapshotting, that data and putting it into, you know, depending on the new information. So, snapshot, say, this is the report, this is the data that we use to generate this report or the, and then we snapshot that, and, you know, append it to a data set or, you know, we can put that data anywhere. So, like if you want to store that data in the cloud somewhere, we could push it, into a repository there, or, you know, we could put it anywhere a lot of times. What people will do is they'll have those snapshots and they'll have the reporting, and they'll basically be able to flip through, each month, and essentially what it does, it just filters the data down to, the time period that they want to see, and we can, and it, and all the cards will adjust so, that you can go and look at, that, at… those reports at any time. So, every, you know, well, it defaults to usually the most recent version of the report, but you can always go back and say, I want to see six months ago, what it looked like.
Lion M: Yeah. So, we'll typically want to see like, you know, we'll want to control the valuation date of which report we're looking at, right?

Joseph L: Hey, how's it going?
Juliana J: Going well. How are you, Joe?
Joseph L: I'm doing great.
Juliana J: Good. I think it'll just be Nick and I, from our end today, Brian's on standby in case we need him. And then will Dave be joining today? Do you think, I know he emailed this morning saying that you guys will probably have updates on the data we talked about yesterday?

Juliana J: How's it going?

Dave: that it is. Fall kicked in a hurry.
Juliana J: Yeah. All right. I know Joe mentioned that Cole should be joining so we can give him another minute or two here. There we go. All right, cool. So we have kind of a loose agenda today. I think we wanted to just get updates on the data we talked about yesterday with the finance team. Make sure you guys are good to go, have that data available and maybe just talk about next steps there. And then if there's any follow up from last week's, discussion we had on like overall data architecture too, we can touch on that as well… but we'd love to start with and Nick, did you have anything else you wanted to go over? I saw you come off mute.
Nik K: Oh, no, that's perfect. I was just getting ready for it.
Juliana J: Okay, cool. Yeah. If we want to start if you guys have updates on that data that we talked about yesterday with finance. I think that's a great starting point.
Dave: For the finance side, I think things went pretty well yesterday, just so you know, where we're at Chris from our finance team, got us over the reports they were using on the counterpoint side. And then we got that little sop from Liza and how she's been putting things together or Lisa Joe and I met this morning, kind of got him up to speed on it. We're going to confirm the data sets that are all available and in the system should be able to knock that out by end of week and then figured we'd kind of flip it back to y'all on how we start addressing how we get the notes part of it taken care of.
Nik K: Okay. And then there was also that feed for unapplied payments as well, right?
Dave: Right, which Joe, I don't know if we got anything on that, did we, because that's the one that I think is going to be harder to find is where we just have unapplied payments because most things in the system generate from like what vendor are they applied to?
Joseph L: Yeah. Let me look at what we sent over. I don't think that was in there but I can reach out to get that and also shoot to get that at the data necessary and done by the end of the week.
Dave: Perfect. Yeah, because the other thing we were going to confirm with them, Nick was just if they wanted to keep it as like an iterative data set, you know, I think what they have now in that G sheet is just the fact that, hey, you have to manually pull the data each time or if they were cool with just a refresh and replace each time. So it's always just the most up to date data. I think from what I'd seen, it's mostly the manual pulls and then keeping track of the notes. So it should be able to move into just refresh and replace, but we wanted to confirm that with them.
Nik K: Yeah, yeah. Okay. And just on the unapplied payments if I understood correctly, it was payments will always show up tied to vendors obviously, but it's just not applied to an invoice, right? And so if we can show them, this is the list that needs to be tied to an invoice. They can do that in the ERP.
Dave: Correct. Yeah, I think that's gonna be the issue is just making sure it's associated with the right one, which is something we've got, we see struggles with, across our systems.
Nik K: Yeah, yeah. Okay. And are you comfortable? I guess I didn't I think we very lightly touched on this yesterday, but we are building the, reporting off of existing reports and we're really just cleaning up and essentially formatting it and getting it ready for consumption, right? More so than actually generating the aging based on here's all the transactions here's, the payments and we calculate it. The systems are doing a lot of the heavy lifting for us, right?
Dave: Correct. Yeah. The systems are doing quite a bit of that, I believe. So what we should have is the data set should look fairly close to what they're producing in that final kind of view already.
Nik K: Yeah. Okay. And then, so you're going to do the transformations, get it ready into a card and then we will just help with another piece, right? You don't need any help on all the other stuff?
Dave: I think that kind of hits it Joe, right? And then what we were thinking was just taking a look at like some of the other, you know, what you guys had presented like what are some other data visualization ways we can make this more ingestible for other teams that aren't finance?
Nik K: Yeah. Okay. Yeah. So when you have something kind of transformed and ready to go, then we can start looking at how we visualize on top.
Dave: Yeah, because we figured we could also take care of just merging the nav and the counterpoint data sets as well. So it's all states in one.
Nik K: Yeah, that would be perfect. You're definitely more knowledgeable in those nuances. So that would be great.
Dave: We did confirm a few things too like that conversation came up about mso codes, right? We confirmed that what they're using isn't actually a G sheet. They're using the same thing we use for our sales and purchasing report, where it's a code stored at the item level. So finance has been using that we feel confident in that data. So that should have let us get to some of those other reports that are for the other teams.
Nik K: Okay. Sounds good. So, yeah, I think we'll let your team kind of work through that. Do you think? I mean, I don't want to, you know, rush you guys, but what type of timeline do you think we can check back in on? Are the office hours like a good weekly cadence and we just check in next week?

Javier S: Yeah, that sounds good. I just leave it open just in case, just in case I'm wrong, and you need something from me, but.
Casey D: Oh, one update, we had a small release last week. I'm not sure if you saw this, but some new beta features in magic ETL for transformations the Json expander tile. I don't know if you're keeping track, but a lot of our magic ETL, that whole engine keeps getting more and more enhancements added in terms of different drag and drop tiles, everything from AI to SQL, anything to make your lives easier so that you can simply drag and drop and be done with it. That one's for Json specifically. But I think the two that probably most relevant to you guys would be column masking. I think we talked about this a while ago, Andrew, but that's now GA, for anybody where you can actually redact or hide or cut… short some of the values in those columns that you don't want anybody to.

Living town on Friday for a little bit of time, so.
Ivan S: That's exciting. Is there anywhere in specific that you're going to?
Tom H: Yeah. So we're so, my wife and I are going to be in San Diego and then we're going to yosemite for like five days and then another five. So it'll be a nice fun little fall adventure and then we'll come back just in time for budget season.
Ivan S: Oh, those are always fun.
Tom H: Yeah, yeah, totally.
Ivan S: But at least you get some time off, so that's nice.
Tom H: Yes. And in the meanwhile, I'm going to leave everything in Jesse's very capable hands.
Ivan S: Yeah… I'm not sure if Scott will be able to join. I think he lost internet about a… few minutes ago, so he might not be able to join, but Jenna should be joining any moment now.
Tom H: Okay. And then we are talking like roadmap timelines, correct?
Ivan S: Yeah, she's just going to go over just like overall just roadmap for today.
Tom H: Okay. I'm a little bit under the weather. So, excuse me if I'm not as loquacious as I typically am.
Jenna H: Oh, no. Does that mean I'm not going to get any great analogies today?
Tom H: Maybe maybe not, no, I don't know. It depends. I'm also fighting the city government right now. So, in case I keep looking at my phone that's what's happening?
Jenna H: Oh, no, like for personal reasons.
Tom H: No. My neighborhood crown funded a 5,000 dollar piece of public art that's now getting destroyed by the state. Ooh, because it's ideological or whatever. It's a picture of a butterfly and a mural of a turtle. So I don't know, I guess lots of people get very frustrated… at the divisive nature of a, you know, picture of a swamp, I guess.
Jenna H: Oh, boy.
Tom H: Well, the best part is that it's right in front of a lake. So they're gonna spend thousands of dollars to sandblast it into a lake and pollute it, which I think is very ironic given the environmental theme of the painting.
Jenna H: Ugh, I'm sorry, that is beyond frustrating.
Tom H: It's whatever we have a very servile city government, so.
Jenna H: Well, I don't know if Ivan shared with you, but poor Scott.
Tom H: Yeah, he's got some technical issues right? His.
Jenna H: Lawn company cut his internet.
Tom H: Oh, no. Oh gosh. It's bad enough to cut irrigation, but you hit the internet that's not good.
Jenna H: No. So I guess the internet company said they'd have somebody out within the hour. So he may or may not join in. So what I was, if he's not able to join in today, I kind of wanted to stay more towards like… ideal total Domo vision for greenway and talking a little bit more about the current use cases like I'm in your instance right now and you guys have a ton of stuff in there and I see some of it's labeled like legacy and so kind of understanding… maybe the main use cases that you have happening in your instance right now.
Tom H: And.
Jenna H: then taking it to that like almost like using the adoption engine as your lighthouse project, take it to like, what do we want to do with the legacy pages? How do we want things like that? But also, if you're not feeling great, I don't want to like force you to do a lot of talking because I feel like this would rely recall like require you to do a lot of talking.
Tom H: Yeah. Well, then it's awkward because I'm out of town starting on Friday through the ninth. So there's going to be a little bit of time there's basically two weeks from today is when I come back. Okay? I don't want us to miss kind of an update, on our ongoing cadence just because I'm out.
Jenna H: All right. Yeah. So how about this? Because I don't want to push you too far because I know it's never fun to have a ton of conversations if you're not feeling great… maybe we just try to keep it to half an hour today to kind of get some of like those big blocks. And if you're feeling good and still want to keep going, we can, but if not we can.
Tom H: Yeah, that's fine. Yeah, we can just get started. It's fine.
Jenna H: Just please don't hesitate to say like I gotta go.
Tom H: My day's clean after this. So don't worry. Okay. I can crash at three. It's no worry.
Jenna H: Okay. So what I really would like to start with is your current… use cases that you find that people most go to in your instance and this, could be dashboards. It could be app studio. Are there any workflows? Like, what would you say? The top five things are that people are going to in Domo? And then I just would kind of want to like ask a couple questions about each one.
Tom H: Do you mean top five as in like top five assets like Domo assets, like top five cases? Yeah. Okay.
Jenna H: Yeah. Like what are people really going into the instance?
Tom H: To try and look at and manage? Okay. Yeah. So there's a couple… of different answers because I, what I'm going to do is I'm going to kind of scale it by like usage weighted by like impact and like persona, right? Perfect. Because a view for a sales rep, a view for a CSR is not the same as a view from our CEO.
Jenna H: Exactly. I love this. You get what I'm.
Tom H: looking for. So I'll say that the most important thing is absolutely going to be what's called the operational scorecard that's probably something that you saw with good usage on it. What that page is meant to be is… the tip of a pyramid, right? If you imagine each tranche here being sales marketing operations, et cetera. The scorecard provides the top of that pyramid that we then distribute out to, of course, the executive team on an on demand basis, as well as a subset of our board of directors on a weekly basis. That would probably be number one. Outside of that. There are a… suite. It's hard because a lot of this is separate dashboards that all kind of in conjunction do one thing. So, my first thought was, okay, the sales forecast page is probably one of the next important ones. But the sales forecast page comes in conjunction with like the marketing growth page as they both serve similar purposes for similar people.
Jenna H: Yeah. And I mean we can, that's totally okay, too. And we can kind of talk about each one of those individually and then how they come together. Okay?

How's it going? Hi. Can you guys hear me? Yeah, I can hear you. I said.
Sonja D: Hello, but I was on mute too.
Manya D: How are you guys doing?
Sonja D: Good, good. Been a while, I know.
Manya D: I don't know if Dan gave you the context, but I recently have transferred over from our consulting team to the age team.
Sonja D: Okay.
Manya D: So, I'll be covering for Dan today?
Sonja D: Okay. Did he give you a heads up as to what we might be talking about today a little bit? So.
Manya D: We want to populate a drop down with the values with the data from the data set?
Sonja D: Yeah. Let me share my screen. I'm going to preface this by saying that I have absolutely no business writing HTML, but I am doing my very best to try and get something to work. So, I hate that one. Okay. So, can you see my screen? Yeah. Okay. So I'm just basically attempting to do a data brick with. So this is just a data input, three data inputs. I tried originally to get it so that it referenced the values in a column in the data set as a drop down selection. But that didn't work. So I just went to this to start with. I'm not getting it to work, but I don't know where to start. So let me… let's see. This is, so this is just all the formatting, right? Okay. So this is my data set. And let me just double check that I've got the right id.
Dan H: I see you met, Manya. Sorry, I was a minute late.
Sonja D: That's right? Eight four, four. Oh, my goodness. Sorry, too many things open on the screen. Where was I?
Manya D: You're good?
Sonja D: Eight, four, four. So, yeah. Okay. So I have the right data set… and let's see. So this here is basically, I'm assuming selecting from… a table… basically, this is, I don't know how to go past this. I just want to make sure that I don't have any wrong field names because I changed this.
Manya D: So, it's reading the data, right? We just need to use that data to populate your dropdowns.
Sonja D: Yeah. Well, so right now, yeah. So right now, I could type in like the J code, right? That's what I have it set up to do right now. And like, I don't know, let's just put it.
Manya D: In, when you put it in, is it saving it?
Dan H: I think all she's got so far Manu is from chatgpt, it looks like everything is in the HTML file. I think we've got to move some of that over to the, over to JS. I think we should assume that nothing… is actually working at this point. She doesn't have any of her fields defined or anything in the manifest?
Manya D: Oh, can you Qlik on the manifest?
Dan H: Yeah, got.
Manya D: It.
Sonja D: oh, and so that in the data set idea is not right? So… I'm assuming that would have to match.
Dan H: Yeah. So, the way that these work and Monja can walk you through it, but, the app can only talk to the stuff in Domo that you stipulate in the manifest and chatgpt is going to try to do everything in the HTML, but we're actually going to need to do most of that in the JavaScript where it will. Yeah, but it'll only be able to talk to the fields and the data sets, the collections, all the things that you stipulate on here. So, even now that you've got the data set, you won't even be able to interact with any fields in it until you add the fields that you want the thing to be able to see. So, I would just hit the sync fields button so that they're all there. But, mania's the wizard here. So I can, I'll shut up and let her do her thing. But, I think we're going to need more time than we've got in our half hour today would be my guess.
Sonja D: Okay.
Dan H: But the good news is we got it. So.
Manya D: I would probably want to go over just the basics of procode editor too. So just how you set up the manifest when you're making a new versioning of your app code as well, how the CSS JavaScript, all of those work together. And then there's also other than what chat, the one thing chatgpt will always miss out on is we need a script tag so your code can actually talk to things in Domo. So it can, it knows how to read Domo's dataset or like the user that's interacting with your app or like writing back to Domo. So all of that interaction is in a separate package which we would need to pull in with from inside your HTML. So those are kind of the couple of things that like chatgpt generally would not get right? And the additional things that we just want to make sure it's in your app for it to function, right?
Sonja D: Okay.
Manya D: And to Dan's point, yeah, I don't think we have enough time to… cover that. Maybe like we could do some pieces of it. I could give you like a just a brief intro for code editor and how that works.
Dan H: So, Sonia this gets back to kind of what I was asking you in the email and please… don't take this the wrong way. But obviously, you're not a developer, right? No, I'm not a developer either. I, with the help of people like Manya and AI and Google, you know, futz around and make some things work in here. But is your goal like for Manya to teach you how to, or someone we won't single out Manya but for someone here to teach you how to build pro code apps or do you just want an app built?
Sonja D: I want an app built.
Dan H: Okay. So let's just get someone here to build it for you, right? If your goal is to learn how to build pro code apps, then let's invest the time and energy in teaching you how to build pro code apps. But if your goal is just to have this app, then like we can just have someone here build it for you. Yeah, we can use your ace hours. We just need to know what you need it to do.
Sonja D: Yeah. Okay. So it's a, so ideally, I'd want to have like the J code selected to enter the allowed amount and then enter the quantity on the claim and then calculate basically what the new cost or what the, I should say, what the savings is.
Dan H: And so, is that just basic? Like, so, is the, I guess is the J code, a value that exists in the Domo dataset?
Sonja D: It is, it is in this dataset that I have selected for? Yeah?
Dan H: And then when they do.
Manya D: The calculate, sorry, quick.
Dan H: Question. Yeah, go ahead. Mind you. No, you're good when.

Ivan S: Yeah, I totally understand.
Marcus S: Yeah. How about you?
Ivan S: It's been good. Yeah, this week's, been slower so I've had a lot of more offline time to get response to emails and whatnot. Yeah.
Marcus S: That's always good.
Jenna H: Don't tell me that Ivan, I'll make sure you're nice and busy.
Marcus S: Yeah.
Jenna H: Hi, Marcus. How are you?
Marcus S: I'm doing well. How are you Jenna?
Jenna H: Good. Did, you had some out of office time? Did you do something fun or was it?
Marcus S: Let me see out of office time. The last bit was. So my kids were going back to school at the end of August and so we just took a few days off to kind of, you know, celebrate the end of summer and get them ready for start of school. There's like a first grader and then twins that are in pre K, like their second year of preschool.
Jenna H: Oh, man.
Marcus S: Yeah.
Jenna H: I have a third grader, and then I have a three year old who is like going on 18 right now, yes?
Marcus S: Yep. I get that. Yeah, my four year old daughter who's one of the twins is very much in that vein of just like I'm much older than you'd think that she's much older, the way she talks about everything.
Jenna H: Yep. And dude, the sass.
Marcus S: Yes, exactly. Yes, for sure.
Jenna H: Yeah, perfect. Well, thank you for meeting with us and for being a little bit flexible with the meetings shuffling around Ivan. Do you want to give an update on the marketing data products? And then we can kind of jump into what today is really all about.
Ivan S: Yeah. From the marketing data products side, there isn't like a big update. I'm still working internally to get resourcing. I have it on my to do list to follow up on that. So that's kind of where we're at right now. Hopefully, I can get resourcing by tomorrow so that we can have a knowledge transfer before our call on Tuesday.
Jenna H: So, yeah, what we'll do is the nice thing about the marketing data products is we're going to get that moving. And so that's kind of what Ivan's talking about getting resourcing. So, I know you met Christina when she presented it to the group. So either her or Brian who is the other like marketing subject matter expert on our team that helped build that tool out, they'll be a part of that as well as one of the technical consultants that helped build the pipeline that's part of that data product. And so they'll get the ball rolling for us with that. And then once the data is flowing in, Scott and I can help tailor that more towards what your company needs. But what's really nice about this process is the data product team can work on that while we finish out the roadmap. So we don't have to wait till we present the roadmap to you guys and you sign off on it that this is what we're going to do to get that moving. That way we can get this, get something in your hands and functional super fast.
Marcus S: Great. That's exciting. Yeah. And the timing is good too because we're kind of like entering a bit of a break in our, you know, the marketing rush because it's somewhat housing, you know, especially on the home ownership side is very seasonal. So getting the new tools getting acclimated to them and then fine tuning them in advance of a couple of campaign ideas that we have coming up on the horizon would be really great.
Jenna H: Yeah. When, like speaking of like the rush, when would you say is like the peak? Like when does it start to pick up for you?
Marcus S: Yeah. So I mean, home buying generally goes, you know, there's especially in new england. It's very seasonal, right? So it's like, you know, you kind of get a lull between October through the holidays and into February. It's the it's actually starting a little bit earlier the last few years, but it seems like March, like once people get a feeling of spring coming on, they like to get out there and start, you know, the home buying season back up. So it's usually starting in March and then running through about now, you know, with like it probably peaks in say June or July.
Jenna H: Okay.
Marcus S: Yep. Awesome. Yeah, that's awesome. Yeah. And that's I mean, we try to keep awareness going throughout the year, you know, because, you know, even though people aren't buying homes, our partners who are the professionals who help people buy homes, they're always working, right? So we want to make sure that they have the latest information that they're aware of our programs so that we're not just trying to get them when they're getting busy in March. We're keeping their attention throughout the down, you know, kind of like off peak season.
Jenna H: Yeah, that makes sense. I grew up in Maine and so I'm very familiar with the new england piece.
Marcus S: Yeah.
Jenna H: There's nothing like looking at houses when there's six feet of snow on the ground. Yeah.
Marcus S: Right. Yeah, exactly. Yeah.
Jenna H: Awesome. Okay. So today is really, we've kind of in our prior conversations with the big team, we've kind of talked about how you're using Domo now, how you want to use Domo in the future. This is more… focused on Connecticut housing like strategic goals, business goals as an entity. And when we were trying to have this conversation, they're like you need Marcus, he just worked on the strategic plan and things like that. And so that's kind of what we want to talk about today because ultimately, we want to make sure what's happening in Domo is supporting these goals. That's naturally going to help drive adoption throughout the company and help growth. And also if there isn't anything is currently set up in place, we want to make that a focus in terms of our use cases for the roadmap to give some type of report, feature, functionality, innovation, something that can really support those goals because it's really if you have this great instance built out, but it's not resonating… with the company as a whole. It's probably not going to be sticky, right?

Juliana J: Okay. Awesome. So today, I know we had talked last week about governance being a high priority specifically with permissions roles, grants things like that. So that's what we have prepared to talk about today. Is there anything else that you want to talk through today or is that the main priority still?
Ashli M: Yeah, that's the main piece in terms of understanding, you know, those governance pieces. We did get a really good opportunity to look to walk through the governance app as a team last week. So that helped us to kind of walk through those pieces. But yeah, understanding those roles and those PDP or whatever kind of permissions and understanding that is kind of where we're at today.
Juliana J: Okay. Did you have any questions or anything that came up as you were looking through the governance app that you want us to like save time for at the end or?
Ashli M: There was a little wait, hold on. Sorry, I wasn't trying to leave the meeting. Sorry, I just hit the wrong button. There was a space I noticed that will, I know he's not on here yet, but he got the pages set up but there is still one area where it's like only showing two pages instead of all the pages. I know he was working on stuff like that, but I can wait until next week for when he's on it's not.
Juliana J: Urgent. Yeah, let's save like the last five minutes. And if you just want to show us what you're seeing, we can make sure because I don't think he's going to be able to join today. But if we save like the last five minutes, just show us what you're seeing and I'll send him the recording and let him know the last five minutes is what we need him to look at.
Ashli M: That would be great. Thank you. Okay?
Juliana J: Yeah, awesome. Cool. With that being said, then I think we can jump over to the governance conversation. So I think we'll talk a little bit about like team structures because that's a good kind of introduction to roles and permissions and things like that. So with that, I will hand it over to Brian who has presentation on it.
Brian F: Yeah. Okay. So as I'm bringing this up… keep in mind that what I'm getting ready to what we're going to go through is it's… a general presentation that I've kind of customized a little bit for your situation. So some of it might apply, some of it might not. But it's all good information to know and to keep in the back of your mind as you go on this demo journey anyway.
Ashli M: Great.
Brian F: Bring this up. Yeah, let's try presentation mode and see what happens. All right. So, I think we've probably mentioned a little bit about these roles on and off. So these may sound familiar. For the most part. You're going to have an executive sponsor. You really need an executive sponsor. This is the person your senior executive leader who's going to give you strategic guidance and support demo throughout the whole thing, right? You have your major demo who really owns the implementation of demo and making sure that everything is the administration of it and that sort of thing. You have a data specialist who knows, and it may be one person could be multiple people and we'll get into that. But really your data specialists are the people that know where your data is coming from, knows where all the skeletons are and knows how to make sure all that data is coming in correctly. And then your demo master is more of your analytical person that really is going to be taking that data and turning it into the data story. All right.
Ashli M: Okay. Yeah, that helps.
Brian F: So there's really two main, there's more than two, there's two structures that we talk about that we recommend and we'll get into a third one that we do not recommend. But where you are right now, this I think probably fits you pretty well. It's a centralized location, the centralized team structure where everything is being done by one team. And you're supporting all the other roles around you, right? So, yeah.
Ashli M: Yeah, we're not federated.
Brian F: Yeah. So that's the way and that makes sense. If you have a small, you know, you're just getting started, it actually absolutely makes sense. As you grow, you know, you're going to get to a point where it's hard, like you can't really keep up with it, right? Like you can't keep up with all the demands of all these areas. So, what happens is each one of these icons, I guess I should have pointed that out relates back to the roles in the previous slide. You want to keep that core, your major demo in the middle. So it becomes like your core, the hub is where everything gets administered from and you want to make sure that the instance is clean and make sure that the data is right? And that sort of thing, right? But you're going to have these specialists and your product owners out in each one of the sections, so that's where the content creation actually happens is out into each one of these. And when is the right time to do it? You know, it's really just kind of depends. I think it's for me, it's kind of a feeling like my God, we have all this coming in. We really need to marketing is asking us a lot of questions. Let's get somebody out in that area that can build and we'll just, you know, push the data to them and work with them. And then they're off on their own, right? So, as you like I said, as you grow and you go on this demo journey, you will eventually want to start moving towards this hub and spoke model.
Ashli M: No. And I can see that I met with someone recently over our contact center. And I can see she definitely has an acumen for data, you know. And so it would be, she would probably be an area where, you know, we might create a spoke and so forth for that. But I can see the vision of it in the future. But for right now, yeah, definitely centralized for what we're trying to accomplish in the short term.
Brian F: Yeah. So again, just quick points, you know, centralized group is responsible for ",Consumption Pricing Model,122200.0,Corporate,BEACONCU.ORG,2,Financial Services,193,$25M to <$50M,Renewal,Blank,2: Determine Needs,Kate Kranz,2026-04-30,2023-04-25,2023-04-25,,,,,,0015w00002hvarUAAQ

Aaron T: Youngest graduated this year from college. So, I'm done with being responsible for children. I'm just responsible for young adults. I have two kids, one up in Seattle. I was just up there with her helping her move this past weekend and my youngest was like, hey, I just lost my sublet. What do I do? I'm like, well.
Neil M: Figure it out, you?
Aaron T: Got to bet here. He's going to couch surf temporarily while he figures out I.
Neil M: Was having this conversation last night with friends. We've all got kids in college now, and it's just that having them figure out how to deal with their own, you know, my wife's like, it's not that clean. I'm like it's fine. It's college, you know, let them suffer a little bit. So they appreciate things later. Yeah. Hey, Carl.
Aaron T: Neil, how many kids do you have in college?
Neil M: I just have the one. Yeah, I know I'm all in on one kid, one kid, one college bill. So, I'm not naive to think that when he's done, I'm done, but it's nice to think that when he graduates, I can relax a little bit, but he's just at chico state. So it's not like crazy like, you know, out of state stuff, but it's all expensive.
Aaron T: Yeah.
Neil M: Hey, I appreciate you jumping on. I know you've been traveling a lot. I feel like I've been traveling a lot too. So I appreciate it's tough to get time on calendar, but hopefully you're is it all work travel you've had or did you get some vacation time?
Aaron T: I don't know what a vacation is anymore. Really. I'll work all the time.
Neil M: That's not good man. Well, now, the kid's out of college, you can start planning some stuff.
Aaron T: I'm trying.
Neil M: You can try… do you want to jump into the main course or do you want to? Yes, please?
Aaron T: I've got the one year and two year slide up on my side just kind of reminding myself of what you guys had suggested might be a starting point?
Neil M: Yeah. Let me, and this is, am I sharing my screen? I don't know why that's so small. Hang on… that's better. The math is, it's not precise. It's kind of hard to do the math until I go into actually creating the quote, but I, it's pretty close. But what I want to do is just kind of share, you know, directionally what we're talking about, right? And it's a little nuanced just because the trend of where you're going with credits in talking with Kyle over the last, you know, few months, you know, the trend of where you're going to end up isn't I think where Kyle wants it to be. So, I just took that 750 number Kyle that you shared a month back as kind of, the ideal final resting point for the number of credits you need. But if that's changed, let me know. But that was, I wasn't using the trend of current state just like where it should be going into next year. Is that fair?
Kyle G: Yeah, that, yeah. So we're in a spot where we've been making kind of incremental fruit moves with our optimization. Yeah. And yeah, so, I think that this 750,000 credits number that, I kind of pitched many moons ago was in… a certain sense, you know, a bit arbitrary but methodical where, you know, it's… about a 30 percent reduction on kind of, where we're currently running at. Yeah.
Neil M: And, and,
Kyle G: and the goal, which is to me like an attainable goal for or not goal but level?
Aaron T: For.
Kyle G: kind of balancing, I think.
Neil M: The, the mindset here is like, we didn't want to use this one point three number because that would just blow up the model, right? And knowing that you're trying to reduce it by 30 percent, it just that 750 number's good. It doesn't mean you have to stick to 750. But obviously, it's we just want to have something from a budgetary standpoint that kind of seems realistic, right?
Kyle G: So, yeah, it's the sort of like, the general guesstimate number, that we, where it's.
Neil M: An idea that gives you, some wiggle room, but.
Kyle G: Yeah, similar to kind of, you know, last year, where, you know, we, where there's this new, you know, kind of cost model. We want to be able to balance, the sort of maintenance work, and the really the credit reduction with like net new, you know, feature development in Domo?
Neil M: Yeah, yeah.
Kyle G: Right. And so, and so, yeah, like I think Aaron and I kind of viewed this next, contract as effectively a continuation of what we did last year, with the big variable being we just, we're going to ask for significantly fewer credits, you know, half the credits that we did last year, for hopefully the same price.
Neil M: So, all right. So let's jump into that then. So the two options that, I think I gave some preamble in the email I sent you, Aaron. But so one and two is your, you know, reading through this well, I'll go into a little bit more detail. But the two gives us the big lever of kind of spreading that cost out because really what we're doing is trying to add 175,000 credits without you paying for 175,000 credits in the first year, right? So, but if, you know, we did have to stick to a one year, then, you know, the current renewal pricing is five 30. I just simply took the increase of credits. We did apply a slight reduction cost per credit, which is nice, but it is a pretty hefty increase of 146 K, right to the bottom line, right? Which isn't ideal. That's why when I was saying, hey, can we do a two year? I wanted to try to soften that in a way without removing the capacity for some of the current state and future state stuff that Kyle's talking about. But, you know, there is a one year option. It is just a matter of how many credits do you want? And then adding those in at the cost for credit, right? So the two year I call it a step up, but essentially, like I said, it's just taking the committed spend. So we're still getting to the 750,000 credits, but we're taking that committed spend in year two and giving you the benefit of that in year one.

They also discussed strategies to increase the usage of Domo by the existing customer, including demonstrating Domo's capabilities and integrating it with the customer's Snowflake backend, rather than relying solely on the customer's existing Streamlet application.","Ankit S: yo, what's up, Shane?

Simon N: Doing pretty good.
Ankit S: Awesome. We didn't have a chance to really connect after the news about five star, but that was a roller coaster.
Simon N: Yeah, bummer man.
Ankit S: Punch to the gut, but we had a really good chat with Jonathan Ben and I.
Simon N: Yeah, I listened to that on Gong actually, I caught up. Yeah, it's crazy how positive it was after how negative it started when I got this account. So it's like a bummer because it doesn't help Domo or help any of us. But it was like we're hearing all the right things.
Ankit S: Yeah. The best feedback out of that was just like he really appreciated how tenacious we were about just trying to keep him in the fam, but, you know, it is what it is, but he, wherever he goes, he's like pretty willing to be a champion, a Domo champion there. So hopefully he lands elsewhere soon.
Simon N: Yep. For sure. I'm keeping tabs on his LinkedIn, trying to get that referral.
Ankit S: Yeah. Well, Simon, I know it's been a few weeks since we connected on this and I know there was a misstep on my part with just syncing with Corbin because I misunderstood about their app that they had. I did give Shane a little bit of insight there as well, but I figured it would be good to just get the three of us together. So Shane more specifically can hear more about it and then just how to approach them at the end of this month. And then including that in our roadmap.
Simon N: Yeah, for sure. So, the app, the streamlet app that they built or the app they built using streamlet?
Ankit S: Yeah. And just like,
Simon N: yeah, yeah. And I just want to make sure before I kind of dive in here that we were, that I interpreted what you were saying was the agenda for this next call properly? So, you were saying we were then a demo, something out of that we built out of streamlet?
Shane W: No.
Simon N: Okay. So maybe we just like level set on that because we might actually all be reading from the same sheet of music and I might have just misinterpreted something as on the communication.
Ankit S: Yeah. I thought when we spoke that or what you had corrected me on in an email was that they already have an app built out that we want to embed into Domo. Is that correct?
Simon N: That was my understanding. Okay. So they bought snowflake after they already had Domo for this unstructured data use case. So, they put all this transcript data in snowflake, processed it there, made it machine readable. And then essentially, they built this like natural language app in streamlit, that's pointed at snowflake, all the transcript data where a user can, you know, ask a conversational question and get a response. The issue they've ran into is their users like chatgpt and their users like Domo, it sounds like. But they don't want to go into this other siloed app to have this data experience. And so what they were thinking was, hey, can we embed this app that we already have is in Domo? Was my understanding of what that use case was? And to me, I'm like that's great, right? Like how can we boost adoption of Domo? And also, you know, start to blend their snowflake and Domo architecture together. I was like in my head, I'm like this is the use case is like, because right with Corbin, I've always been like, hey, we can't really nail down like a use case to actually help them with. They just kind of do their own thing and, you know, it is what it is. And so, that was kind of my email. Like I think we should like circle that use case if we can even do that. Like I'm obviously the sales Guy here. So I'm just assuming that we can, but yeah, that was kind of my thoughts on this.
Shane W: Now that's perfect. I think whether it's streamlit. Like if we can embed streamlit, I'll go in and look and see figure out how we can do that if we can just embed it since they've already built it out. But if we can't that's like a great opportunity to use, our own real code editor and build something fairly simple because all the calculations are happening or everything's happening on in snowflake. So, I'm sure that streamlit just is making their quest to snowflake, and then pulling, the data back. So, I think it's probably something very similar that we can do in Domo, to have that interface so that it's in here inside of our platform. What would be nice is if we could also get like some type of a workflow associated with that. So, I mean, just so we're doing something in Domo other than just regurgitating what's coming from snowflake. I'm not trying to take anything away from snowflake. But just the more we can kind of have people using Domo domos tools. I think the stickier, they'll be right, because otherwise they're, they could just take that streamlit and put it into anything. Yeah. And, and, you know, I want them to kind of be somewhat more… entwined in our ecosystem.
Simon N: No, I'm 100 percent line there, Shane. I think that's even a better. I didn't even think about that as a possibility. I was like, hey, why, right? It's it's still snowflake. We're not like gripping or replacing snowflake. Made the app that they're built that they built just replicate that in Domo. And it makes us a lot stickier as a platform the other.
Shane W: Thing too is like they're from what they, it sounded like they weren't real happy with the results that they were getting from snowflake in terms of the AI model that they were using. At least that's what it sounded like. I maybe I'll have to go back and look at the call but it sounded like, they, were less than impressed, with the results, but I'm wondering also if there's opportunity to even and still all the data sits in snowflake, right? But, we do, some sort of a, we use the AI model in Domo, that queries that snowflake data, and gets a r",Consumption Pricing Model,38000.0,Corporate,CORBINADVISORS.COM,2,Financial Services,22,$5M to <$10M,Renewal,Blank,2: Determine Needs,Doug Bell,2026-03-31,2024-02-01,2024-02-01,,,,,,0015w00002TnWPHAA3

Aishwarya D: Yes, you want to display it like the group getting grouped. So it's just displayed on the first row, right?
Brian W: Yeah. So like, you know, with aircomfort, as an example, I mean, I know this section here is aircomfort. But if I export this to excel, is it possible for every company? Just repeat the company name?
Aishwarya D: Is it okay if I make the change? So it's visible even here?
Brian W: Sorry, I'm not understanding.
Aishwarya D: I can make the change and you'll be seeing it populated on the rows here as well. In the instance Domo instance. Is that okay?
Brian W: For the validation card, I think it's fine. Maybe I'm not sure of like other downstream impacts on.
Aishwarya D: This, I won't be able to customize it as to how it will get exported. So, whatever you see in this, it will export in that fashion. So I can change that in this card to display on every row.
Brian W: Yes, if you could. If you could repeat those.
Aishwarya D: Yeah, yeah. Let me do that.
Brian W: Thank you. It just makes it easier for me to just cut it in excel. So, thank you. Hey Vu.
Vu N: Hey,
Brian W: so, I think maybe agenda for today, I think, thank you to Eric who's not here, but he did do some validations yesterday. I think we go through his questions first and there is a maybe a bigger version question as well, like we're validating against, you know, the excel data, which is what we reported and it's fine. But we need to start thinking about like when we switch over to intact, like how this is going to look because we are going to have to revalidate stuff. Again. Our sage project is making. I would say good progress one in 24 through 20 25, looks pretty good. You know, I pulled that data into workday as well and PL stuff is tying out for the most part. Yeah. Maybe I don't know within the next week or so. We could test this out with intact data and see how it shakes out.

Brian W: You mean like UI, as in maybe it's just my screen, like how this is collapsed and you got to kind of like scroll down a little bit. Is that what you mean by UI, Aishwarya? No.
Aishwarya D: It is, it's right now, auto weight and it's okay. It's all right. It's nothing major. Okay? Because it's the same at my end as well. Like the first card, you only see, you barely see three, two rows populated, which wasn't.
Brian W: really? Yeah, that's exactly what I was referring to. You got to kind of scroll through these cards individually. Yeah. No, I didn't make any changes here.
Vu N: I gave the… gvps access to this, okay?
Brian W: Good call. We need to start looking at it very soon.
Vu N: Hold on. Aish, you want to just lock this dashboard up?
Aishwarya D: Yeah, it would be better if that's all right with you guys?
Vu N: Yeah. Go for it. I'd rather, so we're going to ask the gvps to help with validation. I don't know if Liz shared it. I'm looking… someone might have adjusted it… so that's because I shared it with the gvps. Yeah.
Aishwarya D: That's all right. I'll add owners as you, Brian, and Eric… and I can lock that dashboard. So if you want to make any changes, you can still make them. And the app is also in place. I've just imported it so you should be able to see that I haven't worked on the app at all as we discussed. So it's just, I think finance PPD so there's nothing. It's just importing the cards.
Brian W: Yeah, this is, I mean, we've got to look at it in detail, but this looks great.
Aishwarya D: Yeah, and we can break out those sections in tabs or pages, but I think the app look and feel would be a lot better for.
Brian W: The.
Aishwarya D: end users than a normal dashboard is what I feel.
Vu N: Yep.
Brian W: Cool.
Aishwarya D: Okay. Yeah. Sorry about that. I just wanted to know, if you were making any changes and if you would like us to Qlik on anything anyway?
Brian W: Yeah.

John M: It's called Powell butte?
Sharr J: Okay. It's pretty small.
John M: It's like, yeah, you know, it. Oh, okay. So, most people don't know it because there's like a church, a school and a gas station, and that's it.
Sharr J: So, my wife's just professional work, took her all over rural Oregon. So, like we'd spent time in John day.
John M: Oh,
Sharr J: okay. And enterprise, okay. And then she was doing, she was training, she's a family medicine physician. And so she's residency and then a fellowship.
John M: Okay. Where did she do her residency?
Sharr J: At? Ohsu,
John M: oh, okay. I didn't know if you did it in rural Oregon?
Sharr J: Well, so, what's cool? Is that her program, which is why she was attracted was both. So she actually like spent a significant amount of time. She personally, some of her co, residents were in enterprise, but she was in both ontario for an extended period of time and John day.
John M: Oh, okay. But.
Sharr J: Then we visited, she had some of her colleagues. Those were the three sites, John day.

John M: No, but, you know, I mean, I'm gonna look it up.
Sharr J: So, I grew up in a town called Portland of all places.
John M: Portland, Connecticut.
Sharr J: My wife grew up in a town called east haddam, all like Connecticut river valley. And then, we… her first job at a residency was at university of Virginia. So we moved to charlottesville. I got a job at Uva as well. But then, when we had our second son, like we both were like, this is hard like we should. So, we moved home and we live in a town called old saybrook, which is river valley, but on the long island sound, and.
John M: On the long island sound?
Sharr J: We joined a, again… I went to work for a health system, and she got a job at the same health system, and she, the clinic she was at was in the town we live in now. And so.
John M: The we,

Sharr J: Old, it's called old saybrook?
John M: Old saybrook?

Jenna H: Okay, great. Well, we will, I think Scott is wrapping up another call… yeah. Just going to send him a quick message. Okay. So today is really going to be more about gathering some more information about your use cases and help… us like we got a general overview last time in the last half hour of our kickoff call, but really looking at what other areas of opportunity we have to help impact with the adoption engine program. So it will definitely be more questions and hopefully a lot of open ended questions and some discussions going on. So, please feel free to kind of interject any information that you can share is fantastic anytime you can like screen share to help illustrate what you're talking about is also really helpful for Scott and I to visualize… and my apologies, but I'm trying to remember, did we meet everybody on the last call? Or Andrew? It was just you on the.

Jenna H: Awesome. Nice to meet all of you. And for Marcus, Chelsea Valeria, how can you share a little bit about your Domo knowledge, your experience, how you use Domo today and where you think some areas like what you like about it and where we think some areas of opportunity are for what you're using it for?
Marcus S: Sure. I guess I'll go first, so I primarily use the dashboards that somebody else builds. So usually Andrew will put together these dashboards but some of them are kind of legacy that have been around for a few years that the team updates periodically. And more often than not, I'll get questions from either our CEO or some partners externally asking for a data question. And I'll just kind of jump in and answer the questions as best I can using the dashboards. So I've tinkered around very high level with kind of the inner workings of the tools but not enough to say that I know anything about any of it. So usually if it gets into the weeds on something or if I need something that we don't already have built out, I'll ask Andrew to build it and then go from there.
Jenna H: Perfect. Thank you.
Valeria A: I'll go next because my answer very much mirrors Marcus's answer. I would say that very much high level, I have access to a lot of the dashboards that are already built by our research and data team.

Thomas H: Yeah, it's a pretty good crop of artists. The only thing we need to figure out is like, how are we actually getting there from the hotel? Because our hotel is downtown and it's in piedmont park. So we need to figure out how we're going to get to the park, but I'm sure we'll figure that out. It's not too crazy.
Simeon N: Yeah, cool. Man. That is fun. So, if you're in Tampa, how far I mean, is that something you make a drive to in Atlanta? How far is that?
Thomas H: Yeah, we can make it a drive. I mean, we'll leave around five. We'll get there at like maybe 11 30, maybe midnight or so depending on if we stop or not?
Simeon N: Okay. Yeah.
Thomas H: We've done that before. It's not that bad. I look at like, yeah, this is six and a half hours up by 75. So.
Simeon N: Okay. Yeah. It's like where we live in salt lake, it's like to vegas. So, I mean, depending on how you want to go to or how badly you need to go to vegas, it's like six hours nothing.
Thomas H: Yeah, it's really not that rough.
Simeon N: Yeah. All right.
Thomas H: What we have done before is all the way out to, if you want to type in Ashe county, in your thing, you know, figure out where, trying to see like what is a better city.

Thomas H: Yeah, like sparta, North Carolina, that is probably a good or no, piney creek is where we actually go because, that we've done in one straight shot before, which was insane, but it's doable.

Thomas H: From me? I… want to say 12… hours in the car 11.
Simeon N: Okay. Yeah. Okay. That's a little bit.
Thomas H: That's a little, it's a little bit much there, but.
Simeon N: That's where you, that's where you consider. I know that's kind of how like from Utah from salt lake to California. It's like you're right around that 10 hour mark depending on which part of California, you know, it could be much more, but, yeah, it's that for me, California is like the border of ugh. I don't know if I want to drive.
Thomas H: Yeah, like whenever we do that, we have to stop in Savannah because it's like I don't need to sleep, but I need like a second to not be in this car and like get walk around.
Simeon N: Straighten out your back. Yeah, yeah, sure. Totally agree. That's awesome.
Thomas H: He was just saying away, I don't know if you got a response for this meeting. He responded to me at nine this morning that time worked. So that's when I shot the message to you.
Simeon N: No problem. He accepted the invite but, let's… see. Well, then.
Thomas H: One thing you need to mention what we kind of want for him to jump in is that, I think after all this time, we do have a AI… use case for you guys that we're going to try and build out in Domo because what I'm trying to do is.
Simeon N: Show, are you talking about for the AI agent or for the consulting, the professional service, the AI, an AI agent? Okay, cool. Yeah.
Thomas H: Because what I've kind of been doing is showing like, yeah, not only is it all the reporting and data analysis stuff, it's also like the ability for us to do things in house that like other consulting teams because now everyone has got like an AI wrapper AI agent model that comes with a price tag on it. So, this essentially boils down to like some fuzzy mapping to id some vendor finance stuff, but we can pick that up later.
Simeon N: Okay. Yeah, it looks like Ken just joined, thanks for jumping on this Friday afternoon, Ken. Nice to have you again.
Kdick: Hey, yeah. Sorry, I just got back from getting blood drawn for a surgery on Monday and just everything running long.
Simeon N: Yeah, geez that's, all right. Well, hopefully, it's a safe surgery, hopefully, not anything too daunting, but it's, who knows, sino surgeries are never, you can never know.
Kdick: It's kind of fun. I was, on the weekend moving some big construction stuff for our house project. And, when I went to move at the last step, I picked it up with my bicep and I apparently tore my bicep tendon clean off. Oh God.
Simeon N: That's a pretty nasty one… that's just, I mean, so, I've, had two shoulder surgeries and there was one time where, I mean, initially, they thought it was like a bicep tendon, but, yeah, that one's a, that one's a brutal recovery isn't it?
Kdick: I'm not thinking it's going to be good because they have to put the tendon through the bone and then give me a, like a, a thing that controls how far I can move my arm as the tendon gets used to it.
Simeon N: Oh, my gosh. Well, no more construction activities for you then. That's what it sounds like.

Zachary O: Howdy?
Phil S: How's it going?
Zachary O: I'm okay. I'm a little bit… trying to understand. So, I know why Jason's having the problem and I'm actually, I brought it up, so that I can go through, my… testing and all that stuff. Hey, Jason, hey.
Jason J: See, I took it out last night to see how I ran the thing that was running for an hour and a half, two hours before we talked. Yeah, I thought it was like 12 and 20 minutes. So, I mean, that part's great. Yeah, it's just when I add in that other part that, now, the good news is that I solved the SQL problem.
Zachary O: Okay.
Jason J: Which, holy crap. That was probably one of the weirdest things I've ever seen. It was so deep in the code that, I was half a step away from.
Zachary O: Rewriting the whole.
Jason J: Thing?
Phil S: Oh, wow.
Jason J: Yeah, it was kind of wild.
Phil S: This is a curiosity question. Jason, did you, were you able to like troubleshoot that, with AI or how did you end up solving it headed?
Jason J: Just me ripping it apart. I tried asking gemini a couple times. It's like, hey, why is this duplicating this records and it's like, blah, blah blah.
Phil S: Yeah. Okay. It's not there yet. Yeah.
Zachary O: Yeah. When it, when it starts going, and chewing through and it goes, yeah, I'm just gonna, it's kind of weird. What I did do was, I… had tested, putting your SQL right into a support view.
Jason J: Okay. Yeah, I had problems doing that one day, like I did try that. But like, I had issues getting that to work, I think because of how the SQL was laid out or something.
Zachary O: Yeah, I mean, I did exactly what you did, except I did one, I mean, I'll show, what I did because, you know, as soon as it decides to frickin' load, So, yeah, you can see it's loading.
Jason J: Yeah.
Zachary O: And the view itself, I think I had to add, as to each individual to make sure that everything looked nice and everything looked like, okay. Select… this as, and get my, yeah. So, I just, I added this and this because you had this one in there, and so, I just said, hey, I'm gonna pop those in because it didn't like me not having those. Okay. And… so.
Jason J: It's so weird. I tried to, like, I basically used an exact sequel like that because, you know, it pops up one that's like this as this. And I tried just deleting that and putting in my sequel on a different one and it wasn't much more complicated by that, and it just said no, so, yeah, interesting. I.
Zachary O: Don't know why, but hey, I was able to get it done. Okay? So, and, it loads 10,000 rows, we're good. But when I tried to put it in magic ETL, it doesn't like it.
Jason J: It doesn't surprise me.
Zachary O: Yeah, and I think it has to do with that freshness check because this zero rows is based on the freshness check.
Jason J: Okay.
Zachary O: So, that's where I was looking at. It went? Okay. Yeah, I kinda gotta, and that's why I asked about the freshness check. Now, when I went in, let me go and take a look at the data warehouse. So when I went into this?
Jason J: Yeah, I have been checking at six a. M, because that's when I had everything loading. But then, like I said, I have not been able to find any information on how the cache works. So I didn't know what setting to do, like, I didn't even know what it was caching technically to be able to like. Okay, this is gonna help me or not?
Zachary O: Yeah. I'll be Frank… the data… freshness is. The caching rules, say that. So when you've got this, you've got it set to look daily once per day. Yeah. So, if I were going to cache it, I would probably set it to, hold it for, oh, let's see,
Jason J: Well, so then, I guess there, then what's the point of like not having data caching on if data freshness is refreshing it and it's not caching it at all for any time, what's it doing?
Zachary O: Well, it'll check for updated data at this time every morning, right? If we set it to enable caching and set this to 14 39. It will query it once and we'll ref, then it'll cache that data, drop it the next day.
Jason J: So, okay. I mean, go ahead and put it in, and we'll try it.
Zachary O: Yep. Do a save. So, let me go and. So, it'll go, it'll load the distribution. Now, it won't check until tomorrow.
Jason J: Yeah… but then I should, it should have a row count.
Zachary O: That's that's what the data freshness does is, okay. Yeah. So, going in here, this will go and hold that as you, it's statistical, information and it'll hold it and say, yes, I now have access, I have this, fully locked in and this will update, as will this one. So, this one says zero rows because it's not holding that, as the statistical query.
Jason J: Right. And that's kind of, where I wondered there too is like, okay, because my other ones do show row numbers, but why is that one specifically? Not?
Zachary O: Yeah.
Jason J: That didn't make much sense to me either another way that I did, like, I couldn't kind of figure out like, yeah, how that stuff worked to be able to even try different things with it.
Zachary O: Let's go here. Yeah, but they're all showing like there are some that are showing, but there's others that are all zeros. Right.
Jason J: Like the newer ones I put in are zeros.
Zachary O: Right. So, there's something that happened, between this creation. And so.
Jason J: Like this one, yeah. Like why hasn't that run since August 20 seventh? Like that's? Probably when I created the damn thing.
Zachary O: That's probably a code change, but these ones have, right? Well, these ones probably still, because, let… me go and take a look at this. It was last run four hours ago. Let me go and check it's. Always going to have that, but it's got its rows. Yeah… it's a really good question.
Jason J: Again, because these are all things I was trying to put together when trying to figure out like how to mess with that caching and stuff. And it was like, well, if I've got half of them showing zero, half of them showing that it's like something's caching something I would suppose.
Zachary O: Yeah. You know what? Let me go back? Warehouse, I'm going to go in here.

Katie F: Good afternoon. Hey.
Juliana J: Hi. I feel lucky we get to see you guys a lot this week.
Rachel P: I know… and I have notes. So we're so I'm excited.
Juliana J: John sent me the drawings you guys did. So we're excited.
Rachel P: Could you tell which were my drawings and which were his?
Juliana J: Were yours the better ones?
Rachel P: Good guess.
Juliana J: Yeah, he was like, he told me he hoped I could read his chicken scratch. So he was very.
Rachel P: Helpful. That was a really good meeting. He gave me a lot of insight in just structuring this and yeah, it was, I feel good about it.
Juliana J: Yeah, yeah, definitely. I feel like we all got a lot of ideas and yeah, it'll, be awesome next week. When Brian's back, we'll talk to him about it as well and kind of get a plan put together. I also, I haven't had a chance to talk to John really besides text message since he's traveling, but yeah, we'll all get together next week on our end and come up with a plan. But, yeah, we're really looking forward to that. It was, it was good to talk to Bobby again. And then it was Jason, right?
Rachel P: Yeah.
Juliana J: Okay. Yeah, it was good to meet him too. Yeah. So, they have a lot of data that they can do a lot with in sales. So, yes.
Rachel P: It'll be good. It'll be it'll, be good for us. Yeah. So what's on the agenda for today then?
Juliana J: All right. So we might not need the full hour today, but there's just a few things I wanted to touch on. We wanted to see if there's any updates on boats group connection, Katie? Is it?
Katie F: So, I've… emailed Michael twice since last week and he said he still doesn't have an update from their it team. Nothing moves fast with boats group. So if there's any way that Nick, we can go through the process of like, hey, how do I do this manually? And something can be scraped? I'm all for it because scrolling back to my email chain with our rep at boats group. It's been about a month. So I'm like I have kind of lost hope on them automating the process on their end to send an email. So I'm all ears for whatever we can do on our side if that's possible. So not what we were looking for. But here we are.
Nik K: So, would it be possible for us either for you to create like a service account that we can log into boats group or to download or if you share your credentials that we could go in, log in, Qlik download, right? And then we'll automate those steps. So.
Katie F: Yeah. I'm happy to share my credentials with you is email work for you guys?
Nik K: Yeah. Email's fine.
Rachel P: So, you can automate it by logging into hearst.
Nik K: That is the hope I'll have to do a little bit of digging because it really depends on how they do the authentication, right? If it goes through like a two actually, maybe I should ask you, does it go through two factor authentication? No? Okay.
Rachel P: Just so you know, sometimes you have to Qlik login like three times like the login button. Okay? But if, yeah, if you Qlik login and it doesn't let you in, don't think like the password doesn't work. For some reason. It makes you do that a couple times. Okay?
Nik K: And so what we'll be doing, this will get a little technical. So ignore it, if, you know, if it's not relevant, but we will try when you Qlik login, right? It sends some information to their server, and then a response comes back. And then when you Qlik download, similarly, a request goes to their server. So what I'll be doing is I'll be looking at how those requests are structured. And then we'll have Domo send the request rather than someone logging into a browser and doing it, we're just simulating the same request going to their server.
Rachel P: That sounds awesome.
Nik K: Yeah, if.
Rachel P: you can figure that out that's really cool. That sounds like hacker stuff to me and I love it. Yeah.
Nik K: I mean, let's say ethical hacking. I mean, it's yeah, it's just how networks work, right? Like this is how we, everything in Domo because it's browser based, a lot of our apis are set up exactly the same way a user could Qlik something in Domo or we simulate it, right? And the API can do it so cool.
Rachel P: Okay. So that's positive news.
Nik K: Yeah. So no promises yet. I'll have to see how those calls are structured. And if they are able to be, you know, emulated, and then I'll let you know, so.
Rachel P: Okay, wonderful.
Katie F: Awesome. And I'm gonna send this over to you guys here shortly. That's all I have on boats group. As far as intelligence goes, I did have a call with intelligence. I don't know if it was this week or last week. I think it was this week… and they said that if you are unable to get the data, they actually have expanded their team and have more support now. So they are happy to jump on a call where like Nick, if we can introduce you to their it team if we get to that point. So whatever is going to be most helpful, you let me know.
Nik K: So we might actually be okay on boats group. So I'd gone in last time you'd helped me?
Katie F: Intelligence or?
Nik K: Intelligence. Okay. And so I set up another export. I think I saw the ones before that were set up by Mamta, probably to FTP, right? So I removed all of those. All of them said, failed. So I mean, it doesn't tell you what failed. So I tried recreating the report and I removed certain things that, you know, just did not seem relevant because we walked through last time, what columns you care, about, right? So extra pieces, I added in the message which is their summarization of the call and that flowed through pretty well into Domo with the email connector. Okay, running for the last week. So we've been seeing incrementally rows coming in like 60 Ish rows. I guess. Well, I mean, it kind of does a loop, it pulls the last seven days each time. But at the end of it, you have this log of 6,300 calls that's now been built up based on history and every day it's updating and it seems to be running fine. So I think we're okay here. You know, I'll just really quickly show you all the information, right? So name tracking source, we have the duration.

Scott T: Yeah… I think on the Domo side, we're just waiting for Jenna.

Scott T: Hi, Jenna.
Jenna H: How's it going?
Scott T: Good. I'm just trying to eat my lunch really quickly. So I'm off screen for a bit.
Bridget F: I'm here.
Jenna H: Well, it looks… like Heather messaged and said she's only going to be able to make it for 30 minutes today… and I know, I think Joel had tentatively accepted that. I'm wondering if it would be best to reschedule because what we really wanted to talk about a lot of is the data architecture, components, governance, processes, overall… oneshare health's business goals. I.
Bridget F: Agree. I think without this, well, Heather's here, but without Joel, I do feel like we should probably reschedule.
Jenna H: Yeah. I do think that we kind of need because part of the adoption engine program is using Domo to support oneshare health in total. So like helping the content creator and the data architect. So like Heather, you and understanding the processes and things like that, but then also understanding the business big picture and the goals that oneshare health is working towards and what they want to also see come from their Domo instance, what insights they want to gather, what functionality, what features and things like that.
Heather H: So we don't have that. So just to interject here, but I had a meeting with Jen earlier today about Domo, we were talking through a few things. And so, what I requested and she put out to the leadership team was that we do need to get that feedback because right now we don't have any clear goals of what people want to see. So she is going to round that up from the leadership team. And then I will know because right now it's just been like what I think should be in here and, you know, what I want to see from it, but really no clear feedback. So once we have that we'll be able to relay that to you.
Jenna H: Okay. Yeah, I'm just wondering if I see Joel just also jumped in as well. Yeah, because we want to make sure we understand what… oneshare is hoping for and what they want to see and what functionality will make things better. So we can help execute against those. And if that's not super defined yet, it will definitely be a little difficult, a little tricky. I mean, I would love if Joel, if he has some time here to hear what Joel would like to see happen in his Domo instance and functionalities and features that could help him as well. Hey, Joel, how are.
Joel B: you? Hi guys. I'm probably the least important person here. My team is responsible for some of the data that feeds into Domo but I don't actually use Domo myself on any regular basis. Heather may have already told you but one of the key users was our previous VP of growth who is moved on. And now we have Asia stepping in to fill in as VP of sales. So I think the needs are probably changing right now. But I think big picture what we're looking for is pull… in data from a few different sources and use Domo's ability to slice and dice it to drill down into things that's just one piece of it. The other piece is getting historical trends which is a little trickier. We have data that's been fed in over time for the last few years. Some of that has inaccuracies, some of it's accurate and just being able to visualize that because the other systems we have just show the data as of today. Domo is the only place where we can actually look at historical trends. So I think those are the two features of being able to use Domo's advanced, you know, drill down features and being able to see historical trends over time that we can't get from our upstream systems.
Heather H: I absolutely agree with what Jill's saying and I think with the company having the transition of, you know, adding Asia in and another, you know, person in sales of Michael, was that his name? Michael? Yes my brain. So, so we have two, you know, new VPS in sales and they're going to change stuff plus us getting this conversation going internally to find out what people want to really get that goal I think is going to be the big transition and we'll probably have that in the next couple of weeks. So my goal here is to continue the cleanup aspect of it which I guess have made some good progress, identified some, you know, data that was incorrect on the backend that a team member on the it team was cleaning up. But, you know, we're almost through with the member activity kind of overview cleanup and stuff. So I'd say in the next couple of weeks, we'll have those goals and a lot more clear direction for you. Sorry, we are going through a lot of changes, a lot of things.
Jenna H: I totally get it. And it sounds, you know, I'm sure it's chaotic for everybody to try to figure out new roles, new tools, what get alignment on what people want and that's you know, what we are here to help with. And there's been a lot of advancements in Domo and a lot of functionality that I think we could help incorporate and leverage for you. And I know we're really excited to do that. But I also want to be cognizant of your time as well. And if the team thinks it might be good to let some of the transition pieces happen and then regroup in a couple weeks, we can definitely do that. Asia. Have you used Domo at all? Do you have any questions about Domo that we can answer? I?
Heather H: Have to add her to the system. Okay? She asked me this morning, but I've been on back to backs all day.
Asia P: Yeah, I don't know what we even have yet that I can review. So I don't a little bit, okay?
Heather H: This is, I mean, this is like really just happening all right now. So there's we don't have anything.

It should say ready to prove your knowledge, get certified. And we're going to Qlik that, get certified button. Okay? So, these are our certifications. The first one is more just a visualization. The second one is more on data. So, what I would recommend is to get the last one which is both visualizations and data. And so then you can actually like Qlik through and learn the whole platform as a whole, and don't worry about that price because I have a coupon code that will make it free for you today.
Sang C: Okay. So this one, right?
Bailey F: Yep. So just Qlik major Domo certification. Oh… and then we're going to add it to your cart… go to cart. And then I just put a coupon code in the chat that should make it free. Perfect.
Sang C: Okay.
Bailey F: And we're going to hit that checkout button?
Sang C: What?
Bailey F: And then on the right where it says company name, if you could write telus and put in telus's address, if you don't know what their business address is, we can just Google it for you.
Sang C: Oh, yeah. I don't know. I think I have to Google it. The corporation is 25 york… street.
Bailey F: Perfect.
Sang C: So, what if I cannot, what if I don't finish this certificate? What happens?
Bailey F: Nothing, nothing, you can do the whole certification if you want and brag about it on LinkedIn or wherever you want to talk about it. But, oh, Qlik, I agree. But mainly the point of signing up for this is it's just an easy way to access all of the trainings that are for new users. So if we Qlik start learning now.
Sang C: Okay.
Bailey F: So, this is the whole certification, but you don't have to do all of the lessons because not everyone has a lot of time in their day, which is understandable. So, these are just basically chapters. So, because you're new, I would probably recommend starting with Domo basics and working your way down. Do you know if you're going to be creating any dashboards or putting in any data or are you mainly just looking at the dashboard?
Sang C: Maybe, well, usually, I'll be looking at it, but later I want to create the dashboard for myself, which is possible, right?
Bailey F: Yeah, yeah.
Sang C: At the end, I like to create the dashboard for myself to take a look at it.
Bailey F: Okay. Yeah. You could totally do that. The last part is more creating dashboards. Do you have like an idea in your head of what you want it to do for you?
Sang C: No, I don't have it yet, but.
Bailey F: Okay. That's fine. That's totally fine. So, yeah, I would recommend just starting in the beginning on this one and watching it fro",Consumption Pricing Model,1534381.55,NO ASSIGNED AE,TELUS.COM,11,High Tech,102500,>=$1B,Upsell,Sales,Closed Won,Tim Knight,2025-08-08,2025-06-03,2025-06-04,2025-06-09,2025-06-09,2025-08-05,2025-08-08,,0015000000mHilzAAC

Aishwarya D: Hey, Christine. How are you feeling today?
Kristine F: It's getting a little better each day but a little slow today. Yeah.
Aishwarya D: Resting would help, but you're not doing that?
Kristine F: I know it doesn't allow me to, I tried to this morning a little bit that's why I was trying to miss the call. Yeah, mornings are rougher. So, I was like, I'm just going to lay here a little more. I don't know if you saw my note, but we'll… probably need you to help a little more starting next week.
BrianWilliam 9: Yeah, I saw it. Okay. Thanks.
Kristine F: Hey, Brian.
BrianWilliam 9: Hello?
Kristine F: Hi, Brian.
Aishwarya D: Is Vu joining us today?
BrianWilliam 9: I don't think Eric or Vu will be able to join again and I haven't gotten some responses from Vu yet on some of the data questions that we had from yesterday. They're both at a commercial planning meeting in Chicago.
Aishwarya D: Okay.
BrianWilliam 9: So they'll I think mostly be out of pocket. Hopefully, they should be able to join on our call tomorrow… but we can leave those as open items from yesterday and maybe continue to go through the cards.
Kristine F: Sure.
Aishwarya D: Yep. So, after yesterday's call, we went ahead and added the ttm columns as well as what other changes the previous year of my own columns?
BrianWilliam 9: Yeah.
Aishwarya D: So, yes… that's in place now. Does that look okay to you? And I can bring it up?
BrianWilliam 9: With me. Yeah, I'm going to pull it up too. Just, sorry, I hadn't gotten a chance to look at it this morning. Great. Yeah. So, the prior year for both year to date and employee… we can worry about the conditional formatting later if you did update it great, but I'm not worried about that. Right now. It's just that's just formatting. And I know the open item on the budget on why those two companies were missing for east union, yes, we'll get that figured out. But as long as the numbers that are there are good, I think we can move on to the other two cards or the bottom, the next two on the, yes, yeah, here. Okay? So, we've had some discussions internally on like how we want to show this class. You know, I like how we have revenue broken out, you know, by service, maintenance projects and other. So, I know on the existing powerpoint, we did not have within the same table like the gross margin or gross profit by those categories that's something we'd like to add.
Aishwarya D: So you would want to follow what is in the PPT?
BrianWilliam 9: No, we're going to make changes to what's in the powerpoint all right? It might add some complexity here and hopefully maybe simplify some other things.
Aishwarya D: Just give me a second. I'm opening the powerpoint as well. Yeah. In the meantime, you can pull up and you can walk us through it.
BrianWilliam 9: Yeah… I'll share the same one. Can you see?
Aishwarya D: Yes.
BrianWilliam 9: Okay. So going to the month to date, you know, year over year PL, again, like how we have the revenue broken out by category or class, you know, service, maintenance projects and other, we would like to see gross profit by those same categories immediately below… with the associated gross margin for each.
Aishwarya D: Okay. If you open this in details, the thing is on dashboard, HTML doesn't allow horizontal or vertical scroll. Can you?
BrianWilliam 9: Oh, I see what you're saying?
Aishwarya D: Yeah, because it's a customized table. I see that's why? Okay. We can maybe add a note in the description. This is currently showing dataset or maybe in the title that shows open, Qlik on the card to see more details.
BrianWilliam 9: Okay. Yeah, I like that approach.
Aishwarya D: Yeah. Okay. We can do that.
BrianWilliam 9: Looking at this, okay?
Kristine F: Is the first columns pretty wide? Is there a reason for that?
Aishwarya D: Yeah, it's… I don't know why it's defaulting to that, but when I try to fix the column width, then the trend is also getting cut off. So I'm trying to… yeah, but I kept the UI as our least priority right now, but I know we can definitely make it better. And the heights are also a bit too much so we can make changes there.
Kristine F: Yeah, no, that was good insight though to think about because there can be some gotchas sometimes. So I think it's we don't have to focus on it, but I'm just glad we had that.
Aishwarya D: Discussion. Yeah, yes. Yes, cool.
BrianWilliam 9: So, can I continue to go through our proposed changes here on this one? Sure. And this will work for the year to date and the budget ones as well. So now we have like let me take one step back. We got four cards here for month to date, year to date, for actuals, and then month to date, year to date for budget. So hopefully we, I guess only have to do this once and then just change the time period or version that we're pulling through. So thank you for bringing up the trend stuff. I think we discussed before. Would it be possible just to get rid of like these kind of sparklines? I know we have it in the baseline like powerpoint, but like, I think it adds confusion and maybe more clutter here than what's needed.
Aishwarya D: So you don't want the lines, no?
BrianWilliam 9: No, no. Can you get rid of both of these?
Aishwarya D: Oh, then if we do that, then we can actually give you a different table, maybe a nice pivot table with better formatting. Okay? Because we were not able to create the trend charts within the cells. We went with the HTML approach.
BrianWilliam 9: Gotcha.
Aishwarya D: Yeah. Okay. So we can remove both the columns and I can just have one as a placeholder for now just to see if it looks good to you and we can replicate the changes for the rest.
BrianWilliam 9: Great.
Kristine F: I missed that. Sorry, you're going to remove the trends columns? Yeah.
BrianWilliam 9: Yeah. So, yeah, I know we had like sparklines in our excel version and on the powerpoint, but we don't need it here in Domo?
Kristine F: Oh, that's wonderful. Is that it? Yeah, I think having some of those trends would be good if, you know, if you move some of this to app studio and you can have a trend chart that maybe filters as you're looking at different thi",Consumption Pricing Model,462834.6253846154,Corporate,ASTRASERVICEPARTNERS.COM,2,Professional Services,0,< $5M,Upsell,Blank,Closed Won,Eric Smith,2025-09-21,2025-09-10,2025-09-12,2025-09-12,2025-09-12,2025-09-21,2025-09-21,,0015w00002qxRuTAAU

Alex D: two, it's going to be a similar type of style.
Scott T: Yeah. So, this one, so that one was focused on just showing them one experience.

I believe unless I'm… completely wrong, which sometimes is I get confused sometimes. Hey, Jenna, is this one the one with Perry or Dave? Like the overview one, is this yours or mine? Am I doing stuff with Keaton on this one or is this for you?
Jenna H: I don't know. Yes.
Scott T: Guess we'll see who shows up.
Jenna H: Yeah, I mean, I know, I see Keaton just emailed or emailed us like 15 minutes ago, saying, he had a meeting get put into this time slot. So, I don't know. I don't know if Dave was planning because I know Dave had asked to get this time moved as well originally.
Scott T: I thought this was the one that we put on the calendar for Dave.
Jenna H: Yeah. Well, I know. I haven't scheduled it. I don't and then I think Dave responded asking to adjust the time and I don't know if this was the new time, Dave accepted.

Alex D: heck in your face?
Simeon N: Like maybe my camera's like all frosty. I don't know.
Jenna H: So, we were just saying we're not sure if, anybody from blackstone is going to be joining. Okay, because Keaton emailed about 15 minutes ago, saying that he had another meeting get put into this time slot,
Simeon N: Okay.
Jenna H: So, we'll give it a couple minutes and Ivan is out of office ill today, so.
Simeon N: Okay.
Jenna H: We're not able to like cancel the meeting or anything, but we can have him reschedule… to get something else on the books or, I mean, I think we have our standing meeting Monday anyways,
Simeon N: okay. Yeah, I feel bad for Ivan. I saw the email from matt Walsh over at, groco, And it's funny because the Guy that you're trying to connect with is like my availability is Dutch time. Yeah. Like, what on earth is that? I'm like, I don't know how fun that's going to be for Ivan to find a meeting time for Dutch time?
Jenna H: Yeah, I'm not. Yeah, I'm not sure if like the Dutch time is saying like… that's I don't know we all need some clarification like, is it that?
Simeon N: Time?
Jenna H: In.
Simeon N: that's a first that's the first time I've ever had a Domo meeting need to be scheduled with somebody from that time zone. It's always like India or something like if it's overseas, it's India or occasionally UK, but not very often. But, yeah, if Keaton's not able to make it today, that's fine.
Jenna H: Yeah. Well. Yeah. I guess we can hang. Well, we're at like six minutes so we can hang on for another minute or two. And then I can… just respond to Keaton and say, like, well, we can connect with you on Monday and just confirm like that. Monday time still works for them.
Alex D: Yeah, that's fine. So, it looks like there's only a six hour time shift. So it's not like horrible. Okay. So morning meeting turns into evening meeting for them.
Simeon N: Okay. Yeah, that's manageable.
Scott T: I see two results. One saying it's a seven hour shift and one saying it's six. So something like that.
Alex D: Seven is, I think for central. So, yeah, Scott, for you, it would be seven.
Scott T: Oh, yeah. Yeah, central. I'm sorry. Yeah, yeah.
Alex D: Yeah. And then, yeah. So for salt lake city time, it's eight.
Scott T: Yeah. Well, he's central. Ivan is central.
Alex D: Ivan's central. Okay. Yeah.
Simeon N: Where is he based?
Scott T: Texas?
Simeon N: Texas? All right.
Jenna H: Okey. Dokey well, I will respond to Keaton right now and just say, hey, not a problem. Do we want to keep our Monday meeting and go from there? Yeah, cool. Does that work for everybody?
Simeon N: Yeah, that sounds good.
Jenna H: All righty.
Scott T: I feel like this is starting to stall a bit. They were like the ones that were most gung ho, about us getting started? And now that we're wanting to get started, it's I don't know if they just got other things come up that are more pressing for them, but does that, how do you feel Jenna?
Jenna H: Yeah, but I think that kind of falls in line with their fiscal calendar because based on what Dave is outlining, this is like the last month of their year, right? Because I think their fiscal year goes October first through September thirtieth. Yeah. So they're probably in like the start of the thick of getting ready to wrap up the end of year. So, it's probably more like pushing towards hitting sales goals and things like that right now.
Scott T: The important things.
Dave A: Yeah. There's also, I.
Scott T: Can't remember, yeah, keep the lights on first. Oh, here's, Dave.
Dave A: Bye, Dave. Hey, is Keaton out here?
Jenna H: He just sent an email a little while ago saying he had a meeting get pushed back into this time slot. So I was responding saying like not a problem. We still have our Monday meeting scheduled, our Monday afternoon meeting.
Dave A: Dang. I'm so sorry. I thought Keaton was going to dominate the conversation for five minutes while I finished up 10, oh, I'm so late, I'm sorry. So, well, now I've got you all to myself. This is great. What should we do?
Jenna H: Well, Scott and I had, so we have our different use cases, right? That we've been working on. Yep, and… we, for one of them… was like the user enablement and adoption and training. And so we had started putting together like a wireframe of like what we think the landing page should be for the instance to help any user once they log into Domo, get an idea of what's going on.

Mamta B: Perfect.
Scott T: So, I do have one of… our sandbox kind of subject matter experts joining the call. Her name's Mamta. She also is, she has the advantage of actually working in Utah. So she is, she's trying to get someone from engineering to also join the call, but she should be able to help us out quite a bit. I see she's joining now… hopefully we'll be able to narrow this down a bit as to what's causing the issue. But we did have a conversation last Friday reviewing what was causing it and we made some progress but similar to what you guys were experiencing, I think we cleared some of the errors which were related to beast mode naming, but still other errors were there. So we can get into that in just a minute, but we'll wait for everyone to join the call.
Mamta B: Hello, everyone. Good morning.
Scott T: Good morning, Mamta. Good morning. Thanks for joining.
Mamta B: Yeah, no worries. Anytime. So, as Scott was saying, I'm trying to get some engineers to join in so we can understand what's happening in your instance, and they can listen in firsthand they may not have a solution up front, but… yeah, but at least they should be able to guide us further. Is everyone having a great summer?
Jordan H: It is a good summer. Unfortunately, it's coming to a close too quickly.
Mamta B: Yeah, I'm waiting for it to come to a close. I have two kids so.
Jordan H: I know I've got a few as well, but it's a little sad to see them go.
Mamta B: Then you're a very kind parent. I'm like when can the summer be done?
Jordan H: I know. I always have more hair to pull out so.
Scott T: My issue with summer ending is that then all the activities, I feel like activities pick up even more during the school year. You have to add in drop off and pick up and then going to any after school stuff. I don't know. Sometimes it feels like it gets busier rather than easier.
Mamta B: I do see Joseph and Michael join from our side. They are part of our engineering team, great and work on sandbox. So, Joseph and Michael, thank you so much for joining this call. Appreciate your help here. We have the pack size team on this call and we've been going back and forth offline just to review the issue, but they've not because we got the proxy approval pretty late. We did not get a chance to deep dive further into it, but we still thought we'll have them on this call just to hear what's going on with your instance. So, yeah, if any of you want to start, if you have any support tickets that you can share, I think that will help us out.
Scott T: Yes, I guess that could be a first question is do we actually have you actually opened up a ticket related to the sandbox issue? I'm assuming that there was one, but I looked through.
Jordan H: What?
Scott T: I thought were your full list of support tickets and wasn't able to find one related directly to sandbox. Do you guys have a support ticket open for that?
Jordan H: Sanjeev or bijay? Do we have something there? My original understanding is I sent this to Michelle and she was opening stuff for us, but Sanjeev, I see you unmuted. So.
Sanjeev K: Yeah. So I think I have not opened any tickets. I think the conversation was from you Zoran,
Jordan H: Yeah. So that's my recollection,
Mamta B: we were.
Jordan H: mostly communicating.
Mamta B: Through email.
Jordan H: Yeah. So we sent everything to Michelle and she said she was opening up tickets for this. So if that never happened, then that is a different conversation to have.
Mamta B: Michelle, the CSM, sorry. Yeah. Okay. Got it. Yeah. So the advice and the practice in Domo is basically, we ask the customer to raise a support ticket because if we raise, it goes in a completely different queue, but if it's a customer then it has got a higher priority than us. So we just ask you just have to email at support Domo. Com. So whatever you're sending her, you just send it to support at the rate Domo. Com and a ticket gets opened, we'll get in touch with Michelle just to make sure that those tickets are opened up because without a ticket, our engineering team cannot look into any of the issues. So they'll not be aware of what's causing it. And it leads to frustration, you know, when you don't have a resolution, so we're sorry for that.
Joseph M: Yeah, for this particular issue, since we're in a kind of an escalated situation, I can go ahead and make a placeholder ticket as long as we have the written permission to proxy, I can make that for now, still go through the process and just let support know that we already have like it can be Mamta, you can do this, probably that it can be escalated straight through. But I can do a temporary ticket for now because of kind of what situation we're in as long as we have that written permission to proxy like in an email or whatever that should take care of the trust issues there.
Mamta B: And Joseph, I did send you the approval to proxy. I don't know if you received that or not, but I did send that over, I think yesterday.
Joseph M: Okay. I can.
Mamta B: Look for that. Yeah, yeah.
Scott T: This.
Joseph M: Is pretty much queued up first thing. I'll just start taking like I've already reviewed the logs… and now it's just more. I need to take the logs and then go on and just have a direct look at the repository to start taking a look at what is actually causing the problem and how we can either work around it, fix it or whatever it's gonna take. So.
Mamta B: Yeah, thank you. I appreciate that. Okay. But in general, do you guys wanna just talk about what was happening in the instance?
Jordan H: Sure. Sanjeev, if you wanna kinda walk us through that, and if you wanna share your screen and show what we're going through, that might be helpful just to give some context to the group here.

Good afternoon.
Jesse M: Hello?
Ankit S: All right. It looks like Jesse did accept the invite. So we'll just give him a minute until he joins. Hey, atlas team, would it just be best to just get started without Jesse? And I feel like we have enough folks from your team on this side here to get going?
Jesse M: Sure.
Ankit S: Okay. Alrighty. Well, I know last week, we had an update for the sso and the instance… change. So it was nice to hear that we had that set up, but is there anything else top of mind that we want to discuss before I hand it over to Shane?
Lion M: Yeah. Hey, how's it going? We've got a couple of new users coming in as editors. I don't know if you guys have someone that gives kind of we'll say a demo or overview of those features, but I think that'd be really helpful. We probably have about five users that would be interested in something like that. I don't know if that's something that you guys could set up. But if so, that'd be great.
Shane W: Yeah, for sure. We can get either myself to do that. But we do have like a education team that does regular like trainings and they do them, you know, online and I think that might be something that would be perfect for them.
Lion M: That'd be perfect. Yeah.
Shane W: So, let me Ankit, can you take that as a, to do?
Ankit S: Absolutely. Yeah, I'll get you connected with someone from Zach Cameron's, team. Zach Cameron's our director of education here at Jomo. Yeah.
Lion M: So, any time really in the morning would work great. I think, you know, if we just wanted to schedule it a week or two out. I think any of those times would probably work and get some good interest. So.
Ankit S: Thank you. Absolutely. Yeah. Let me give me like a day just to figure out who he's going to assign to your team for those trainings, and then, yeah, we can get something scheduled and I'll take care of that.
Lion M: Awesome. Thank you.
Ankit S: Yep. My pleasure. Hey,
Jesse M: Jesse? No worries.
Ankit S: Alrighty. Shane, I'll hand it over to you now.
Shane W: Awesome. Thanks. All right. Well, so I mean, I think we made good progress getting the sso set up and the redirect working, which is nice. And Jesse was finished that up, got it while he was on the airplane. We were finishing it up. So it seems like it worked well even in the sky. So that's great. And is there anything else surrounding that? I know we had some issues with Samantha. We had some issues with workbench but that seems to have been resolved, right?
Ankit S: Yep. Everything's.
Lion M: good.
Shane W: Great. So from there, what else is there that's kind of pressing top of mind that we need to get resolved? And if we have any of those, if not, then we could kind of maybe dive into some other projects that you guys are interested in working on?
Jesse M: Yeah, yeah. I think we're ready to go. So we can probably just start breaking… out the different things we're either doing in Domo right now or looking to do in Domo. There are some dependencies with getting data… dialed in and just in there and set up. And when… I say that, for example… we have our main data set pulling in data from aim and we need to align some calculations for how new… policies and renewal policies are kind of calculated across Gallagher so that we can just align with how they do that and follow suit. But I think as soon as that's done, we'll be able to start building out a lot of. Alerts, notifications just around new business that's coming through, recreate some of the reports that are being done outside of Domo and really start to utilize just the… alerting more than anything, right? So that we can start setting up notifications that go out to specific people at specific times when certain things happen. I think RPS hasn't had that anywhere and so that'll be good for them. And then there's I'm kind of tired of waiting for azure… devops to give me a data request process. So I think I'd like to see what we can build inside of Domo. So basically just a request form. I've already got some stuff built and… I've asked Patrick to kind of play with it on our side on manting's team, but he's got a lot of stuff on his plate. So any help we can give him just kind of setting the stuff up would be good. So request form, right? We tie it to a… page that we can kind of just publish somewhere out on the internet site and put links on our reports, whatever it is, right? Feed them to that spot and let the request come through right to a data set and… maybe even tie it to the tasks inside of Domo. And then… we can play around with some kind of an output that maybe we could try to integrate with azure devops. But if I have to live inside a Domo for that, then I'll just I'll… deal with it.
Shane W: So you're talking about building a form that people can request?
Jesse M: Just data stuff, right? I need help with this report or, yeah… yeah.
Shane W: That'd be pretty straightforward and we could build that pretty quickly, I think and integrate it into some of the other things you guys are doing. And at the very beginning, you kind of talked about… bringing in some data, doing some calculations on it with regarding like new customers, things like that. Is that something that we can help with? Or is that something that you guys are going to be doing on your side?
Jesse M: I think rob, you can handle this. He just has a lot on his plate. So I'm not bugging him about it yet. But I think once we can kind of recreate that calculation that they're using outside of RPS so that we can match to it, we'll be able to start building out a lot more kind of day to day metrics and updates around that data.
Shane W: Nice. Is that data already in Domo? It's just building the calculations.
Jesse M: Yeah. Nice, rob. Have we, is there anything we need to do with that aim data that's in Domo? Is that cleaned up enough to where it matches everything that's in Power BI? Yeah, I mean, it should be the same table. Okay? And then, and then Shane, really, I'd like to start dialing in some of the apps that we've built, and start to, create more of a more of an entry point into Domo, right?

Scott T: Good.
Ivan S: It's Monday. I'm feeling better than Thursday?
Dave A: Yeah. Did you guys get the message that I have to go in 30?
Ivan S: I don't think I got any. No, I don't think I got a message.
Dave A: I was trying to reschedule it and it looked like that. All the other times were like, ugh, that doesn't work for me either, but… yeah, but I do have a meeting here with my new weber boss. So. Okay.
Scott T: All right. Well, we'll try to keep this one short I guess then, so you can prep for that.
Dave A: Thanks. Yeah. How's everything going though?
Scott T: Good, good. We did kind of meet internally a little bit to talk about that new product releases feature that you wanted to bring up. And so admittedly… I just threw something together super fast just to kind of get your initial thoughts on kind of where we might be able to take something cool and it's kind of buggy and glitchy. So, just bear with it. But this is kind of and the names don't even match. But this is kind of what we were thinking in terms of a functionality like this where we could take your dataset, filter it down to like 10 or so products based on whatever filter criteria we set, and then just have this kind of flash through those products. And then we could even have like a description down below about what the product is. And then if they Qlik on it, we could have it, take it to your catalog website. Is this kind of what you're looking for? Or did I miss the mark? Completely? Yeah.
Dave A: I think that the value of taking it out of the catalog that we have today is that catalog can't be sorted or controlled very easily. And so, the value of going here to view some of these things would be, would have a section for griddles, a section for accessories and one for consumables?
Scott T: Yep.
Dave A: And that there would be different ways of like filtering it out to see what we're looking for.
Scott T: Yeah. So I guess, let me just go really quickly to your instance just to like make sure that I'm understanding here… like our thought would have been where's our, this thing. So like, you know, we have these pages here which we could stick with this link where it takes you directly to this catalog. Yeah, or we could change this so that when you Qlik on this, it takes you to like a Domo hosted version of this concept only catalog, right? In terms of like just highlighting the new products, we thought like having this carousel view kind of like right in here like, a small carousel view, that kind of just highlights without forcing someone to Qlik on. Oh, well, what's in pre production or whatever? Like it just kind of highlights like, hey, here's, some new products that have just recently become available. And having something… similar to this obviously branded for blackstone, and much smaller than, the AI built for me here, but something similar to this, that would just rotate through those newest features, those newest products, still giving you the ability to Qlik on the full catalog or just call out the new ones. Is that a… valid thing or no?
Dave A: Yeah. There, there's a lot of items in those. And so, I'm curious like how we decide what shows in the carousel, if it's all of them or just a few of them, and how that's maintained, but.
Scott T: Yeah. So, the original thought that, Keaton shared with us was to go through the items that were in pre sell and so, to just filter it for items that were pre sell and that were not exclusive to a particular store. And then those be the ones that got highlighted. But we can definitely like iterate on that, and, figure out which ones we want to call out. Alex also had a great idea of like including maybe some tabs on this where you could have like show me the griddles, show me the accessories, show me the consumables instead of like having them all on the same carousel and having it switched to three different carousels depending on what you wanted to look at. So, yeah.
Dave A: Yep. That's cool. Okay. Well, I mean, like another idea too. Maybe we.
Scott T: Just kill.
Alex D: The carousel cause, if the functionality is more or less being able to mine the, the, catalog, then I think a carousel is not gonna be very user friendly for like searching and finding things. Yeah. So I was almost thinking too, maybe like some custom search functions that uses some fuzzy matching. So you have like a thing you can type into and say, I'm looking for a specific product or we have like, you know, specific like filterable items where you can say like, oh, I wanna look at, you know, based off the product collection or based off the product group or based off the accessory subcategory or whatever. And you can just search, find what you want and it'll filter the page down with like a list of cards that have like the image of the item and then you can Qlik on it to blow it up or whatever. But I'm thinking more along the lines and Dave, let me know if I'm aligned with you. Basically, you wanna replace the functionality of that catalog and you need to add more to it so that people can more easily get to the products that they're looking for, right? Am I on base there?
Dave A: Yeah. So it's pretty dang close where it is today. The miss is that it's in some random crazy order. Got it. So like I can quickly see 50 items and I can Qlik into them. The step back off that as a carousel would be, I wouldn't be able to quickly see 50 items.
Scott T: Right.
Dave A: And so that feels like a step back there, but then the, seeing it in 50 items is just confusing when it's random, throw it at ya type approach. So.
Scott T: Well, maybe the more just a better search functionality is kind of what you're looking for then. So, I'm glad we had this conversation before I asked Alex to build out the full app. So.
Dave A: The other thing I'm doing as well is I'm trying to get, so it sorts on something. I just don't know what it is. So I challenged Taylor to go into salsify and just create a custom field for sort and see if she could get it to sort in some logical order better than what it's doing today as well.

Scott T: Well, I'm actually in Chicago, so it's night. Okay. Jenna, who will also be joining us is on the east coast. So, okay. Yeah, I think we're just getting off of other calls. So, apologies for being a few minutes late. I was expecting to be the last one joining, but I guess Jenna was tied up as well, so she should be here. No worries. So, if I can.

Andrew B: Morning.
Valeria A: Good morning.
Jenna H: Sorry, I'm a few minutes late. I had another call that was going over. Unfortunately… are… we waiting on anybody else on your side?
Andrew B: No, this is it today. Marcus is out this week, so.
Jenna H: All right. So, what Scott and I really wanted to talk about today was the marketing data products app and getting that up and running, and just finding out the requirements for that because the way it's currently set up, there are certain levels of data and granularity and things that we're looking at. So we want to make sure that what you want to look at and report on is matches that because if that's the case, then we can really get moving with getting that started while we finish flushing out the rest of the roadmap. So we start seeing some of that speed to value. So, does that sound like a good plan? Because I really want to get that ball rolling because I think they budget around like 100 hours of level of effort from the Domo side to get it integrated and connected and everything like that. So I feel like if we can get that started, then we see progress and we can finish flushing out the rest of our use cases for the adoption engine program, but at least we know we want to do that and that's going to be a cornerstone of what we do. So, I'm like why wait, right?
Andrew B: Yeah, I think so. I mean, Valeri and I two weeks ago now started doing some connections here and there, but definitely need some more expertise.
Jenna H: All right… perfect. So, I'm just pulling up some… okay, my notes. So, as Christina showed, when she demoed, it has four primary pages. We have the web paid search, paid social and display… with the web by default. It looks at Google analytics at the session level. Does that feel like what your data is currently coming in as? Do we have Google analytics? We do.
Valeria A: We do have access to Google analytics as far as it being connected to our website? I'm not, I may need some clarification as far as what you mean by session data?
Jenna H: Yeah. So, do we, is it already connected and coming into demo or would that be something that we would need assistance setting up?
Andrew B: I don't believe it's connected yet?
Valeria A: No. Okay. It's separate. Yeah.
Jenna H: Okay. So with Google analytics typically at the session level, it's looking at each user's web session when they come in. And so it's I think that's pretty standard. Scott, have you seen Google analytics data come over in a different capacity?
Scott T: I have not, it's typically, and I don't know their exact, I'd have to do some digging around to find their exact definition of what a session is though, but that's typically how it comes in.
Jenna H: Yeah. There's like a web session id number that's associated with like an IP address coming in and I think usually that… visit has to last a certain amount of time in order for it to count as like a session.
Andrew B: Right? So they can't just like it's like counting, if they spend a reasonable amount of time on one of our pages or something?
Jenna H: Yeah.
Scott T: Yeah. So it looks like, sorry, I just looked it up. It looks like the session will continue until they either exit the page or spend at least 30 minutes of inactivity on a web page. So, but any activities they do within that 30 minutes or whatever is all considered part of that session?
Jenna H: Okay. So we're not connected yet, but you do have access to Google analytics data?
Valeria A: Correct.
Scott T: Okay.
Jenna H: And really, this would this will give you insights into? Like… how long people are engaging on your pages where it could show you like where they're coming from. It could show you what they're doing, like what actions, what links are they clicking on? The most things like that? So you can get a good idea of user behavior by looking at this data in terms of your website and just seeing like, oh, if we move these embedded dashboards up here, maybe then we're going to get some more traction and things like that?
Isabel D: Okay.
Jenna H: And then we… have paid search and by default the data products comes with Google paid search reporting. Brian who helped build this data product, said we could add Bing if it's a priority. And this would come over at like the ad group level. So, do you do any reporting on paid search? Do we need to do reporting on page search? I defer to Isabel and Valeria here again. Oh, Isabel, you're on mute. I'm sorry.
Isabel D: Sorry. So just to, I'm sorry, I'm going to go back to your initial question of the web with Google analytics. So what we're mainly interested in is to definitely track where are the visitors coming from, right? Are they coming from a search? Are they coming directly? So that's something we would definitely want to track which pages they're visiting, which programs they're clicking to. And obviously, we want the duration session on, you know, where they frequent the most because to your point, we will use this information to assess, you know, is this website? Is this something that probably requires more visibility? Should we, you know, put it on top as opposed to the bottom? So in reference to Google analytics, that's what we're mainly concerned because that's how we're going to be able to track most of the outreach that we're doing, and also the marketing, is it really being affected?

She has surgery on Thursday. So we'll know more about recovery times and plans and stuff. But, yeah, it's rough. It was right as competition season started. So, she, you know, works every day in the off season at practice and everything. And then that happens, so.

Doug B: A while, but truthfully I'm not like… I wasn't as diligent about my recovery as I, there was nothing that was driving me to get back, if that makes sense. So, it was just try to get back to whatever it was. If I had something like, if I was doing something competitive, then I'd make it a job to recover, right? It wasn't my priority. So, it was probably a couple years before I felt totally okay, but that's the anomaly because I wasn't working right? As I should have. So.
Trey H: Got it. Okay. Thanks for the insight. I've been asking everybody who's got any experience in it, what their recovery looked like because just, we've been lucky enough to not have to experience this. So, it's kind of new to us. But, yeah.
Doug B: Yeah, I mean, the first couple weeks were really, pretty brutal but, but you kind of figure it out and, yeah.
Trey H: Yeah.
Doug B: I think it's more the mental game probably for her, right? Yeah, like to be able to go back and do another pass, after the fact that first one is going to be really tough. I'm sure.
Trey H: Agreed. Cool. Is Michelle joining or is she just totally gone? She's not even interested in saying goodbye.
Simon N: She's still around. She's actually at the doctor, with, her daughter today. She had, something pop up last minute, so she wasn't able, to jump on. I'll make sure we get her on another one of these calls just to, have a final farewell. But she'll still be around at Domo. So, if you ever need anything from her, we can definitely loop her in, but, you know, wanted to loop in, Doug, really excited to have him as part of the account team for Jr, and we'll give Doug a moment here to introduce himself, maybe just do a quick round of intros and then, touch base on, you know, if you have anything on your Domo to do list and then I just wanted to follow up on what we discussed back in July and just see how things have been progressing. Does that sound like a good agenda here?
Trey H: Works for me?
Simon N: Awesome. All right. Doug, do you want to give a quick intro?

The key highlights were the plan for virtual instructor-led training sessions, the creation of an enablement-related app or dashboard to serve as a resource for users, and the need to align the education and enablement timeline with the rollout timeline to ensure users can apply the learnings right away.","Simon N: hey, Chris. How's it going?
Chris W: Hey, Simon. Good. How are you?
Simon N: Hey, doing pretty good. That was a tough loss for your niners on Sunday?
Chris W: Yeah. Unfortunately already kind of banged up and seems to be the same old story every year now for us.
Simon N: Three and one could be worse.
Chris W: Yeah, it could be worse.
Simon N: Awesome. Well, waiting on my colleague Zach to join, do you know if Nate's going to be hopping on or if it's just going to be us?
Chris W: I'm not sure actually I can ping him.
Simon N: Perfect. Well, Zach just jumped on.
Chris W: I think Nate's actually in another meeting. Okay?
Simon N: No problem. Well, really the scope of today, Chris, I appreciate you making time for us was to revisit the training options discussion that we had back late August. Zach is Domo's director of customer education. I'll give him a chance here to introduce himself, but we were able to catch up and kind of give a little bit of overview of the kind of company wide train the trainer rollout… that you had kind of outlined to us and we're really looking to just have a discussion around that today and further refine what that might look like going over like, hey, this is how I might look for the FP, a group and using the excel plugin and maybe for your team right here, some training on governance as you look to, you know, kind of reroll out Domo or go out at realtruck, so that's kind of the scope of today's call. Does that sound like a good agenda?
Chris W: Yeah, it does.
Simon N: Okay. Perfect. Well, Zach, I'll give you a chance here to introduce yourself and then we can start the conversation and then we'll actually I'll let Chris, you do an intro after that as well?
Zack C: Sweet. That sounds perfect. So, yeah, Zach, Cameron, I'm the director of education for Domo. I've been with Domo for a little over 10 years now and some various capacities, but generally, the role has been making sure customers have what they need to get value out of Domo from a technical standpoint. So that's what my team does now too, and so happy to work with you to try and figure out the best ways to get your team feeling fully enabled and ready to jump in. So we'll work together to figure out what the right type of training and level of depth and all that sort of stuff and craft something that should work for your crew. Okay?
Chris W: Yeah, sounds good. Yeah. And then I'm overseeing the bi team here at realtruck. Been with the company. It'll be five years in December. So a little background for you. There's a lot of anxiety right now. I think from some of our what I'm going to call our legacy users, like last year, it's been about a year and a half. Now the company decided to kind of merge their two bi teams. So we had two internal bi teams focused on different areas of the business. And then we had like a third party analytics offshore company that was doing some stuff as well. They made a decision to consolidate things. Yeah, long story short. We've ended up kind of moving our data warehouse to Google cloud. And then we're going to be rolling out our new bi tool which is going to be in Domo to the business here in the last couple months of the year. So we're in a position where there's a lot of anxiety. The previous oracle analytics environment has been used by sales finance, you know, all of the above on their side.
Zack C: Yeah, they're comfortable with it, right? It's been a lot of change happening here.
Chris W: Yep. So just trying to come up with a way to, I know it's not going to be painless. But I want to show, you know, that we're going out of our way to accommodate everybody and make sure we're trying to do the best we can to transition to a far superior platform. So, yeah, I just wanted to kind of talk through what… some potential like kind of Domo provided trainings might look like and kind of proceed workshops where we, you know, probably do two or three different sessions but, you know, require them per SE, like for folks and then how we can tee up like Nate and his team to, for ongoing support and training as we get into some of the edge cases and get into more power users. But the two main focuses will be, you know, reports that we build and then also like the data set that we, you know, surface for end users, kind of as a self service path and using that connect or the excel connector to get to what they need. Okay?
Zack C: So let me just make sure I follow along. A lot of the focus of this will be rolling us out to a team that has used the oracle reports in the past for getting insights for, you know, taking action for reporting all that sort of thing. It's that same group now that we need to make sure understands how they can leverage domos. There's going to be a focus on consuming content that your team's providing, right? Is a big piece of that. And it sounds like there is an aspect of it that you want to enable them to do some of their own content creation as well, but probably light, right? We're not talking about necessarily having them go through magic ETL or, you know, workflows training or things like that at this point, but more, how could I add my own excel spreadsheet if I want to and maybe do some simple transformations there and build some cards and dashboards off of that? Is that more or less what you're thinking?
Chris W: Yeah, that's fair. I think the content creation piece, you know, to be using just assets that we provide, we do a lot of our heavy lifting and compute and stuff in the warehouse. So there might be any for some basic, you know, beef milk, calculations, things like that. But that would be for probably a subset of users that, you know, can grasp it and handle it.
Zack C: Yeah, that makes sense. Tell me about the size of the user base that you're rolling out to, how many people would be needing that consumer training?
Chris W: Yeah. So, Nate, I don't know, have you looked lately to see how many people we have in there now?
Nate T: We've got like 330 somewhere around there?
Chris W: Yeah. So I could see that growing like even in the 500 range potentially. Yep.

Appu C: Very good. How are you?

Appu C: Yeah, happy Friday to everyone.
Jenna H: How is it up in Canada today?
Appu C: Very good.
John D: Yeah, not too bad. Nice. The weather's great.
Jenna H: Yeah, I'm in North Carolina and it, this happens every year, but I feel like it can't make up its mind yet, what season it is. So, we'll have like a week or two where it's like low seventies and chilly, and then it jumps up this week and it's going to be like 86 and sunny today. Like, how am I supposed to plan for this?
John D: It's just been getting a bit chillier in the morning for us, but in the afternoon, it heats up.
Jenna H: Nice. Do you know if this is going to be the group from kronos' map, planning on attending at all today?
John D: Not too sure. I just know apu and I.
Ivan S: Yeah, matt, I'm seeing that matt accepted the meeting.
Jenna H: Okay.
Ivan S: Maybe we can wait a minute and then get started.
Jenna H: Well, I think actually while we are waiting… for that piece, I was looking at apu, the excel file you sent over on the flower and mother's jobs as well as the final report that's uploaded to sharepoint. And so it comes from the same data source. However, it looks like there's two different tables involved. There's the jobs. And then the work orders, is that correct?
Appu C: That's correct? Yes, just two tables.
Jenna H: Okay. So, right now, from what I see, they're both independent in your instance, correct? You haven't done anything to join them?
Appu C: Usually in our jet report, we will find out the unique identifier field between both the tables and we will try to connect. So, for example, this report, the unique identifier between the work order and the job table is the job number.
Jenna H: Okay. So in order for, so I think in, with the jet reports, how you have them structured in excel, you can call on those two different tables independently, right? Yeah. But here, we need to join them in an ETL so we can visualize data from both tables together. So this doesn't have to be perfect because this is just going to be a working exercise on card building and getting started. But I think maybe if Alex and you guys can walk through doing a simple ETL and also just looking at the data too. Alex, I sent over some screenshots, but what I'd really kind of like to do is just keep the essential columns that we need for this report, like try to keep everything as concise as possible for this exercise. And then if we need to add columns back in later, we can, is that possible?
Alex D: Yeah. Let's do it.
Jenna H: All right. So we'll start with, this is great because you'll see a really simple data flow design with magic ETL and then we'll go into starting to do some of that visualization.
Appu C: Perfect. Just.
Alex D: Give me one sec. I'm setting my screens and I'll go ahead and start sharing here.
Ivan S: There's that. Okay?
Alex D: All right. I'm hoping I'm sharing the right screen. There we go. Okay. So Jenna… I got what you pulled up sent or what you sent pulled up here. So basically the output data set, we want to look something like this, right?
Jenna H: So that's their report right now that is being generated. So if the output data set looks like that, that's perfect. But those are the key columns that we need.
Alex D: Perfect. Okay. So let's start like small scope because what we can do later is we can always add more to the etls. My general kind of philosophy on this is don't try to overcomplicate the etls. Just get what you need to start and then iterate upon that and build them out more and more. If there's more, you know, insights or analysis that you want to do on your data, we can bring in new data sets later. So let's start with the intent that these are the columns that we want to output. And then we just need to figure out or look for the input data sets that can be joined together be formulated out to create this output data set. So I will be honest, I'm not super familiar with your instance. I'm still pretty new at Domo. So I might need a little bit of guidance on what data sets we need to bring in. But if you guys can support me there, I can support you guys in showing you how to build up the ETL. And then we can start making some cards off of this. Does that sound good?
John D: Yep. That works.
Jenna H: I believe so I took my best guess looking at the tables that you have pulled in right now. And what I think the ones we need, are the one, the job table that I saw that's the name of that one. And then the second one would be work order. Are those the two correct ones?
Appu C: Yeah, job and the work order header?
Jenna H: Yeah. I didn't see a work order header. I just saw it named work order.
John D: Michael might have named it work order apu. He didn't name it exactly as a I.
Appu C: Believe, I gave a breakdown of this report, you know, breaking down the table name, field name, reference connection in our last year you did?
Jenna H: It's it's just whatever even with that information. Michael, when he made the connection, he could have named it something slightly different. So there was a couple different connections that had work order in the title. And I think the one that's just work order is the one that we were looking for. But there's also work order results, work order, scrap, work order cons. And then work order. So, I figured work order is probably the one we want.
John D: Yeah, work order is probably the work order header. Okay? So, but those are nav, are we working with nav? Or are we working with? Yeah, we probably want that one, okay?
Alex D: Perfect.
John D: Cause those are our actual BC, live data.
Alex D: And I'm assuming we're going to want to work with this job table, is this the?
John D: Yeah, are you able to open it up and see what the data is? Yeah, yep, yep, that would be it.

Vince W: Really big now because I went like, I'm at this country club near me and all the ladies during the day, they're like playing mahjong and I'm like this is different, but it seems like a thing.
Sarah C: It's a big thing. I mean, we play every Friday night. We start at four 30 or five o'clock I mean, we finished at nine because we had nothing else to do. But, yeah, we played mahjong. It's amazing how much money they spend on those things. So, I bought because I'm more new to it. I've only been playing for like six months. So, I bought someone's used tiles. Yeah, the tiles they buy them from this one place that's here in Dallas that's called my mahjong, the tiles alone are 450 dollars. Then the map's like another 100. And then the bag's like another 150. And then the container. I mean, it is unbelievable like the like these sets are a 1,000 dollars that these women are playing with and they have multiple sets. Yeah. Wow.

Sarah C: I.
Vince W: gotta get into it.

Sarah C: awesome. But yeah, that's all that's very good.

Simon N: Yeah, that's the thing. Yeah, that's my type of trip right there.
Sarah C: Yeah. So they all cook, they procure their own food. We don't even, we just say, see you, we don't even pay it like, I don't ask what you need. I just let it go. Well.
Simon N: That sounds like a lot of fun. Yeah. Makes me look forward to next weekend already coming off of what sounds like a good weekend for everyone. Good. Yeah, perfect. Well, I know today, we want to talk about procuring the next set of hours to continue the work on the calculators, and then kind of whatever else is top of mind. I know there was some other things on this kind of first scope that we didn't really get to with this last bucket of hours that's when I kind of reset the conversation, see what's top of mind for you as you go forward for Domo. And then I think Vince and Andrew can probably drop off after that, and we can kind of talk budget for Domo 20 26 as it sounds like October is the timeline where you need to have kind of an idea of what the Domo light items don't look like upon renewal next year.
Sarah C: Exactly. So everything's been going well. We've been rolling out by country. I'm already hearing some of them using it even prior to the training which is September twelfth and with really positive, incredibly positive results. And so I feel like we're like doing all the right things. So, yeah. So I want to carry the hours through. I want to get an estimate for a number of hours through the end of the year because I don't want to continue to revise a po because I have to have someone else do that for me because I'm a degenerate in the system. So… I'm not sure how many hours more hours we need to do it because I mean, I think we have probably another… I would say at least six to eight countries left. And then once we kind of get rolled out, I know we're going to have changes because once people get going then, you know, they might have updated benchmarks or we might want to, you know, add another data point to the calculations. Another input point which I think it's being just, it's been discussed. I just said let's go with this first and then let's go from there. So I'm not sure how many hours we're going to need for that. And even if we overestimate, and then just bill along the way, that's fine too. So like let's say we think it's going to take 40 hours. We put in for the po, 60 hours, I'll bill for 30. And then we look at where we are. Then we can bill against it again. And I'm okay with that. So more of a blanket po situation… however that works with your system. That would be easier for me at least from now to the end of the year. And then we can talk about 20 26. I.
Andrew F: Have a quick question on that. Sure. So first of all, you said that there's a number of different countries to look, come on so with that, what's the timeline for bringing them on like ideally.
Sarah C: As.
Andrew F: soon as possible?
Sarah C: No, because I'm waiting on them. So I'm waiting on their benchmark data probably like they already have UK. They're working on utk currently, which I think will probably be done this week. It wasn't that complicated. And then we'll have Germany before the twelfth as well. We do not expect Belgium, nordics, France, Poland until… after mid September, okay?

And again, I think this is where the tweaking comes in because this is last week's, number is including Friday and we don't have all that we probably only have I'm guessing probably a couple of sessions late last night. So these numbers are going to be off by a day, easy tweak to make that's kind of the idea, right? So you can kind of see where you are this week. You can also change this. If you want to look at last week, you can change this here. And now you're looking at all of last week versus the week before that because you're at period over period or I didn't look to see, but you can also look at year over year, how you're doing. So all these numbers will change based on that… below that we get into breaking that down. Again, we can adjust this. We can change it. We can move things around. This is just kind of the order I had it in it's now taking those looking at the same numbers. So last week, so if you see up here, we're up by 27 percent actually let's do it like this. So if we're looking at last week versus the week before we're down 20 percent. First question is why. So if you scroll down, this starts to tell you can start getting into the why and you can see which channels are down week over week, right? So that's what this is. So the blue line is your current, which is last week and you're comparing it to the week before. So a lot of it is this direct traffic, right? Your engage rate is up like, okay, you can kind of see how that's doing across the channels. And then also your new users where are your new users coming in? And if you hover over, this looks like a big number because it's saying that 86 percent compared to 20 percent last week is from email. But that number in parentheses is saying, well, this is only six people. So it's kind of showing you the impact. I'm going to stop for a second. Like is this helping? Is this, am I close to the mark hitting the mark?
Virginia C: I think it's helpful. Is there a way… to look at it? Like if I wanted to dive in specifically to one page on the website or like a collection of pages, is there a way to add that filter in?
Brian F: So we can add that in. So let me keep going because I do have some content towards the bottom, okay? But that's knowing that like that. I think… this is your high level dashboard. And then what you're talking about is like really dive into the content at a page level. And I want to see all this by that page. So that may be, I talk a lot about talking about jobs to be done, the jobs here. The job here is how am I doing overall? The other job that you're talking about is I want to look at a specific piece of content or a specific page and I want to drill in deep so those two dashboards might look slightly different because you're trying to do different things, right? So we'll get to that. So let me keep going again, colors, push them to the side. This is into you're looking at the trend. Now, this is looking by week, but you can also look by day month, quarter year. So this is how you're doing by month. The trend over here on the right is if, you know, my default is I want to know where my so of my traffic coming in. I want to look at my mix and I want to see if it's changing. And what you can see pretty clearly from this is your organic social back at the, in the last half of last year was contributing a lot. And then since the first of the year, it's trailed off, right? So that's the point of that one, it's a little bit different than, you know, some people have seen before, but that's what the idea is. So you can kind of see how your mix is changing. The other thing too right now is I did not group any of these. So you've got, was it one, two three four 510. You have 10 channels that are showing up here, right? So it's getting a little crowded. You know, one thing that we can do is kind of try to group these. I didn't want to do it out of the gate just so we can kind of clean it up a little bit. So it's a little bit easier to read and especially see it when you get down to looking like these, it's all spaghetti. It's kind of hard to see what's going on… but we can group them together. So you can see here, this email for the month of August is way up. So that's looking at 90. This is 93 minutes. That's a lot. On average. It looks like though that your people are spending a lot of time on your website. Does that sound? Yeah? Right. Okay.
Virginia C: We find that we have low total traffic but extended session times because once they get there, we've got good stuff.
Brian F: Okay. Yeah. I guess I could probably add the number of sessions in here that would ",Consumption Pricing Model,54500.0,NO ASSIGNED AE,NORTHHIGHLAND.COM,2,High Tech,2300,$250M to <$500M,Upsell,Blank,Closed Lost,Stuart Roach,2025-09-30,2025-08-20,2025-09-05,,,,,2025-10-06,0013800001F7nCgAAJ

Brian F: Hello? Good afternoon.
Charles H: How's it going?
Ankit S: Good, good. We're going to have a full house here today, looking forward to it. And I believe we're just waiting for Jenna to join as well as a few others. So I'll give it a few minutes.
Charles H: The four of us, Valeria, Chelsea, Isabelle and myself are the only four from thfa today.
Ankit S: Awesome. Hey, Jenna.
Jenna H: Hello? Good morning.
Ankit S: Good morning… Jenna. Are we waiting for Sharon or are we good to get started?
Jenna H: I think we are good to get started.
Ankit S: Okay. All righty. Well, I don't know if it's good to just start with intros and then pass it back to Jenna or Jeremy to kind of kick things off. But it would be good to just get intros if that's a good place to start with the Connecticut housing team first, if that's okay. And then we'll go around to the Domo team and we'll kick it off.
Charles H: Sure. I can start Andrew bolger, senior research and data analyst with chfa.
Isabel D: Hi, Isabel Diaz. I'm the marketing manager here at chfa.
Valeria A: Hi, I'm Valeria alfano, the marketing specialist here at chfa.
Charles H: Hi, my name is Chelsea and I'm a program and data specialist at chfa.
Ankit S: Awesome. I guess I'll go first. I'll send it around to the Domo team. My name is Ankit, somani, I'm going to be the project manager for this engagement. I've been with Domo for three years and have worked with the team here a handful. So just looking forward to getting started.
Charles H: I'm Jeremy stringham, I'm the cae, on this account.
Jenna H: Hey, everybody, you know, me, Jenna, you're a business consultant for the adoption engine program. And Scott is also there, Scott. How are you doing this morning?
Scott T: Sorry, I'm searching for my mute button. I'm good. I've been out sick for some of these days. They don't know but I am on the call. I'll be Tc helping get all of your data connected for this project and I'll be working with Charles and Brian more specifically with the marketing data product.
Charles H: And I'm Alex, dengate, I'm also a Tc Domo side. I'll be helping Scott help Charles and Brian. I'll go next Charles, principal consultant with Domo. I've been with Domo consulting for five years. I have pretty good background in digital marketing technologies as well as all of our sort of ad platforms that you guys are leveraging. So I mean, I'll probably be working and advising Scott and Alex, but yeah.
Brian F: I'll come off camera but I will say I'm recovering so I'm going to no judging and I'll go right back off camera so you can see my face. I'm Brian, I'm a principal consultant, business consultant here at Domo. I've been here for about six years and prior to that, I was on the client side for three years. So my role here is going to be, I mean working with Charles, I'm more on the front end where Charles is more on the back end. So getting the visuals up and running for you guys and telling the data story… right? Okay. Bye. Yeah.
Jenna H: All right. So this is the first stepping point in getting our marketing data products set up for you. So Charles and Brian actually were very hands on in the building of this tool and this product. So that's why we have them here. They are our experts. And then Alex, Scott and I are here to support as well as learn. So I will hand it on over to I'm guessing we, Charles, this is a good place for you to start just talking about the connections. I know Scott resurfaced a knowledge base article that he had sent with the different connectors for the different platforms that you use. So that's step one in the process is getting our data connected to bring it in.
Charles H: Yeah, I mean we can, I guess since we're the front ends already designed and built, it's really just kind of getting those connections and confirming those data sources. So I think the ones that I kind of we were briefed on is that it's Google analytics for… your web, Facebook and LinkedIn, for social… and then for paid search, it's Google ads. And then display, is that campaign manager or Google ads?
Valeria A: I'm not sure about the Google ads.
Jenna H: I think when we had talked that we were saying that if there was something for that portion of, it would have been the Google ads.
Valeria A: So we have Google analytics, we have the social platforms and then what was the?
Charles H: We have Google listed as for paid search and display as well. So neither of those two.
Valeria A: Not that I'm aware of.
Charles H: Okay. All right. That will simplify things. So just Google analytics, Facebook and LinkedIn.
Valeria A: Now, we've talked about in the past also in our past meetings kind of elevating and going and increasing that list. I know we talked about Facebook. We talked about LinkedIn. We've talked about obviously Twitter, we've talked about Instagram. We have a lot of more platforms. So how is that kind of going to expand or are we just going to kind of kick off those initially?
Charles H: For Facebook and this is for advertisements that you're running, correct?
Valeria A: And are you talking about paid advertisements or organic? Okay. So for paid right now, yeah, we have Facebook and we have LinkedIn for paid and Instagram technically because it's all under meta.
Charles H: Yeah, it all runs under meta. Okay. So those are the two kind of data sources that we tap into. I think, okay.
Valeria A: Understood. The.
Charles H: Scope of the product only covers paid advertising.
Valeria A: Understood. Okay.
Charles H: Okay. All right. Okay.
Valeria A: Interesting. Okay.
Charles H: We have Google that's not to say that you can't build like if you wanted to add social on afterwards, it's just more of the scope of what we've kind of built into it is just paid platforms.
Valeria A: Okay.
Brian F: And Charles, correct me if I'm wrong. The reason is because when you get to organic, people… are doing different things like there's a lot of ways you can go. And so this package was supposed to be, you know, meant to kind of be a package, you know, a package, right? And not as much customization.

The team suggested exploring direct access to the raw data source, potentially through IT and the Enterprise Data Warehouse, to allow for more dynamic reporting within Domo. They also discussed empowering multiple merchants with access to the source data to improve data accessibility and usability across the organization.","Todd B: with the table trying to move everything from the pivot table, we do have into another system, it doesn't seem maybe I can do it eventually but I think it's going to be just a ton of work to try to pull everything and then make a bunch of different tables, upload all the pivot tables, combine all the pivot tables, right? Like I think that's the bigger issue. So I wanted to get your guys' thoughts on. And at the same time, I know you can have people help you and build things out. But again, I do think one of the things that's useful about this is if you can make it more self service instead of trying to figure out how to bridge that gap.
Phil S: Yeah, 100 percent agree. And that's what we're here for. And also it's to teach, you know, how we did it too, right? And I think, yeah, going direct to bigquery is probably easier. But like pivot tables and excel, I mean, that's again something where we have a lot of different ways of getting the data in when Jason had first started. He probably shared. I mean it wasn't even like a direct bigquery. It was like all of these other move it over here to then get it in there. So there's a lot of things we can do. And then when you're building data pipelines, I think what's important about self service analytics is that… once the pipeline is done, it's not like you're literally doing that all the time. Like once you get your tables established, self service analytics to me is about like once the pipelines are built in, can I go make some adjustments to it myself? That's going to be way easier than redoing it all from the beginning, right? The foundation's kind of. So I wouldn't beat yourself up if you're like having a little bit of issues of like just getting going in a brand new system, right? But yeah, we can definitely help you there.
Todd B: Okay. Yeah. I think that's going to be the biggest issue because as I was pulling this in the way that, you know, the pivot table works rather than just giving me because I mean, I'm used to being able to pull more of like the raw data in here. It gives me, you know, I have a bunch of like things where, you know, it's got like it's nested inside of this and nested inside of this and you're like you can't I can't just get the rows and the columns built out the way that I want to because I can't just pull in the data the way that I want to. It has to be in this pivot table format. And I just, I don't know how to get, I'm trying, I've been trying this thing and like trying to get it to work and just don't know, you know, don't know how to make it happen.
Benjamin P: And where are you pulling that data from?
Todd B: So, it's from mydrill and so it's basically, this is the first time I've seen this in any organization I've been in where all of the data comes into like just a pivot table like you're not allowed to actually pick and choose the data that you want to bring in. It's just all there and it's all in a pivot table. And so, it's all of the company's data. So like if I'm trying to pull in, it just takes, I mean, if I try to pull in even just sales by quarter and I want to put the quarter in the columns to see like what the quarters are. It just, it takes, it's just taking like a really, long time to get anything done.
Benjamin P: And that's in that system that you're talking about?
Todd B: It's in excel, it's just an excel spreadsheet that gets updated every day and it's just a giant pivot table with all of the company's data on it.
Benjamin P: I got you. Okay. And so… are you just… updating that with the report or with the data that you want? And then you're attempting to upload that data to demo manually?
Todd B: Well, I mean, I'm just trying to even get the data in the pivot table is the problem. So, like for this thing, I was trying to get okay, like let's get a list of the SKUs and then let's get the sales by quarter by region over the last six quarters, right? By SKU. And even that like it kind of broke the system when I tried to get it by quarter by SKU, by region. It just, you know, tells me I get some error message about, you know, I can't.
Benjamin P: so our blocker here is the mechanism that we're using to get the data. So we've not even gotten to the point where the data is ready to put in the demo. It's just getting the data first is where you're being blocked. Is that correct?
Todd B: Yeah. I mean, that's the thing at this point. I just can't I can't get, I can get at a higher level, it's easier to get like a class level. It's easier to get sales by quarter pulled in. And the problem is when you get down to SKU level and you have a lot of SKUs when you add that in, and then you're adding in quarters, and then you're adding in regions like the system gets bogged down, I've realized like pretty quickly when you want to bring in a lot of specific data,
Benjamin P: and they don't give, they do not, do they not give you the ability to access the raw data? Like you said, it's stored in a system called what now?
Todd B: Well, I'm guessing it's just build off it's from these coming in from these tables that we have like the data tables in the background, but we don't every other retailer I've worked for, you have an ability to actually make your own ad hoc reports where you can pull in the data that you want in here. There's no system to pull in the data you want. You can just, the only thing you can use to get the data is this pivot table.
Phil S: Can you show that to me? Oh, sorry. Yeah.
Todd B: Yeah. So let me show you in this one, I think I shared and do they have a support team, the mydrill app group? Do you know who supports it? Yeah. So that's the next thing I haven't had a chance yet to go over to the mydrill support folks and see what they're talking to me about. So here's the mydrill. And so, you get this in and, you know, it's got sales and it's got quarter, but I tried to pull in region, and it broke basically at that point.
Benjamin P: And that raw data, is it stored in those other tabs?
Todd B: The raw data? Oh, no, this is just a bunch of other pivot tables.

After some negotiation, they agreed to auto-renew the contract with the 6% increase, but Bellamy was assured that the increase may be removed in a future multi-year deal, and Justin offered to remove the auto-renewal clause if that would be more suitable.","Jeff R: what's up, Justin?
Justin L: Hey, Jeff. How's it going?
Jeff R: Going, how's it going for you?
Justin L: All right. Friday. It's good.
Jeff R: Yeah, yeah, it's here.
Justin L: Yeah. Just an update. Bellamy just requested a meeting to talk about the renewal. I just sent him basically the auto renewal… with the six percent uplift on it. So I thought he was fine with it. I'm not sure what questions… he has. We'll figure it out maybe.
Jeff R: He has some stuff he wants to go over, but he sounded like last time he spoke that he was feeling… pretty positive about things. I feel like.
Justin L: Yeah, like the adoption engine team has been crushing it with him. He loves them and doing a lot of good stuff. You know, their credit usage declined a ton early this year, but then it picked back up and especially in the last couple months since the adoption engine team. So like, I know he's underutilized from last year, but he's on track to utilize, you know, the 40,000 credits.
Jeff R: Yeah, I do. Maybe that's what it is. Maybe he wants to see how they can get less, but like you said, that usage has climbed.
Justin L: Yeah. And I talked about it a couple of times with him when we kind of talked about renewal. We didn't like, so.
Jeff R: Yeah.
Justin L: Hey, Bellamy.
Bellamy Y: Hey, guys. Hey.
Justin L: How are you?
Jeff R: We're good. How are you doing?
Bellamy Y: Good, good. Wrapping things up because it's freaking Friday. Happy Friday. Yes. Happy Friday to you guys too. Hey, guys. I wanted to, yeah.
Justin L: Oh, no worries. Go ahead.
Bellamy Y: I wanted to talk about the renewal that's coming up. So as we discussed, we're most likely going to do just another year renewal as per this contract. I believe it's six percent increase automatically right now. So that's okay for the next year, we can do a six percent increase. Igor asked me to see if we can dwindle it down the automatic renewal percentage to zero percent instead of six, six is a little bit too high. Now, just between you and I, we know that we're most likely going to have a good chance of ripping up this contract and then renegotiating for a longer term deal afterwards. So this particular renewal percentage might not even come into play. But just in case it does come into play, we wanted to make sure we can dot the I's and see if we can lower down that renewal percentage.
Justin L: Yeah, I can ask. I mean… that's not like the biggest deal in the world but that's like one of the big things our finance department is sticky on like when just to be transparent, they love the longer term deals. So I can kind of tell them, hey, we have a side agreement with Bellamy, not agreement. Just kind of a pretty good idea that hopefully here in the next few months, we'll rip this up and do a, you know, do a three year or four or five year whatever it is, correct? Yeah, once we have a better idea of kind of what your projected credit usage is, they'll be like, well, yeah. So anyway, I can ask, yeah, and see if we can just you're just saying for the end for the, if we went another year and the renewal came up again, you don't want it on the next one?
Bellamy Y: Yeah, correct. Yeah. We can, we don't want another automatic renewal on the next one. If we can have zero percent renewal increase after this one year, knowing that most likely we're not going to even reach that point.
Justin L: Yeah. I'll ask. They may come back with, well… hey, just tell him that you'll work it out then with him even though it's on the paperwork because once in a while, I'll get it off of a renewal like.
Bellamy Y: Yeah.
Justin L: So I'll ask, is it?
Jeff R: Is it even on the contract per SE? I know it's standard for us to do six percent. I'm just curious if there's any language in there because, you know, I have in full transparency gotten been able to. Maybe I haven't got it waived, but I've been able to work it down in the past depending on a certain position. So, I'm just curious if there is any language on there because I don't know if they would even put language on that contract. Does that make sense? I don't think I've seen it on the list.
Justin L: I think it's in our terms and conditions.
Jeff R: Like the online ones.
Justin L: Yeah… you might be right. I'm pretty sure it's in there. I'm not a lawyer. I don't read through that. No, you're right? You're right? Though, Bellamy, I'm pretty sure it's in there. Okay? In your contract, there's a link to our service terms, right? And I think in those service terms, it states that on an auto renewal… I'll have to check and see, I'll look at it and I'll ask.
Bellamy Y: Okay. Look, I mean, whatever it is. Obviously if we don't get that six percent increase on this particular renewal, amazing awesome. We're most likely going to negotiate for something much better anyways though. So, I'm not too worried if it's like six percent automatic, but it will be very good to have for sure for Igor's perspective for this next year renewal, if we can bake it in so that we can say zero percent renewal on the next year, that would silence his concern, which then we have kind of like I already told him about like, hey, we're most likely going to need to do like a longer term contract renegotiation anyways, because our use case is growing quite fast with your team helping us out. So he understands, and he thinks that that's a good plan as well. It's just for his own sake. He wants to have it zero.
Justin L: Gotcha.
Bellamy Y: Let me know what you guys can do if you can. I mean it is what it is. We asked at least, you know.
Justin L: Yeah, they'll stick with it for the renewal right now just because it's a, really standard one year. And just so you know, Bellamy on my side, like I just had a long meeting this morning and this is what we were discussing. We're almost trying really hard… to be really consistent across all of our customers like, hey, if we're charging a six percent on renewals, we're charging it, not willy nilly.

Michael D: Jason Phil.
Jason J: Hey.
Phil S: Hey, hey. We were just on with Jason and Ben Parker was helping out with a potential AI use case, AI agent use case.
Jason J: I think I put Michael on that too. If you saw that maybe I didn't no. Okay. Sorry. Well with the.
Phil S: Idea. Yeah.
Jason J: With just the idea saying, hey, I want to like, hey, I got an idea for AI, let's talk about it type thing.
Michael D: Yeah, I saw the email but you guys already met on it.
Jason J: Yeah, that's what I thought I put you on.
Michael D: I thought you were talking about a meeting?
Jason J: No, no, no, just it just so you got an idea at the base, what we were talking about. Yeah, we kind of talked through that and how to get to a data point of what we could run through an AI agent to start figuring this out. So, again, it all relies on me being able to get connected to our gemini. So segue… over to you Zach. Yeah, anything new?
Zachary O: Honestly, I'm I think Ken needs to enable something to get you your model, but that is straight, that information was straight from Ken Boyer. Yeah. So.
Jason J: I mean, it makes sense like I have like, I have a button that says ad model. Yeah. Okay. I can go in there. There's. Just nothing there.
Zachary O: Right. So that's where we got to diagnose what, why we can't see the specifics. And, so we'll I'll I'm checking through the features, haven't seen anything specific, but it could be something that's not, publicly visible to me. So that's where I go.
Jason J: I'm still saying it's azure, it's going to be azure watch. I'm telling you.
Phil S: Maybe.
Zachary O: I don't know. I'm going to double check,
Jason J: But we have a solution for that too, though. So, it's not like that's that doesn't scare me because then, like Phil and I will just work and we'll get me moved over to GCP which should be a nice, like I'm sure people at home depot will love to hear that one. Oh, and I don't know, I was going to send this to you yesterday. I was goofing around hitting buttons in Google that's how I kind of found that other way that I was talking about optimizing, like I may be able to opt, take that scan stable and partition it like build my own. I mean, I'm going to be storing 500,000,000 records twice in, friggin' Google, but that's what it's there for, but actually partition it. So it's actually, you can use it. And then when we start running stuff that way, I can tap the partitions in Domo and really speed that shit up. But with that… man, that was leading to a better point. And then I lost it… I really hate getting old, but, I,
Zachary O: feel it. I feel it, Jason, I,
Jason J: know, dude, it's like, man, I had this whole great thing laid out and then like get about halfway through and then I'm like, damn it, I still don't believe the ravens are celebrating the thirtieth anniversary of the browns or becoming like stealing the team from the browns while the browns are friggin' there. You know, real world problems.
Phil S: All roads in Jason's mind lead back to the browns, right? It's like, thank… you for not.
Michael D: Wearing my bengals hat to this meeting it.
Jason J: Doesn't bother me, man. No, that does not bother me in the least. Man. Bring it on. Yeah. Now, so we were, so I'm working to speed that up. I mean, I'll get to stuff for Ben in the next couple days to do that one. Oh, the plan to go to GCP. Oh, that was it. Damn it. I was clicking around in gbq, and if you Qlik on the partner tab there, it's not the top column, but Domo is in the next one. It doesn't say you can get it in marketplace, but I mean, it's there. So, hey, I mean.
Zachary O: Jason.
Jason J: Offish, yeah, from the top is what I'm saying either. So, is.
Zachary O: this what you've seen?
Jason J: Gotta pull this over here and make it bigger.
Michael D: The add model button, no.
Jason J: I don't have that at all. I, the whole place and the pics you sent me at first were at the text to sequel area, right?
Zachary O: I went to Domo, AI.
Jason J: Okay. Let me check model… gemini or Domo AI?
Zachary O: And then you can create an account.
Jason J: Ad model. Yeah, look there's, vertex there's, hugging face. Who is he using? Gemini? Well, where the hell? Well… which one do I use? I?
Zachary O: Think it's gemini vertex? Okay?
Jason J: I was gonna.
Michael D: Say they're.
Jason J: both that way, once, just in parentheses. Yeah. Okay. I'll try the first one.
Zachary O: And then you just create an account and it'll walk you through, yeah.
Jason J: I'm trying it now. Awesome. Fuck, it's a service account. Yeah.
Zachary O: Because, I was looking in here originally in AI, service layer.
Jason J: Okay. And,
Zachary O: so, but then I went, let's poke around because that's one place where I don't poke around is clients don't yeah.
Jason J: They never told me to delete the private key off of my computer. I mean, she deleted it off though. I mean, hey… if.
Zachary O: it helps you, do you?
Jason J: Remember, is it the whole thing or is it just the private key area? Part? Oh.
Zachary O: That is a very good question.
Jason J: Okay. I'll just try both. It don't matter. Location, what's location mean? I don't know what the,
Michael D: is it similar to like where you're where it's being hosted at?
Zachary O: Yeah, that's how I would guess.
Jason J: Yeah, but you would think it's a drop down in that case, but it's not.
Michael D: Oh, it's just an open text field.
Jason J: Yeah. So, maybe it's just, I bet you, maybe it's like a naming field… type thing.
Zachary O: It's probably because there's actual locations. So, like U. S central that's.
Michael D: what I was thinking? Yeah.
Jason J: Yeah, yeah, I'll put U. S east and see if it does anything.
Zachary O: U. S, east five is Columbus, Ohio.
Jason J: That works for me, but,
Zachary O: it all depends on is.
Jason J: There a dash in it.
Zachary O: Here, I'll fire you, the vertex, this is what I've got here is… the locations for vertex.
Jason J: Yeah.
Zachary O: So, that should give you at least you can pick whichever one you're set up in and it'll probably work best on that.

Nik K: Hello? Sorry, I'm running late here.
Juliana J: No worries. Great. I'm just going to shoot Brian a message and see if he's able to make it and then we can get started. Okay. So, Joe, we saw the links to the data sets that you sent over this morning. Thanks for sending that. So, I think you had mentioned the only piece that you're foreseeing needing our assistance with is getting like the notes added in. Is that correct?
Joseph L: Correct. Yeah. Some way for the finance team to like retain the notes that are, you know, each data kind of enter notes of what's being paid and all that. And then, you know, a way for that to be retained for historically and then new notes to be added into that table as they come up.
Juliana J: Great. Okay, awesome. So, I think that Nick wanted to take a look and see kind of what the visuals look like now so that we can figure out the best way to set that up. So, Nick, I'll let you.
Nik K: Yeah, I think… there's a couple of ways we can tackle just taking user input data and then storing it. What we wanted to understand was just what kind of interface you were thinking of? If you had some design around the dashboard, what it would look like for them to consume the ag report or sorry, Ar, report. Is it going to be a table card? Or did you have some charts in mind? Just wanted to see if there's something we start with or we can propose an option just independently of that.
Joseph L: Yeah. So for now, I basically recreated the table that I think you guys went through in the meeting with the finance team that where they have that Ar agent report that they have a, you know, every day they're creating a new tab and going through. So I kind of recreated that in that format. But I, in my mind getting them some visualizations would be, would work as well. You know, they're still kind of on the, they like getting the tables and pulling it out and seeing the data in the way that they're used to. But I think visualizations could be kind of helpful going forward and getting them on that path.
Dave: Yeah, I think I'd agree. Joe. It's like the finance team is probably going to continue to live in their basic table cards, but I'm thinking for the other folks that are taking a look at this Mary Alice's and wholesale's of the world, like they're going to want to look at maybe some visualizations work out there to where maybe we have like a sub dashboard a and B1 that's kind of condensed and some nice visualizations for someone just checking in on it. And then the finance full version.
Nik K: Yeah. Okay. And then is there value in that one to be more customer by customer or everyone together? How do they kind of consume it?
Dave: I think from what we saw, there's definitely a good bit of like by customer analysis happening as well as that mso code was another big one in how they're looking at it because that kind of bridges together, you know, a company that we deal with in five of our states.
Nik K: Yes. Okay. That helps. So in that case… I think what we'll do then is we'll try to use. So there's two routes we can take. One is just using native out of the box capability. So in this case, I think Domo forms would probably be the best option. So you have a dropdown. Have, you guys have seen Domo forms before?
Joseph L: Seen them but we haven't really used them much yet. Yeah.
Nik K: Okay. And so what I'm imagining is just, you know, you have your dashboard with visuals and stuff and you've kind of filtered to one mso or one customer or it could be multiple. But in the form, what you would do is the form just sits as a card on your dashboard, maybe off to the side somewhere or even as a tab, right? And you Qlik through and you say, okay, I want to update nodes and you pick from a first drop down what the customer mso is. And then below that, you have a text box where you can see maybe the previous comments that there were, and then another text box where you can now type in the new comments and then just a save button, right? And that saves it. And it shows up back into the table card or wherever else it was originally visualized. And so in that case, the input is right there on the dashboard and it's just tucked away inside like a tab and you just Qlik and flip to it when you need to add input. And otherwise, you can just visually see what was already stored for that customer.
Dave: Sounds perfect to me and like what they needed based on what they walked us through.
Nik K: Yeah. Okay. The more seamless approach would be a full custom app, in which case, the app would show you kind of the tabular version of it. And then on the side, you know, just within the table, you're kind of just typing as almost as if it's a spreadsheet, right? And you have a cell that's editable that might be more familiar to them. It's obviously, there's custom development and then maintenance of the code. So I would lean towards domoforms if you want to try that. That will be a rapid kind of prototype for us to build up as well and show you.
Dave: Yeah. I think I'd go with forms. I mean, I think you're right on, it might seem a little more natural the other way for them, but I'd like to try forms and see if we can't get on there without that. And if nothing else, it's going to give us a look at forms which we've already got quite a few other data sets where we think that could be pretty useful.
Nik K: Okay. Sounds good. Okay. So in that case, here, let me just pull.
Joseph L: this.
Nik K: Shared this morning, right? So.

Brian W: Oh, awesome. Great.
Aishwarya D: Yes, thank you so much. I booked my flight tickets this weekend and I am set to arrive in Florida on the 20 fifth of October.
Brian W: Wow. Almost close to me. Can I ask maybe what city in Florida?
Aishwarya D: Palm city?
Brian W: Jacksonville?
Aishwarya D: Where are you?
Brian W: I'm in Orlando. So central Florida.
Aishwarya D: Oh, actually, I'll be coming into Orlando.
Brian W: Alright, cool. Well, that's awesome news.
Aishwarya D: Yes. And for that, I have planned to take leaves from the fifteenth starting the fifteenth of October on to the 30 first. So, the latter half of this month and that's where Ruchita comes in. She has been up to date with all the tasks we have had for Astra so far. She's aware of the data. In fact, she was the one who worked on the bridges, so she knows as to what needs to be done and I'm sure it'll be just as how it was in my absence as well. So, Ruchita, do you want to go ahead and introduce yourself quickly? Yes. So.
Ruchita D: Hello? I'm Ruchita, and I have been working with Aishwarya and Ankit on two other projects now, and it's been really interesting and I have been working with Astra as well from a few days and it's been great and I was really excited to meet Brian and everyone, I know we don't have other people on the call but yeah, I would really like to meet them all.
Brian W: Yeah. Well, welcome and looking forward to working with you. Sorry, am I saying this, right?
Aishwarya D: Ruchita. Yeah, Ruchita.
Brian W: Oh, Ruchita. Okay. Well, nice to meet you and welcome, yep.
Ruchita D: Nice to meet you too.
Ankit S: And sorry, I was late guys, but yeah, thanks, Aishwarya for informing Brian and we do have eight hours left. So I'm sure we're going to finish that in the next couple weeks and Brian, I don't want to make any assumptions but I would think we're in a pretty good spot with this engagement. I don't know if there's been any talks about getting more hours… if there are then great. But I would just… I guess we probably just need a little bit of time at the start of October to jump back in with Kyle and Christine because I know they've been a little bit, not so involved with this as Aishwarya and Ruchita have been taking the lead but Kyle and Christine are ready to go if we do purchase more hours and I'll be sure to reach out to Vu and Eric about that as well.
Brian W: Yeah, I'll give them a heads up, but yeah, I do think we're in a good spot here with the data and just how generally how things look. I think maybe our next steps here is kind of just other UI changes and improvements just to make it easier for folks. But I think from a data standpoint, we're as far as we can get and we know about some of the other issues like it's internal problems with our balance sheet, and how sagebooks are all working and all that stuff.
Ankit S: Yeah. Awesome. Well, yeah. I mean, we of course, have Christine who's a business consultant and specializes in finance and front end. So, yeah, she'd be able to jump right in. So, yeah, we'll be sure to just talk more about that end of month, early November. Great.
Aishwarya D: Awesome. Yeah. I saw the mail come through from Eric regarding, yeah. So there's not much there if we want to move to sage in tech, If you think the data looks okay, we can just import that dashboard into app studio instead of replacing the existing one. Okay? We can delete that if you don't want it, but I think it'll be better to just create a new app and apply the same formatting as we have for excel right now.
Brian W: Yeah, I like that approach for better or worse. People rely on the excel packs and we want to try to get away from that.
Aishwarya D: All right.
Brian W: So, I'm good with that, having basically another app studio for the intact version.
Aishwarya D: Okay. That's perfect. I can do that. So.
Brian W: Do you want to go through Eric's notes that he sent out? What was it 30 minutes ago? I?
Aishwarya D: Can't remember? Yes. Well, the first is to have a better title and logo.
Brian W: Yeah, which I'm not too worried about.
Aishwarya D: But yes, yeah. So if you have any image as well, yeah, as an icon for the app, we can use that.
Brian W: Yep. I'll maybe send something over probably just our regular astro icon is good.
Aishwarya D: And any suggestion… with the title?
Brian W: Yeah. Yep. And that as well. I'll give it some thought. Okay. I mean, I like financial performance, but if they want something else, we'll get some feedback.
Aishwarya D: Okay. For now, I'll just change it to financial performance, so it doesn't say finance PPT? Okay?
Brian W: Great. Sorry. Let me pull up Eric's email here. Yeah.
Aishwarya D: Yeah. So.
Brian W: We talked briefly about the UI and title. Oh, one thing for UI and I'll share now.
Aishwarya D: Yeah.
Brian W: Can you all see?
Aishwarya D: Yes.
Brian W: Yes. Is there a way to add like spacers in between the month of date, year to date and like ttm columns, so it's a little easier to look at?
Aishwarya D: That will be then separate cards?
Brian W: Oh, those are separate cards then. Okay. Yeah, we.
Aishwarya D: Can't add spacers within a table?
Brian W: We can't add like a blank column that's just.
Aishwarya D: Yes, but it will look, it will confuse the users because it will still have the header color like all the formatting, the rows?
Brian W: I see. Okay, you?
Aishwarya D: Can't disable the borders for one particular column?
Brian W: Okay. And I guess having what? Three cards now? So six on this page probably over complicates it then just to have a space. I mean, that was really just maybe my nitpicky… item here. I just think it would be easier to look at to have spaces in between the month of the year today. Yeah.

The team agreed on a two-pronged approach to further explore the AI chat functionality, including uploading the raw data as well as adding AI-generated context to the data.","Matthew N: hey, Ben. How you doing?
Benjamin P: Hey, matt. I'm good. How are you?
Matthew N: Doing good, man. Doing good.
Benjamin P: It is Friday afternoon.
Matthew N: Yep.
Benjamin P: Is this your last meeting?
Matthew N: It is. Yeah, I'm actually been last hour or two. I've been trying to create some more, I'm trying to increase my workflow and AI agent knowledge stuff. So, I've been trying to come up with different things that I do routinely and see if I can automate that stuff. That's what I've been doing the last hour or so.
Amrit: Oh, cool.
Matthew N: We're supposed to get a taste of fall this week, man. Are we, yeah, I think it's supposed to… up here. It sounds like it's going to be like in the seventies?
Benjamin P: Oh, wow. Yeah, it looks like the lows next week looks like it's going to get down to the sixties and then the high most days in the low eighties. So, yeah, that will be nice. I'll tell you what this seems like during this whole summer, at least over the last two months anyway, it seems like it's rained like every single afternoon, it rains even if it's just a little bit, like every afternoon, we have light thunderstorms. So, I'm just like going to get past all that. Because you're more north Georgia, right?
Matthew N: Yeah, I'm about 30 Miles west of Atlanta.
Benjamin P: Gotcha. Yeah, yeah.
Amrit: Hey, Emmett. Am I audible or am I on mute?
Benjamin P: Yes, I can hear you, oh.
Amrit: Thanks for being flexible on this one. This week has been more busy than I anticipated. So didn't get a chance to look into the tool until Wednesday. So I thought it would probably make sense for us to connect on Friday rather than like to make sure we make better use of our time.
Benjamin P: Yeah, yeah. No problem at all. We're happy to flip that around for you. So you were able to get in on Wednesday and work with the tool a little bit, so.
Amrit: I did. So, I didn't go too far, so I had one question. So basically, what I was trying to do was basis some of my use cases. I was trying to let me share my screen if I can let me see. How does that work in zoom… because like I said, zoom is something which is a bit… oops. Okay. I don't think it's not a word. Are you able to see my screen?
Benjamin P: Yes.
Amrit: I.
Benjamin P: can see the excel file. Oh, there you go.
Amrit: So, now you see the right one?
Benjamin P: Yep.
Amrit: Okay. Again, I think it's excel. Nice. Like I said, zoom, one second, let me get it again.
Benjamin P: And Amrit going forward, if you would rather us in these in teams if you prefer teams, we can certainly do that.
Amrit: Yeah, that would be better actually. Okay. So you can see the Domo, something familiar to you, right? So when I was trying to upload the data and play with it, what I ended up was like more as a dashboard kind of a thing. But I wanted to know if I have like a let's say a flat file and I want to go ahead and do that. How would I manage… if, how would I go about it if I'm more trying to create like a chat agent experience? So let's say if I have a review data for a category like for home depot products, I want to upload that. And I want to ask questions around, hey, how are we doing? In terms of product feedback, etc, what approach should I be taking over here? Because when I do.
Benjamin P: Just a flat excel file with the data?
Amrit: Yeah. As in just to start with that. So I know I can upload a file from here. So, but how would I do it if I were to kind of, so let's say this is the file?
Benjamin P: Yep.
Amrit: And if I upload it, so that's the same file which was there. So basically, this is review level home depot products. Yep. Right? So that's where you see all the data and this is the now I import this. So it's optional. So I can just Qlik save and run, right?
Benjamin P: Yep.
Amrit: Okay. It, so will import. So, which, this is the same stage I went through earlier as well. So now it says, start utilizing, which is what was happening in this tab as well. Right? Yeah. Now, how do we kind of get to that experience where we can ask questions based on the data rather than like creating visualization, because that is what essentially right now we are looking for is that, yep.
Benjamin P: So what you want to do is just exit out of this exit out of this box and just Qlik that exit there at the top, right?
Amrit: Yes, this one?
Benjamin P: And, yep. And just go ahead and Qlik. OK. And so every time you upload a data set, whether it be through a connector, whether it be through a static upload, the way you've done, whether it be through some sort of a cloud API connection, it immediately, if you Qlik on that little message, the blue message icon that'll go away. So, right next to AI chat, Qlik on the, yeah, there we go.
Amrit: Thank you. And.
Benjamin P: Then at the top, if you get a more in the middle, there, you should see one that says data. So if you go right there in the middle, it says data. And if you go to the left hand side, right below that block, there's a little, go up a couple, one more, one more, yeah, Qlik on that. And so this is where all your data sets are. So every single time you upload or add data to your demo instance, it creates a data set with that data set. You can do several different things. You can use that data set as an input to a data flow. So like an ETL operation, you can use that data set to power a visualization. So that's what you were seeing just a moment ago, the interface for creating a visualization from that data set. Or you can equip that data set with, context that it will need to support AI chatting. And so that would really be our first next step. If you go ahead and Qlik on that data set. The… first thing we'll want to do in order to provide us with the best responses, is to equip this data set with the context that it needs. So if you go to more at the top, right next to the data tab?
Amrit: This one?
Benjamin P: No, go down. Okay. There you go. Yep, and then go to AI readiness. And what you'll see here is you can add columns right there in the middle, and this will allow you to add the columns to this sort of like a data dictionary for AI to follow. And so if you Qlik on the top le",Consumption Pricing Model,338173.18,Enterprise,HOMEDEPOT.COM,3,Retail,475000,>=$1B,New Logo,Sales,3: Demonstrate Value,Phil Stewart,2026-04-17,2025-07-01,2025-07-01,2025-08-08,,,,,0015000000YrkyqAAB

They also explored the possibility of incorporating AI capabilities into the application to enhance the user experience, and Sam outlined their plan for managing development, sandbox, and production environments to improve instance management. The team agreed to schedule a follow-up meeting to discuss the next steps for the AI integration and instance management solution.","Ashish C: Sam, I'm over here.
Sam D: Talking and thinking, you can hear me? Can you hear me? I can hear you. Yeah. Can you hear me? I've.
Ashish C: got some new headsets and they're not, yes, you are, let me.
Sam D: I'm not going to take one more.
Ashish C: How you been anything new?
Sam D: Yeah. We actually just finished a sprint for… our store… spotlight application. That was a big one we've been working on for months and the team kind of just was racing to get it over the finish line today. And so, it's in and we're pretty excited and finally breathing because it was a lot.
Ashish C: What did the sprint contain?
Sam D: The significant number of changes, to the application, at all levels, corporate district store, we introduced, people into, the, the application, turnovers, promotions, we really listened to our end users and, employed a lot of, of their feedback into it. We, we took advantage of, some of the drill through capabilities, that we weren't really taking advantage of prior. So, so some of the, some of that, was enabled, a lot of things. This was a big one. And funny enough, we're starting the next phase. We're gonna let, Sharon, go on vacation, and then, when she gets back, we'll start phase five. We're on or, version five. Yeah. Version five will be, we're gonna inject our customer's sentiment into the app. So we'll know, you know, who's getting good feedback, who's getting bad feedback, who needs help, and who's kicking butt and taking names. And then we're also, we're introducing this concept of, scorecard where we're basically grading the stores and we're saying, hey, based on all of these various metrics that we're, judging you on, I think on sex, got just text, I don't know today, but back in the office tomorrow, please, let me know if there's anything. Okay. Yeah. So we're gonna basically try to take all of that content, that we have for stores and, grade them on it and say, okay, you know, you're you know, and, each KPI will have like points like, okay sales, you're a B store, labor, you're a, an, a store, merchandising, you're a C, you know, abc combined, you're kind of like a B, on average or something like that. So, we want to give them we want them to know that, you know, we're considering everything and it's not just like one thing. So that, that'll be the next phase as well. The one thing that, something to think about too, the one thing that one of, our head of strategy has kind of challenged us with was like, hey, can we ever get to a point where we can enable AI on the application? And so, you know, the user can basically, I'll give you, let me pull it up real quick just to kind of give you a sense of like, what I'm talking about here? And then there's one thing I'm hoping I don't know if you can even help me with, but maybe we can figure out who can help me. So… this is, the app, they want to get to right now. AI is not enabled as you can see, there would be like a little button here, but I don't know enough to be dangerous, like I'm a little nervous to turn AI on because I don't know what AI is going to do once it gets in here. I guess we could test in our, this is dev right now. Actually let me go to prod… might be worth a discussion, you know, like the business question is, hey, how do we, how do we enable AI in a safe way in a meaningful way? In the right way? Most importantly, you know, for our users to utilize, and, you know, make, you know, take action, around, that'll be like the next level that'll be like the mind blowing sort of, you know, moment that, you know, our owners would love to see, and actually use, and feel. But right now, it's very much a, you know, Qlik, and, you know, kind of maneuver around, you know, the app experience. And I think, we can definitely take this to the next level with AI. So, I don't know how much you know, about AI as far as, you know, using it in apps are concerned. Like, do we have to go into every single? Like we have all of these data sets powering this app right now? There's probably, I think 20 of them, like, do we have to basically go into every single data set and then turn on, or, modify the AI readiness aspect of that data set. So, like, if I go to this Guy, you know, AI readiness is off, right now, do we have to, is the order of operations? Like, okay, if you have 20 data sets powering that app, go into each one of those data sets, turn on, you know, the, AI readiness, I don't even know how to be or where to even begin to do that, add columns, probably, and then rinse and repeat for the next data set and rinse and repeat for the next data set. And then once we have all of the AI readiness turned on for each of these data sets, turning on the AI, in the app itself would just kind of be like the cherry on top moment where it's like, okay, it's using the AI readiness behind the scenes within the data sets to help answer the questions that the user has up front in the app itself. Does that, does that sound? Does that sound like what, the process would look like or?
Ashish C: Yeah, the, the only question I have, is if it needs to be done at the individual level or if there's a way, to aggregate that if there's, shared columns and that sort of thing within your sets?
Sam D: Maybe we can, maybe we can coordinate, a discussion with, you know, if you wanted to maybe think about like, okay, Sam's, asking, you know, you know, to enable AI for, you know, what I would call, you know, our most important application, with the most reach, with the most impact right now. How does he, you know, we don't need to get into the weeds, but how do we go about doing that? If we had a pretty good idea, we would, I would absolutely start kind of working on that behind the scenes. And then kind of, you know, surprise the end, the business like, you know, just be like, hey, it's ready to go, you know, yeah.
Ashish C: Is, is AI chat? Do you envision one of your users coming in? They get their health grade score? They go to AI, why is my health grade score? What it is? How can I improve it?

Tom H: So, we're doing like a week and a half. We're going to be in California. We're going to be in San Diego and then we're going to go inland after that. So it'll be a lot of fun.
Simeon N: Total other side of the country that's nice. San Diego is gorgeous. Oh, yeah. Yeah, that'll be fun. You're going to have a good time?
Tom H: Yeah, we were there a couple years ago for a friend's wedding. We had a really great time, so we're excited to get back out.
Simeon N: Yeah, it was funny. I've only been there once and it was enough for my wife to be like, man, this is so nice. Why don't, we just look at living here? Yeah. Right. Yeah, I just laughed. Have you looked at zillow or anything? You'll know why… it was funny, but yeah, no, it's beautiful. I'm sure. It's an awesome time of year to go. Oh, yeah. Are you going to do any golfing or anything down there? They've got Torrey pines and everything.
Tom H: I think we're mostly going to be hiking and then I don't know my wife's friends are there. So we're going to be out with them doing, I think a lot of touristy stuff and, you know, checking out restaurants and stuff that they enjoy. It's. Really interesting because San Diego is kind of like Tampa because it's like waterside and like military presence. Yeah, you know, lots of like beaches and like little neighborhoods and stuff kind of how you have like Tampa's st, Pete, yeah.
Mark H: Just, no humidity.
Tom H: Yeah, just no humidity and it's 70 degrees instead of 90 degrees. Yeah.
Simeon N: I know every time we fly to Florida, it's just the ultimate. It's a battle choosing what to wear on the flight because it's like in Utah, it can be hot but it's never humid. And as soon as you step off that plane in Miami or wherever we land, you feel it. And there was one time last year where I think we went around October to like boca raton and it was just funny because it was freaking freezing in Utah and it was almost like, oh, I think it was snowy weather but in Florida, it was pretty warm out there. So like dressing for the plane, it was just like, I don't know pick your poison. Do I want to be too cold or too warm, but cool? Well, I don't see. I'm not sure if we're going to have Kenneth jump on. I didn't see an email response from him. And so I figured, you know, mark and Thomas, we can have this conversation and it's recorded. So if we want to share it with him or I have a proposal that you can kind of circulate afterwards. And then of course, I know that this is, of course, mark and Kenneth, the decisions are going to be mostly between you guys. So I want to make sure we've got, you know, the questions answered. I want to make sure we're finding a way for Thomas and his team and the developers to be able to do what they need to do in Domo and not feel, you know, they've got some constraints that are unrealistic. So, does that sound fair? Do we want to? I don't know if you've heard from Kenneth or if we just proceed without him?
Mark H: Well, I guess we'll proceed without him, but I like your, you know, he's recorded, he'll have a proposal. So, you know, we'll follow up internally and then he'll follow up with you as needed.
Simeon N: Sweet. Okay. So that sounds great. I think as far as, and it looks like rob just joined. So, rob, thanks for jumping on mark. If you haven't met rob before he's your customer success manager. So from the Domo side, thanks for jumping on rob. Yeah, great to meet you, mark. Looking forward to it. Thanks.
Mark H: Likewise.
Simeon N: All right. So after our last conversation, what I heard and what I've tried to kind of put together and chatted with Thomas a little bit about this and how we best achieve kind of the two requests. So after the call mark, I think the request that we had from you was seeing a one year, what would that look like? Comparing it against the alternatives? So I do have a one year proposal for you that we can kind of walk through. And then also taking into account what Ken had said, where Ken was, you know, it seemed like he was highly concerned with cost per credit and value and being able to communicate that value back to the business. So there is also a way that we can kind of get him what he's asked for or at least, you know, put something on the table and see if it's in line with what he was envisioning. So we'll just go ahead and walk through these. If you don't mind, give me just a moment. I will share my screen. Are you seeing this?
Mark H: Yes.
Simeon N: Cool.
Tom H: All right.
Simeon N: So, I'm and then also Thomas, there's the factor with, you know, taking historical usage and trying to predict future usage. And I think just trying to make sure that you guys are situated in a spot for the next little bit that takes care of you. So I'm just going to jump, to the one year proposal first and we can kind of walk through that and what that looks like. All right. So on the left, I'll just kind of walk through this and make it as easy as possible and try to say as few words as possible. Just I don't want to make it muddy. On the left, we're looking at your current agreement, what's currently used? We're pacing to be roughly 60,000 credits over. So that's what that 60 K is. So that's the quantity of credits that we would want to find a way to account for, right? Whether it's a one two three, five year deal, whatever that's what we're kind of trying to solve for. And then any future beyond that with a one year proposal legacy that's going to be kept, that's going to be grandfathered. Thomas is familiar with that.

They reviewed the formatting and layout of the dashboard, made suggestions for improvements, and agreed on the next steps, such as addressing the balance sheet discrepancies and incorporating additional data validation features in the app studio.","Brian W: hey, Brian. Hey, Aishwarya. I don't think Eric or Vu will join, but I think we're in a homestretch here. Almost. Yeah, yes.
Aishwarya D: Well, I don't have any major update, but.
Brian W: As promised?
Aishwarya D: We did make some progress on the app studio.
Brian W: Oh, nice.
Aishwarya D: So, just walk you through it. If that's okay. I mean, if you want to cover anything else before that, we can do that.
Brian W: No, not specifically. I mean, I've been spot checking for validation here and there with Eric. And now that we got it to our GBPS of finance, I mean, they'll do a more detailed validation. I mean, they know their opcos and groups a lot better than we do, right? But we did do a lot of the heavy lifting up front and let them know of our issues. I mean, I'm still going to take a look at it. I mean, not just the app studio, but even just the dashboard itself, hopefully before the end of the week. But yeah, if you want to share some updates on the app studio, that'd be great.
Aishwarya D: Sure. Yes. Okay. So it was already shared but I'll still check. I'll still confirm. Yeah, it's shared so you can still access, sorry.
Brian W: This is the app studio.
Aishwarya D: Yeah, this is app studio.
Brian W: Oh, okay.
Aishwarya D: Yeah. So I went through the brand kit and this is again, not a complete completely finished yet. I still have to do some last finishing touches, but I looked at the other apps and you have the other, the secondary color which is a bit orange. So I tried that, but I personally felt that it was overpowering.
Brian W: Okay. So.
Aishwarya D: I can, no, we can add it for sure, but I just thought I can show you what we can do apart from that. And then if needed, we can always change it. Okay? So this is how it looks right now. We have subpages that covers the sections. We, oh nice have been identified on the main dashboard. So the first page just has two cards which is consolidated and group financial results. And if you'll see it's more breathable and covers your screen. So you don't have to.
Brian W: Zoom in.
Aishwarya D: And then if you go to the second page, and this is again, the first draft, we can make changes to make sure the title looks a bit more appealing. And here we have introduced tabs. So if you Qlik on P. L, oh nice.
Brian W: Okay.
Aishwarya D: It will show you these four table cards.
Brian W: Oh, yeah. Awesome. All right.
Aishwarya D: Yeah. So it's a lot consolidated and it doesn't have to, you don't have to like scroll a lot.
Brian W: Yeah.
Aishwarya D: So that's why we thought of breaking it down into PL and budget, but again, it may not be the best use on this page. But if you identify anywhere where we can club things together with a separator like this, we can do that. These are called tabs. These are called pages.
Brian W: Okay. Can we go back and start to the other one real quick? The project service mix?
Aishwarya D: Yes.
Brian W: So, we've got PL, maybe that could just be, can we name this actuals?
Aishwarya D: Yeah. Okay. I can do it right now.
Brian W: Nice… budget is fine. Yep, no budget is fine. And I did see at the bottom, we have the, yeah… gross margin breakdown. Okay? And then above… we do have like the mix, oh, sorry, like percentages of total. So that's great. That sums to 100 percent. And then at the bottom, I know we have the individual gross margins. Yeah. Nice. All right. And we've got the bridges. All right. Cool. What are the contributors? Sorry, can you go up for me please? So we have the revenue, gross profit and operating profit.
Aishwarya D: Now, we can again, club these three in one with the dropdown that lets you switch from revenue to gross profit. But if you want to, if you want it to be side by side, then this would be better.
Brian W: Yeah. I know. I think I'd like to see everything in one. Yeah.
Aishwarya D: Yeah.
Brian W: And I know the names for companies get kind of long, so you can still read them though.
Aishwarya D: Yeah.
Brian W: And probably similar with like the dollar values, like I see on some of the bridges. There's no dollar values, but you.
Aishwarya D: Can always expand to.
Brian W: Yeah. Maybe it's just, it gets too cluttered, I guess.
Aishwarya D: Yeah.
Brian W: Yeah, these are formatting issues that I think we can worry about later.
Aishwarya D: Yeah, but that's the default that Domo?
Brian W: Okay. So then, sorry, maybe you said another way here for these bridges? Is there a way to maybe just make everything 100 thousandths place? Just one decimal point?
Aishwarya D: Yeah, this is at one decimal point right now.
Brian W: Or, I'm sorry, like change everything to just a 1,000,000? Oh, okay. In one decimal point?
Aishwarya D: Okay. We can change it to 1,000,000, but then it will be, I.
Brian W: Know we lose some detail here like that 113 K negative will just show as point one, and probably the next one will be point two. I think that's fine. And then if someone wants to blow it up, they can look at the actual dollar values, right? So, if you hover that over the 8,000,000 as an example.
Aishwarya D: Yeah.
Brian W: Yeah, it'll give you the exact amount which is fine.
Aishwarya D: Yes, yes. But the issue with that is if you are going to set it to a 1,000,000, then if we are aggregating or summing anything up, it essentially… acts as text because I'll be dividing the number by 1,000.
Brian W: And.
Aishwarya D: you won't get, so we can still turn it into integer, but you won't get the M at the end. So we'll have to mention it somewhere at the top that everything is in millions. So the M won't be visible.
Brian W: Okay.
Aishwarya D: So it'll just show you the number eight point zero.
Brian W: Point. Yeah. I actually think that's okay because we already have like on the, you know, the first and last bar, it is millions and maybe we can put a, to your point like a note here that, hey, this is all in millions, but you can hover over the individual bars to get your exact dollar amount.
Aishwarya D: Yeah, we can try that for the bridges and I'll let you know. Okay, cool.
Brian W: All right.

Benjamin P: I'm going to probably let will drive because he's been the one working on this primarily. And so he'll be, he just sent me a message that he's joining in just a second. So he's built out some things. We've worked together on some backend atls to get the data that we needed in the format that we needed to support the dashboarding that he's the dashboard that he's put together that hopefully will provide you with better visibility. It's certainly not 100 percent complete, you know, but I think he's made a lot of good progress and he's looking forward to hearing some of your feedback on what's been built and how we can enhance that provide better.
Greg H: Visibility. Yeah, I see the new data sets in there that you and him have put in. So… yeah, I was just hoping to get a quick update. Is there any questions I can answer? Cool? Actually, it looks like it is linked to some cards already.
Benjamin P: Yeah. He said he's going to be here in just a second. So I would like for him to which let's see if he's added you to that dashboard yet. Let's see if I can turn here. Okay? It doesn't look like he's given you access yet. So I'm going to go ahead and add you Greg to the it's in apps studio. So I'm going to go ahead and share this with you and hopefully he'll be joined here in just a second and he can sort of walk us through.
Greg H: Yeah. And I'm not sure if he'll have time to join today, but we have a new VP of it joining the organization today, Abraham Marquez. So I forwarded him this invite just to see if he had time to pop in.
Benjamin P: Okay. Is that is Eric no longer with the company?
Greg H: Yeah. So Eric is the CFO and he, while we had a vacancy, he was filling in gotcha.
Benjamin P: Gotcha.
Greg H: So, Abraham's going to help, you know, make sure all… our projects and strategic alignments are there between all. Like we're relatively given our small size. We're a relatively complex organization with multiple emrs and billing systems and everything. And each of those has their own like owner, right? And so there's a lot of competing priorities. So, yeah, it becomes challenging.
Benjamin P: Awesome. So, did you say he was going to be able to hit or he couldn't join today?
Greg H: I don't know. I forwarded it to him. I don't know, I mean, it's his first day, so I'm sure he's drinking from the fire hose, being with a lot of people. So I don't know if he'll have time to jump in, but I did forward it to him just in case.
Benjamin P: Okay. Wonderful. Yeah, we're looking forward to meeting him and hopefully we can get this credit stuff under control. So you guys feel good about it because we're certainly looking forward to understanding more about your existing architecture and ways that we can fit into that to provide some additional value to your company. So we're looking forward to that. Yeah.

William W: Of course, are you one of those guys that doesn't want the labor? They just want the baby, Greg, or do you want me to give you a little peek behind the curtain? Yeah?
Greg H: A little peek behind the curtain is fine. Okay? So I can understand like how it's pulling it all together all.
William W: Right. So I'm going to start with like base level nerd talk if I need to dial it back, let me know and if I need to crank it up because you feel like I'm patronizing you a little bit, let me know.
Greg H: You're all good?
William W: Okay. So you guys are obviously familiar with Delmos stats, there's a few of them that you guys had. So I can tell you guys are already like pulling from them, Greg. I can tell you really dig looking at this stuff. A lot of them were owned by you. So we did peel off the ones that we already had in here just so you guys know like we're not creating trash in the backend, we did leverage what we could, and then the ones that you didn't have, we did pull in. So the key ones that you'll want to know this dataset, lineage one is pretty cool. It's incredibly custom. And the part that might trip you up a little bit, maybe talk with chat gpt is this python script that we're running. And ultimately, what we're trying to determine is, you know, what's our quote, unquote cost per dashboard and we're rolling that up on a per card basis. Certain cards will involve multiple steps of lineage in order to generate them, you know, it'll start at a data source. It'll go through a data flow and then it'll maybe we're hosting it inside of a view. Although I will say you guys aren't using a ton of data?
Greg H: Yeah, we don't really use, yeah, as we talked before, we're not really leveraging views yet just because, yeah, it wasn't there when we were.

Ashish C: All geared up and ready… for the school year. Now that summer's over, is it officially over for you yet?
Sam D: Yes, we started late last week, so, couldn't be any happier. Yeah. How about you? I'm with you?

Ashish C: Sorry, Labor Day. Sorry. Yeah.
Sam D: Yeah, no, I know what you meant. Yeah.

So, you feel like, you know, the clock is like really not on your side as opposed to like, oh, you know, we've got Labor Day weekend, you know, we've got the Labor Day sales we got, you know, we get to stay, hang in and take advantage and get everything locked and loaded. Growing up for us, it was always after Labor Day, and now it's before, and it actually varies by town too. Here in the state. It's not every town. Yeah, not every town is the same. So, like my best friend lives in a different town that started after Labor Day, but they also get out, I think a few days later than we do. So, it all kind of works out in the end. It's just really the same amount of days, yeah. But yeah, no, like, very excited about it. And so far, so good. Knock on wood.
Ashish C: Nice. Yeah.
Sam D: How's the palisade? Treating you?
Ashish C: Oh, yeah. It's I mean, my wife loves it like she, I think we talked about how migrating from a minivan is a big step, but she doesn't even notice the sliding doors anymore, not being there. I think it's yeah, it's a lot more luxury living. So, I think she got used.
Sam D: to it pretty quick. What's the, what was the minivan that you guys had?
Ashish C: The odyssey?
Sam D: Yeah, that's classic. It's always usually like odyssey or sienna, you know? Yeah. One or the other, I heard that the downside of the odyssey is no vents in the rear. Is that true and lack of cup holders?
Ashish C: Yeah. There's not vents in the very rear. There's vents in the middle row. Yeah.
Sam D: I think you're right? Yeah. So everyone always complains about those two things. Not enough cup holders and no vents in the back. Yeah, but, I tend to like the styling of the odyssey better than the styling. The sienna feels a little bit more. It's not as like, I guess aggressive looking or cooler. Yeah, my best friend has a sienna like anniversary edition like he just went all out. I will not drive a minivan if I can help it. You have four kids. You kind of, it's tough. Yeah. So, it's like, you know?
Ashish C: Oh, you can get away with it. Yeah.
Sam D: Yeah, absolutely. So. But that's yeah, that's cool. I've definitely been looking myself and palisade is definitely, I, like, I think I mentioned to you last time we talked like, I like what hyundai is doing. I like the palisade. I like the santa Fe. I like the, the ioniq, five, you know, they're just doing a good job. Yeah. You know, they're definitely very competitive and they, whoever's designing their car is doing a great job, you know? Yeah. So, good choice for sure. Yeah. So you love it. Yeah, that's good. I thought, you know, I thought that, I don't know if we've spoken since our call with, you know, Ben, and Mohamed, I did know, I did notice. You guys had, a little bit of a organizational change recently where Mohamed is no longer your chief data officer. But now, what's referred to as your chief strategy officer. I didn't know if you guys just felt like you didn't need a CDO or if, like, what's the, I don't know if you're, free to share, but like, what was the I'm, sure it was communicated, you know, what was the driving sort of or method to the madness there? I?
Ashish C: Don't know if they necessarily shared reasons behind the move. I mean, anytime I've worked with Muhammad, he's a, very well, I mean, he's a very strategic thinker, yes, he understands the back end data. But I think Domo is in a space where there's a lot of navigation, needed with the suite and platform that we have, touches, a lot of other vendor solutions that are more siloed, how do we navigate within, you know, that space is, has always been difficult for Domo. And so, I think, we used to have, a C, I guess a CTO or CSO, that's helped us navigate. He came from Amazon, and was doing similar types of, work around Domo and missing. And then he went off to another role with another organization missing that, I think Domo lacked some of that guidance that we need through the ecosystem. Yeah. So I think they really wanted to fill that role and I think they just saw that moment, as a good fit. And, he comes from Mckinsey's. He comes from that line of thought. Yeah. So.
Sam D: It makes a lot of sense. Yeah, it made tons of sense. I was excited to see, you know, that he was chosen to fill that role. I don't know, I don't know how much, Domo really needs a CDO, you know, like I think Domo definitely needs a CSO more than they need a CDO. You know, but, maybe they'll backfill the CDO position. Maybe they, maybe they just felt like it wasn't really necessary, you know, and maybe, it was more impressive to just say you had one versus, you know, it actually providing your, you know, the organization with like utility. You know, I can absolutely see like Mohamed, like crushing it from a CSO standpoint. You know, like you said, he's he knows everyone, he, you know, he comes from that background. It makes a lot of sense. So, I don't know if like, I don't know who was part of his organization. Like I don't think like folks like Ben reported to him. You know, I don't know if Mohamed kind of just stood alone in the CDO space, you know, but I don't know, I don't know if they're building a team beneath him or if one already exists.

Michael N: Was in New York a couple weeks ago. It was like 105, yeah. In Manhattan. I was like my, and the humidity and I have no humidity out here in California. It's where I am. So it was a shock back to my system from when I grew up.
Bridget G: I'm sure. Yeah, we have humidity. We've actually, it's been quite nice though.
Michael N: Yeah.
Bridget G: So, anyway, well, good. Well, it's nice to connect. I know we've kind of planned this. I think we planned this a few weeks ago.
Michael N: Yes. Yeah. And I'll give you kind of a little bit of background on this, Bridget. So we've got a team inside of Domo, that was that we started. I want to say beginning of this year, maybe January, February Ish. And mark is part of that team, and Shane wright is part of that team and it's really to help our customers understand how to use Domo, get adoption within the organization, if things come up that you would want to be able to build, but don't know how to build it. Shane is a great resource. He'll actually jump in and help build some stuff. So, it's, a program for just a few of our accounts. And rob and I were able to, we were fortunate enough to be able to put in, three names of companies that we work with that we'd love to take part in this. And I thought of you guys right off the bat.
Bridget G: Awesome. Thank you.
Michael N: You're. Welcome. So, I wanted to introduce you to Shane and mark and I'll start with, actually, if we could, if you could do intros on your side, it'd be great, for that side of the house and, and then we can start with, with our side.
Bridget G: Sure. I'm Bridget Gola, I joined hearst about a year ago now, and I am their head of business intelligence. So we're doing all the data and analytical work here at hearst magazines on the magazine division. And partially why we're leveraging Domo right now, is for both, mostly for reporting, we were leveraging it a lot to house data, but we're transitioning a lot of our data out of, Domo into our warehouse into an analytical layer, and then repointing it back out to Domo, and building out dashboards for our leadership and for our, business teams cross functionally so that they can have the same views on all of our data. We can have one single source of truth. So that's primarily, my goal here at hearst is to ensure we're all looking at the same data and then also cleaning up a lot of our data within the magazine division to make it so that it's, more accessible for strategic decisioning outside of just regular, run the business type of reporting. And then Emily's here who's on my team? And, yeah, hi, I'm Emily, I am the manager of business insights. I have helped, been at hearst since 2018. So I was kind of with one of the first Jomo contracts. And I have helped get a bunch of our teams within the organization to adopt Jomo. And then now what we're trying to do is clean up what we had originally created because it was a bunch of people like me who aren't in like the engineering or like data side. So cleaning it up and making sure that everything is accurate, that we're getting the adoption and everything is looking as it should. So, helping doing a lot of the dashboards, the apps, to give our teams different visualizations of the data. Yeah. And Emily's, been instrumental in, helping a lot of the cross functional teams get the data that they need.

Ankit S: Good. It's nice to take it easy.

Ankit S: Get a break from some screen time?
Molly B: Yeah. I always say that I'm going to get a break from some screen time and then, you know, the weekend comes and I'm you know, I'm working on a project or I'm you know, playing a game. So, the break from screen time never really happens for me.
Ankit S: I agree. Yeah, that's like Saturday morning, it's kind of become like a ritual for me to just like take care of errands from my laptop.
Benjamin P: Yeah.
Ankit S: You know, on my couch with like a cup of tea or something, you know?
Molly B: Oh, that sounds nice. Actually.
Ankit S: It's nice if I don't… just jump for my laptop on a Saturday morning. I try to get.

Molly B: Yeah. Get out of the house. You're up in Delaware, right?
Ankit S: Yeah. Yep. That's correct. Yeah.
Molly B: Yeah, better than getting out of the house in Phoenix. I think it's like 110 here today?
Ankit S: Yeah, I mean, it's definitely hotter for you guys. I lived in Texas for a year, so, I remember this time of year.
Molly B: Oh, my gosh. Yeah. And you've got all that humidity in Texas? I'll take this over that.
Ankit S: Yeah. And I was in Austin too, which like it's probably not as humid as Houston, but like it was pretty humid.
Benjamin P: Yeah.
Ankit S: Yeah, Arizona seems a bit more pleasant.
Molly B: Yeah, no, it's nice down here.
Benjamin P: Yeah.

Ankit S: It comes from. That is pretty funny.
James L: Yeah, yeah, they're absolutely bananas.
Molly B: My place, I'm on the third floor and I can see them coming in from the east and it's really dramatic where it's just, oh, I don't even know how to describe it. It's like a fog, but of course, it's so dark. Yeah, it's just sand. Oh bananas. Yeah. Let me shoot James a message, make sure he can join.
Ankit S: Us. Sure. Yeah, I'll do the same with Ben.
Molly B: All right, James will be a couple minutes. Looks like he's wrapping up another meeting.
Ankit S: Yeah, Ben should be here in a few minutes as well.
Molly B: Great. So, what is our kind of itinerary for today? Are there some things that we want to discuss?
James L: Yes.
Ankit S: And I believe Ben has more of the agenda, but I'm going to double check in our notes. I know we're just, oh, there you are. Hey, Ben.
Benjamin P: Hello?
Ankit S: Molly was just asking about just agenda for today based on where we left off.
Molly B: Yeah, and I'll just say really quickly James is going to join us. He's just wrapping up a meeting. So it'll just be a couple more minutes.
James L: Yeah.
Benjamin P: Sounds good. Yeah. So agenda for today, I am still working on putting together the roadmap that we discussed last week, Molly, and basically that's just, we've discussed really two use cases where you guys have communicated that there would be high value in number one, the lead management tool. And then the other one is the tool for helping the doctors calculate their compensation. And so there's the two ones that are the highest priority right now. I am still working on putting that roadmap together. And then on our side, just as a formality, we'll sort of put together what we believe is sort of the statement of work based on the discussions that we've had and you guys just review that and sort of give us the go ahead. And from there we start execution. So still putting that together that's not to say that we can't you know, there's nothing that can be done today. We can still begin working towards the things that we'll need for those use cases, but just look for that to come in the next few days that document just because like I said, even though it's a free engagement, it's just sort of to ensure that we're working toward the same goal because at the end of it, we obviously want to build something that you guys have guided us toward. And based on the working sessions that we've had. So, does that make sense?
Molly B: Yeah, absolutely. Sounds great.
Benjamin P: Cool. So, I know that last week, you guys did give me access to the instance, right?
Molly B: Ooh, you know what? Let me check.
Benjamin P: What is the name of your instance? It's not resus, is it?
Molly B: It's very, simply resus? Dental.
Benjamin P: Okay. Well, that is not showing up in my browser when I start typing it, which means I've probably not ever been in your instance before excellent. So that would be a good first start.
Molly B: We'll get going. So, Ben, would you like access, and then Ankit, would you like it as well?
James L: Yeah, you.
Ankit S: Can give that to me as well, although Ben will be working inside of it more often, but yeah, if I need to get a hold on.
James L: Anything that's fine.
Molly B: Let's hold off. I can do that very quickly once we get the go ahead, I believe though. The reason that we held off was because we wanted to talk to our kind of legal team just to make sure that there's no reason in Domo that we shouldn't give access. So, oh, your shame's now.
Benjamin P: Hey, James.
Molly B: We're having technical difficulties today at the office.
Benjamin P: James.
Molly B: I was just saying that we discussed giving Ben Domo access last week and then we had held off because we wanted to talk to Dave green. Did we do that? Did you happen to do that? Because I did not… you are muted?
James L: Did you just ask me a question? Because I heard the last sentence? I apologize. No.
Molly B: Worries. I was just asking.

What's going on?
Benjamin P: Hey guys.
Molly B: How are you doing today, Ben?
Benjamin P: I am wonderful. How are you guys?
Molly B: We're always great. We are golden and sunny here in Arizona, finally cooling off a little bit.
Benjamin P: Good, good. Yeah, it's, it cooled. It's cooled off here, a little bit too, I'm in Georgia and it's, well, I mean, it's 80 right now, but the mornings have been in the low sixties, which is pretty cool for here. So.
Molly B: Yeah, yeah, that's right.
Benjamin P: Yeah. So, I wanted to show you some, I wanted to show you guys some progress that, has been made on the application. Awesome still work to do, but I think that there's, plenty to show here. So, I'd love to get your feedback. And, again, this is sort of, you know, we're still in development and there's still work to be done. So, any feedback that you have for me, anything that you see, that you would like, changed or anything that you like that you want me to keep, feel free to let me know, so that I can, be mindful of that feedback, while I'm continuing, to build this out, so.
James L: Very cool.
Benjamin P: All right. So, all right. So, we've got, well, one quick thing, before I dive in, and it may not be this way anymore, but I know when I came in this morning… so, this is the data set that I'm using and originally, we put in here, I guess it's taking a second load. But originally we put that we only wanted the last two days' worth, of data. And so I was filtering to just the last two days, and I don't know why it's taking forever to load. But historically, that's been just fine. You know, two days' worth has been just fine. But whenever I went in here this morning, the most recent call was from October second, which was two days ago. And so there was actually no data in the data set because the most recent data was two days ago, and we were filtering for the last two days. And so I increased it, to three days instead of two days so that it would actually pull in some data. And I don't know if it's still that way or if, maybe there's been an update to the data set since I looked at it this morning and maybe it's pulling in more recent data now, but I didn't know if there was a reason why the most recent date, or call was on October first or maybe it runs daily and it just had not run yet.
James L: It should be running like every 30 minutes throughout the day. So, let me just take a look to see if something broke.
Benjamin P: Okay.
James L: Although Domo seems to not be loading for me.
Molly B: Yeah, it's being slow for me too. Yeah.
Benjamin P: I don't know what in the world is going on here.
James L: Yeah, it's not loading the page that I have.
Benjamin P: Oh, yeah, it is okay. Well, we'll come back to that. In the meantime, so, here's the application. We had talked about having, tabs for the, the different, so all, we can have one for all calls, one for calls that have been unassigned, and one for, the assigned to me. Now, this is how, I was, I would put it in here, how it would look. These filters are actually not doing anything yet because I just added in the assigned to like five minutes ago because I just got access to that data. And so obviously, the assigned to me, I haven't implemented that yet because I just got the assignees, but the assignees are in here and so, I was able to get that in there. One thing that you'll notice as soon as you make a change to a row, if I change this to James, you'll see that it immediately highlights, the row and these buttons up here light up that will allow you to save, or you can cancel, if you cancel, then it will revert back to how it was and it'll remove the highlighting, but this is to quickly tell you that, you know, oh, there's something I need to save. So, would love your feedback on that. That was, I was trying to make this, you see that this button is disabled here. And so, I tried to make it visible enough to where, as soon as you make a change, it's it should be obvious enough that, there's something that has not yet been saved. So what do you guys think, of that function?
James L: Nice looks really nice. I love that. Yeah.
Molly B: I.
James L: like the little visual cues that something's not been saved.
Benjamin P: Okay, perfect. So, because what we'll do is if somebody chooses appointment scheduled here, then, we'll we will require them to put a value in, these final two columns here. And therefore, if, somebody makes a change, to a row and they put appointment scheduled and they haven't filled these two out yet. This will be disabled as it is here. So you can see it's disabled. So it'll look like that. And what I may actually do is if they, if somebody goes in here and chooses appointment scheduled, but these two haven't filled out yet instead of, I will still highlight the row. But instead of making it green, I may just make it red so that they can see that. Oh, there's yeah, there's I've made a change but it's not complete and therefore, I can't save. So I'll add that in there may even make the like the outline of these boxes red, these two red if they haven't filled them out. Just so it's very obvious that, okay, I can't save until I fill out the other two values. The tags, you can see they're different. So, last time the tags weren't you know, they didn't look like tags, but now they do. And so this is sort of what I intended for that. Once you save, the saving actually does work. So, if you save, then it locks that in. And then it gets rid of the green to show that it's saved. And you see, I added two tags here. So if I refresh, you'll see that it actually did retain the two tags that I put in here. So it is saving to the database and if it loads because obviously, we know that it's been slow with loading here in the last few minutes for some reason. Yeah.
James L: Domo must be down.
Benjamin P: I don't know this happened last week sometime too. I don't know what's going on.
James L: Yeah, because I can't really get any page to load.

Neil M: Hey, guys.
Jenna H: How are you?
Neil M: Good. How are you?
Jenna H: Good. Just getting started and sharing with the team that we are going to present the roadmap, which is what we've been working on since we became engaged on this project with the adoption engine and kind of outline our big plan, talk about what work has already been done and where we want to keep it going and just make sure that Domo and packsize is aligned and we're here to help support you and make this a really successful partnership… before we get into that. Neil. Do you have anything that you want to add or say?
Neil M: No, let's just get into it. I appreciate that opportunity. But good to see everyone, Jordan, Chris, John, thanks for taking the time.
Jenna H: Awesome. All right. Let me share my screen. So… here we're going to just start right in a high level conversation about who packsize is and what makes your company so impactful. And it's really that you're a pioneer in packing technology. But there's also this value of sustainability and operational excellence that I saw all over my research. Everything I read was talking about the focus and commitment to these two main values. And I think that is just awesome. The company's solutions are helping organizations worldwide minimize waste, operate more efficiently and deliver greater value to the customers. You'll see from the fast facts that we have here that packsize is recognized as a top workplace, has an impressive track record of innovation and makes a real quantifiable difference to their customer. You've been a Domo customer for over 10 years and with more than 1,100 users in 112 departments, your scale and maturity has a ton of significant opportunities. But as I think part of the reason we all know, we're here some unique challenges for your data driven growth. And this context is just really important to keep in mind as we talk about the adoption engine program, the strategic roadmap we put together is designed to really build on these strengths by leveraging Domo as not just a reporting tool but as a way to help you further innovation, streamline your operations and measure your business impact. So by aligning our initiatives with your mission, we really hope that this adoption program is going to ensure every step that we tackle on this roadmap delivers sustainable value for the organization and your customers. So getting into the roadmap here, it was a kind of multi stepped approach. We did a lot of talking at the front of our engagement. We started with some sandbox work, some databricks work, and then a lot of user talk with this group here talking about end users, how we wanted to operate, what the end goal is, business values, all of the things and I took all of this information as well as some research that I've done to kind of put together the foundation that we built our roadmap on top of. So… here, we have a timeline of five key business events at packsize. And for this adoption engine program to make a real impact, we wanted to anchor our roadmap in the company's big achievements. And so it's not just by improving reporting or analytics but to really focus on driving. Excuse me to really focus on the milestones here. And so what we want to do is look at from early expansion into the us market, and then moving on to your major partnerships to launching packnet cloud and building a connected automation ecosystem. Each of these big milestones really reflects packsize's drive to solve problems and deliver customer value. All of that to say, it's really important to keep that in mind as we talk about the adoption engine program. Because the roadmap we're presenting today is designed to reinforce all of these key components about this reputation for leadership and sustainability and all of this growth. I mean, between one, two, three, four new partners announced in 20 25 alone. And then the walmart packaging partnership. This is, some pretty big growth that you're experiencing. And we want to make sure that Domo, every Domo initiative that we really present to you today as part of this roadmap is aligned with these milestones making sure that packsize can really continue to keep achieving these big goals and being able to report out successfully on them before we jump into the company's business goals. How is all of this landing with everybody right now? Any questions? Anything that I've missed so far?
Jordan H: I don't think you've missed things. I think you've done a good job capturing where packsize has come and what our history looks like, at least in a quick view of that.
Jenna H: It was hard to pick five because I was going through your website and just looking at like the press releases and everything. And I was just like, I don't know how I narrow this down. There's so much here. But I think the innovation and the growth is such a key piece of it. And if we can get your instance organized and governed, that'll… just keep supporting this more and be able to help support measuring all of this continued growth, which I think is really awesome. Okay. So for the business goals, I know we talked about them a little bit and then we discussed at a high level, what is in your demo instance right now that really supports these goals?

Dylan C: Yeah, there was a couple times that I had to just take a step. I can't believe that I'm here watching this right now?
Signe P: That's like parenting right there. You're just sitting there like, what? Like the show is awful for an adult? Yeah, watching my kid so happy. I was like, okay.
Dylan C: Yeah, my daughter kept turning to me during it and being like, this is so great. Isn't it isn't this a good movie. I'm like, yeah, it's phenomenal.
Signe P: That's funny that's what we do for our kids.
Bryant M: How's it going Sarah?
Sam H: Good afternoon or? Yeah, I guess afternoon for probably most of us. Oh, I mean, maybe not, you guys might be still in the morning afternoon for here?
Bryant M: Awesome. Well, yes… I just kind of wanted to get your thoughts Sam. I mean, I sent the email and we already went through the auto renewal and I know we've had some conversations around the broadcast app with Dylan. So I just, yeah, I wanted to get your thoughts and maybe just start there.
Sam H: Yeah, I think so. I'm comfortable with the price the way it's at as long as it doesn't you know, as long as this is the year and that, you know, I'm not going to see any kind of surprises on expenses and things like that. Again, I know we talked about last of how you've kind of set up your licensing model and things like that. I absolutely have to have predictability so that if that number is the number for the year? Fantastic. And I'm good to go with it. If there is, well, in this case, if you do this or this, it goes up by 20 percent or stuff like that, then we've got a problem, but from what I saw, it didn't look like I saw any of that.
Signe P: So I'll jump in and do the fun part. We talked about. You had a retag that ended September thirtieth and with, and we sent, or we talked about that powerpoint we had on that other call where we take the last three months in the trend on how you're using Domo and we forecast it and say, if you continue to use Domo like this, then you're going to need. And I think it was an additional 122,000 credits.
Sam H: Yeah, right. I don't know what that means to me yep.
Signe P: So, with that, so far, you have 20,000 or 27,000, 698 credits available for the whole year. So far you've used, we're not even halfway through the month. You've almost used 5,000 credits. So that is right in line with our prediction. You're going to need 120,000 more credits and 95 cents each additional.
Sam H: So it's a plain math. I mean, at the end of the day, I'm looking at 80,000 dollar renewal. Is it 80,000 dollars for the year or is it not 80,000 dollars for the year? I mean that's what I need. Brass tacks. Nothing else. I know how much Power BI is for our, you know, it needs to be in line if it's not in line with what Power BI is. This will be the last renewal we do. So that's what I've got to understand. I get licensing is a pain in the butt, but I've got to have predictability in my business. Otherwise, you're not the partner for me.
Signe P: So we have the predictability, we forecasted it. We know it, how you're using Domo, what it's going to cost. So it's kind of on your side to say, how are we using Domo? Is this how we want to continue using Domo? Do we want to cut down on how often things are being refreshed? I'm just telling you what the data is saying and you're going to need it is an additional spend. So take 95 cents times 122,000 is the additional cost that you would need? So we can partner with you and figure out?
Sam H: That's three times the cost of what I'm paying today. I mean, that's 127,000 dollars more on what we're paying exactly. Come on. I mean, we've gone through this with Microsoft on how we use it and things like that. It's not 200,000 dollars for Power BI to do the same function. So I don't get where this is how this is so difficult to have a competitive product, competitive market offering at the same price with you guys.
Signe P: Yeah. So it's all in how you're using Domo on your side. So if those are conversations, I mean we can work with Dylan and say what are some things that we can do to optimize, which I think that we've done before, but it's how you're using Domo, it tracks it trends. We also though with the broadcasting use case and I don't know how much Dylan has shared, but we've been able to come up with the concept of the app. We would love to be able to partner with you. We have our team on standby to be able to finish the specs on that. And what that looks like. I think we've given or Dylan gave us a soft thumbs up like that. We're heading in the right direction. So we feel confident with that. We just have to partner with you more on what that looks like.
Sam H: Fair enough. We can walk through all that stuff. The first thing is if there isn't a solution here that's less than 200,000 dollars, we've got to do something different. So before we even talk about trying to add anything or do other additional functionality. It's got to be close to 80 K for what our use case is for what our needs are. If it's not close to 80 K, then we're wasting our time.
Signe P: And Dylan, I don't know if you have any feedback on that, I know that we've done some optimization. Is there other things that we can do to partner with you to slow things down or how you're currently using it that's kind of on your side to be able to help us and guide us on how we can partner with you on that? But just get your feedback?
Dylan C: Yeah. One thing that would be helpful is if, what is the kind of the reduction that we need to get to in order to make it kind of flat year over year based on? Because then I can look at the data sets and be like, okay, because I know which ones are kind of crucial and we went through that once before, but I think then we need to have a l",Consumption Pricing Model,79500.58,Corporate,FOXWORLDTRAVEL.COM,7,Travel & Transportation,260,$50M to <$100M,Renewal,Blank,Closed Won,Bryant Masina,2025-10-01,2024-07-02,2024-07-02,2025-09-19,2025-09-19,2025-09-19,2025-09-19,,0015000000yBhXJAA0

Leaf Health is looking for features like historical note tracking, automated task creation, and the ability to generate reports for top opportunities by TPA. Domo will explore custom builds and leverage existing functionalities like task center workflows to meet Leaf Health's needs.
","Sonja D: hey, Jeff.
Jeff A: He is gone.
Sonja D: Dead. thank you.
Manya D: Hey, Sonia.
Sonja D: Hey, how are you? Good?
Manya D: How are you?
Sonja D: I'm good. Let me introduce you to Jeff, Jeff's our pharmacist, he's going to be driving a lot of these requirements for this particular project that we're talking about right now, great.
Manya D: Wonderful meeting you, Jeff.
Jeff A: Yes, nice to meet you.
Sonja D: So, today, we've got a couple of projects for this particular, I… guess effort, but let's start with the one that I think is going to be easier to knock off and I will share my screen so you can get a starting point and a visual, and then I want to just double pull my email up so that I can reference it because I mean, I gave the high level requirements, but that's where Jeff comes in. So give me one second email. Yeah. So this is the email… and it is the second kind of project here where we're capturing the patient referral in that form. And then… after that, we, there's a workflow that we either let's just explore what that workflow looks like and then build the requirements off of that. Because just at a high level, Jeff, do you want to explain what your process is? And I'll pull this up? This is an example of a list of referrals. And so I'm just going to pull one of the referrals up here and then have you kind of walk through once you get that referral, what exactly do you do?
Jeff A: Yeah. So I mean pretty much, so I've got, you know, the referral they submit is kind of all the information I need to kind of reach out to providers' offices and whatnot. So pretty much all I'm doing is my workflow is I'm talking to offices. We're trying to, you know, ship meds into an office. But basically when I'm calling offices or talking to people, you know, it can be a lot of leaving messages or waiting for call backs or, you know, finding out new information. So it's a lot of kind of like adding in my own like workflow notes kind of things. So one thing we're looking for or I guess two things is one, this is kind of like an example of what Sonya's made is like, you know, we look at a patient and kind of brings it up here at the top, right? As like kind of some of the information for the case. The other option could be as if, you know, we pick Beverly Franklin, I Qlik on them. Maybe it brings up a whole new page that it's a full patient kind of view or profile or tab. But in either case, one of those views, but I need a section to kind of add in like notes that are kind of ongoing notes. Okay?
Sonja D: Hey, Jeff. Quick question for you. Sure. Would there be, a use case for a dropdown field to get a status? Like is there a specific like in progress closed? You know, or whatever I mean? Is there anything that?
Jeff A: Yeah, we both, I do kind of use statuses now. So, yeah, I think we'll add in a status section… cause what I'm imagining is like, yeah, we could have statuses like new. I guess in progress. A status could be like a side of care change, needed things like that. And so I'm kind of bouncing between ideas of possibly, would it be possible to have like a kind of like a maybe a dashboard or something where I can sort by task but also be able to maybe sort by due date? I can manually put in these due dates like if I were to call an office today and I had to leave a message, you know, I don't want to like forget about it. I want to set a task for myself to follow up in like two days. If I don't hear anything back. I'm kind of bouncing around a bunch of ideas but yes, to answer your question. Yeah, we definitely need to add in a status section. I know one of the pieces in here is like dose due date, but I need like a task due date for myself as well to maybe keep track of, you know, when I need to be following up again on certain cases.
Manya D: Do you just want that the task due date is like just in the table or the other option is that we could also just create an actual user task using our workflows tool. So like there's a separate like task management section that we have… if like you want to track your to dos there or, yeah, do you just want it to be in the main table?
Jeff A: I could, I don't know what the task management system looks like. I mean possibly.
Manya D: Let me pull.
Sonja D: It up.
Jeff A: Okay.
Manya D: It's pretty intuitive and it's like we can very clearly define how you want that task to be. It can send you like regular notifications like if, for an upcoming thing or something like just email notifications? Thank you. So it's… I'm just pasting the link for that in the chat. Okay? It's the help article. That kind of just walks you through what it is and like how to set it up and stuff like you wouldn't need to worry about that, but you can kind of like get an idea of what that interface looks like. And in the app, it's like if you're using the Domo app to monitor those, it's… also like super easy there.
Jeff A: Yeah, I think, right. I think I may, maybe we could even almost use like both. Like if I could use these tasks because I think it's kind of helpful in two scenarios. Like I can, if I'm just working off of something or working off the task list, I can be, you know, whatever status they are, whatever task types, or maybe I can manually name them or something, but I could be working off the task list. But then also I want to be able to maybe if I were to like this view we're looking at right now like that Sonia's sharing say we Qlik on Beverly Franklin. Like if a provider were to call me back and I'm like, okay, let me pull up Beverly Franklin and I pull her up. I want to be able to Qlik into her profile here kind of like this view here or maybe it, you know, brings us to a separate screen. I want to see all, you know, pending tasks for Beverly Franklin. That way I can, you know, that task will be like, you know, following up on, you know, talking to the provider about shipping in the med. I can be like, okay, yes, that's what they're calling back about. So it's kind of like the task would show on like both views.
Manya D: Yeah. And we could do that too.
Jeff A: Okay. Yeah. As long as they link, I think that'd be perfect because tha",Consumption Pricing Model,102500.3,Corporate,LEAFHEALTH.NET,1,Retail,18,< $5M,Renewal,Blank,2: Determine Needs,Ashish Cardwell,2028-01-27,2025-01-22,2025-01-22,,,,,,001Vq000003OIyGIAW

Simon N: That sounds like fun. I'm always so jealous of all the summer birthdays. I'm like a mid November and it's like dark and cold and there's no pool parties on my birthday. Yeah. All right. Well, we have Jaran on so we can dive in a little bit, but appreciate the updates on all that. And for the quick turnaround on that, so.
Jaran P: Hey,
Sarah C: how's it going? Thanks for fixing Germany yesterday.
Jaran P: No worries. I'm like something has to be off here because everything is working, right?
Sarah C: Yeah, it was just weird and so it was the decimal.
Jaran P: Yeah, yeah. So in Germany, I guess they can have multiple more than two. And so the form, how is it built? Is it accepts more than two decimals? But when you go to submit, it says, oh, wait. This doesn't make sense. It should only be two decimals. There's more than two. So it doesn't let you submit. Yeah, I updated the form, so that accepts everything now.
Sarah C: Oh, great.
Jaran P: Okay. Cool. Sorry, I didn't even get a chance to do the UK homepage yet?
Sarah C: Oh, okay.
Jaran P: I can send that over to you. I did see your email about the Germany translation.
Sarah C: Yes. And he texted me, he tested the dashboard. It works great now. So he's good there. And then he also said he wants to double check his benchmarks tomorrow or this week, he'll have the benchmarks to his Monday.
Jaran P: Okay. Got it. Okay. Cool. So once we get that… let me think, I think we can start on the dashboard. Yeah, we can get started on the translations, but I don't think we need to wait for him for that. I know ash is out today and tomorrow though, but we can get started on that and have that ready for next. Let's see, yeah, next Thursday for sure, but then once we have it ready, I'll just, I'll add you to the page and then you can just check it and then Italy… do you have any updates on that?
Sarah C: Yeah, I emailed Italy. I emailed them yesterday and I haven't heard from them.
Jaran P: Okay. No worries. So.
Sarah C: We'll get Italy and then we should be good.
Jaran P: Okay. Yeah, once they send it, we'll just quickly do it.
Sarah C: Right.
Jaran P: Yeah, that works. Okay.
Sarah C: And I think that's it for right now. Yeah. And I think once all the dashboards are done or at least we're in a good spot, then we'll start working on the PDP and then, you know, we discussed a little bit yesterday, potentially looking at properly page, breaking everything for when we export to PDF. I don't know, I mean, that's not a priority.
Jaran P: Okay. Yeah. I was thinking about that. I'm trying to think of a more like efficient way to do it because like this is only going to grow and then I don't want to have to come back and continue to update those page breaks each time.
Sarah C: Right.
Jaran P: There's there's like things. I'm pretty sure there's things we can do to like automate the process somehow.
Sarah C: So, okay.
Jaran P: I just shared the UK dashboards with you. I'll share the homepage with you as well. You have the homepage, I'll update the homepage after this call, but you have access to that?
Sarah C: Wonderful. That would, yeah, that's great. And I'll share that back, with the other, with the UK Guy, John, and then I'll have him start testing it and then hopefully we won't run into any issues?
Jaran P: Yeah. Okay. Cool. Sounds good. I think we're good then. All right. I think.
Sarah C: We're good, cause I mean, we kind of talked yesterday cause there was that little drama, but I think everything else is fine.
Jaran P: Yeah. Okay. Cool. All right. If there's anything else, you can just email me and help you out.

Dalton C: School as in college or?
Neil M: Yeah, yeah, college. Yeah.
Dalton C: Where at?
Neil M: I'm in California. He's at a state school like two hours from here called, chico state. They were famous like the eighties as being like the number one party school in the us. So I was a little, I was a little anxious about it, but they've done a lot to change their ways.
Stacey J: When I was growing up, my aunt lived in Paradise, so we drove, yeah, flew out to, I would spend most of my summers out there. So, obviously the Paradise fires, she moved from out to Colorado before them, but, yeah. So, we, my cousins all went to chico state. So it's.

For this call and maybe it's we use it just to, I think you've met Nathan before. Has anyone on the eight Leven side met Nathan or just you Andy?
Andy D: I think Dalton has, I mean, we met, I think he briefly met everyone in the lobby at Domo palooza, but yeah, I've primarily been working with Nathan before.
Neil M: Yeah.
Nathan E: Good to see you, Andy. Hey.
Andy D: You too man.
Nathan E: For Dalton and Stacey, I'm Nathan enderly been at Domo for 10 and a half years. I lead our AI sales practice, so I get the opportunity to work with most of our customers when they're either building or looking to build data, science, machine learning or AI solutions.
Andy D: Right.
Neil M: Yeah. So we took that, thanks, Nathan and we took that feedback. Stacey, did I come from you or from meg? I can't remember now I.
Stacey J: Came from meg. She talked to the recruiters about.
Neil M: it. Yeah. So we took that feedback and we shared that with Nathan early in the week or end of last week and thought it'd be a good time just to have him come on and do a little bit more, I guess a little bit more discovery but it seemed like from that email, there was some… concerns. I don't know if concerns is the right word, but let's use the word concern around. Sort of like what we would hope to achieve… you know, is the juice worth the squeeze kind of thing. So, I don't know Andy, it looks like you've got something you want to add there, but that's why I just thought maybe take, you know, 10, 15 minutes and just dig into like what we could do next to kind of think through like what the solution could look like. But again, just appreciate that feedback.
Nathan E: Yeah. From what I read on the notes shared, there seemed to be some kind of pointed concerns on specific challenges we might encounter in building an AI tool that worked for somebody. But Andy, could you just maybe catch me up on like your ideal state for an AI solution?
Andy D: Well, we have a bunch and honestly, Dalton's been talking with Casey and some other people so he might be a better individual. So fielder's choice. I can go into the solution that we were initially talking about and talk about it's. Not the AI's fault. It's more like for that particular instance, it was more a matter of how much is this really going to sway the needle for the user themselves, right? And granted, it was a sample size of three people who are more tenured, probably a little more set in their ways in terms of how they go about things et cetera. So I don't know if point being, I don't know if it would be the best avenue initially. So I think having Dalton talk about some of the other ideas… that we had. I think one, we'll go ahead, Dalton. Why don't you take that away in terms of other options… that we could focus on?

Signe P: It does. I didn't I wasn't always on the customer side. So they let me kind of grow and figure out where I fit best. So, even though it's been 13 years, I feel like I've been at like five different companies. So that's.

I did some independent consulting as well.

Time flies, but it's actually my second tour at truckstop. I've actually been with truckstop. I started their data science and analytics department a while back in like… as their senior director of data science and analytics, kind of just built that from the ground up. But, you know, before I joined, it was just really one person using Domo and then it became like a team of like 22 data scientists, data engineers and business intelligence folks.

Nik K: Katie. How are you?

Katie O: Little sweater on. So. Hello? Hey, Tim.
Tim K: How are ya?
Katie O: Good. How are you doing?
Tim K: Oh, good. Good. Thanks for keeping me up to speed. I've been jumping around a bit. How's the doctor… Nick until you tell me otherwise, I call you the doctor.
Katie O: Oh, okay. I didn't know where the, no.
Tim K: Nick is, the doctor, see he marks his handler and he gets like the room all set the patient set. He makes sure like he puts some big words, left knee. So, Nick doesn't screw around and put surgery on the right knee. That would.
Nik K: Be it on surgeon, but yeah, doctor works.
Tim K: That would.
Katie O: Be not a terrible way to be described, Nick, so.
Tim K: I mean, dude, you, like, I mean, I got to tell you to mark, I don't know if he likes that. He doesn't get all the glory, but I mean, you know, Nick, the doctors make good money, but the handlers, like, he's kind of, he's… got a ton of value. Like, I mean, I'll be candid. I've seen some other project management type stuff that just has me, you know, like I didn't realize I was a project manager. Let's put it that way. But yeah, I call him a doctor. And Katie, in the case of fidelity, he comes just like the patient comes out with a new, you know, replacement knee at fidelity. Nice new shiny dash. Nice, new shiny haystack… experience that's pulling pushing the right needles in the right places, which is getting back to the doctor analogy.
Katie O: There you go. I like it. Tim. I like it.
Tim K: Yeah. So, the doctor at some point might need a sports psychologist. I know Justin might know somebody who can help on that side.
Justin Z: Sure. Do charges a hefty hourly rate though. So you gotta be with that.
Tim K: Oh, yeah. I'd be willing to bet there are some parents who probably pay more than some professional teams for that type of access… would be just a guess, but yeah, no, I always, at some point, we gotta get together and hear more stories. Gotta make a huge difference. Everything's easy. I love what is his like best advice Justin?
Justin Z: He's the biggest hypocrite in history. You don't.
Tim K: don't wanna listen to him. Yeah, I think all parents, I mean, all children say that about their parents. So, yeah, your kids are younger than mine, I think, but I hear that. What else?
Justin Z: I mean, it's because he's so broad in his specialty, right? He was literally the, you know, the head of sports science, right? So he's paying attention to not just mental but like what's your blood, what's your sleep? What's your, this, what, right? So, his advice is always just sort of generically right around, you know, being as prepared as you can be for the moment, right? Whether that's mentally sort of visualizing things before they happen, whether that's knowing how to breathe when you're you know, sort of getting all fired up or anxious, to be better prepared to perform, whether it's sleep, whether it, you know, like, it's all over the board. But yeah, there's no magic pill to, you know, don't be a psycho and… you know, calm yourself down, and just sort of, you know, be ready, you know, be at your best, to perform. And a lot of that is just preparation and sort of, you know, making sure, you know, what to do. Like his latest thing is about scanning, right? No, wait, who is this? It's my dad.
Katie O: Okay. That's what I thought but I wasn't 100 percent sure. I was not a part of this initial conversation when y'all had it. Yeah.
Justin Z: So, so, he was the, he was the head, of performance for the Vancouver canucks for a few years when he left. Oh, when he left BU, yeah. And he's worked for like the Spanish world cup, you know, soccer teams, he's done, you know, he's done a ton of a ton of cool stuff, the celtics, whatever, right? Like he's just had, a good gig to the point where it should have been zakowski LLC. And I should not be at fidelity. I should have just done what he did and, you know, enjoyed that career?
Tim K: And I know Justin, we got a bunch of topics. I want to ask one, one question though, just, do your kids play sports? And is he, if so, is he allowed to talk to them after the game?
Justin Z: Oh, he's definitely allowed to, I don't restrict, his act. I mean, he is after all right, a world class, right? Teacher. So, I'm certainly going to let him tell, you know, tell my kids whatever he wants to tell them. I think they will ignore him as much as they ignore me, right? It's just that like that was, that's the speech I'll always remember in the car, right? Like just not listening to him, and he just lost it. He's like, you know, jfc, I don't know, right? People pay me thousands of dollars a day and I can't get my own kid to listen to my advice, right? It's just ridiculous, right? And he like went off the deep end, but I mean, justifiably so, I'd say, right? In hindsight,
Tim K: I'm a.
Justin Z: Mature adult and understand all the wisdom and experience he actually had. And to be as dismissive as I was, right? It's just, but that's what kids do to parents. So, I certainly don't feel any shame or guilt around being dismissive of him because everybody is, but in hindsight, it would have been more productive to actually pay attention. But that's probably true about most parents' advice that you're not paying attention to.
Tim K: Yeah. And this will be the last one. But all the years of coaching I did with my kids, they had a great thing in medfield where they had all these athletes like former olympians and they say, hey, let's talk about the culture and the good of the kid. And honestly, one of the best advice was, no, you don't talk about the game on the way home. And I could see a grandparent no matter what. You only see them for that one hour. And they just dive right in. Oh, yeah. My dad never got that one. He's like, what do you mean? You can't talk about it? What else are we going to do?

Karl A: The weather was perfect. Yeah, it was really nice out there. Good stroll. And, yeah, I guess it's proven that we can go up there by train, do the hike and then come back. So we'll do more of this.
Joe P: Same day, best of both worlds. You're back in the city, you'll get some outdoors and it's awesome.
Karl A: Yes, exactly. And there were some people who were going up to the Ren faire, you guys know what a Ren faire is.

Joe P: To get dressed up?
Karl A: Probably not. I don't think I will.
Michael N: My wife's from santa Cruz, California, every day is a renaissance faire there.
Karl A: Well, Ren faire is like super interesting for us because I'm pretty sure it is a uniquely American thing. So, we're very, you know, interested to see a bit of the new, like a new side in American culture for us.
Joe P: That's very cool.
Michael N: You know, the more you dig into American culture, the less you're going to like it. The more you're going to cherish your Australian and your UK roots.

Michael N: It's awesome.
Karl A: It is hard to get to, actually, I think that the train doesn't go all the way,
Michael N: Okay.
Karl A: I don't remember, or maybe I was thinking of a different like, no, I'm pretty sure this is lake placid, like people fly in there, don't they,
Michael N: yeah. And they drive up because it's the olympic center. So, it's where they had the winter olympics in 1980, and you've got whiteface mountain, which is gorgeous. The, hockey arena. The olympic hockey arena is amazing. And you can, if you guys like to skate, you could skate there. It's just, it's a great town. The U. S, I don't know if they still do. Joe might know.

Michael N: Placid, it was indeed.
Joe P: Yeah. Okay.
Michael N: Yep. The U. S won the gold medal in hockey.
Joe P: I mean, I obviously wasn't born yet, but.
Michael N: Shut up, Joe.
Joe P: Okay. I might've been maybe.
Michael N: I was, I remember watching that I was, 12 years old. I am o LD a S.
Joe P: Carl, you might not be aware of that history as a non… U. S native, but it was a, it was a big hockey game between the U. S and the soviet union. It wasn't the gold medal game, but it was, you know, obviously with the cold war and all that stuff. It was a, it was a really big deal.
Michael N: Yeah.
Karl A: And, sorry, the states won.
Michael N: They did, we did. Yeah, and it was the first time that we beat the soviet union since the 1960 olympics.
Karl A: And right.
Michael N: Before, so, two weeks before the olympic hockey game against the Russians, the U. S invited the Russians to play in Madison square garden, and they beat us like 15 to four… wow. And then, and then we came back to beat them in the medal round to advance to the gold medal against Sweden. I think.
Karl A: Bless.
Michael N: just a little bit of hockey, U. S hockey history.
Karl A: Well, it would be nice to get up there anyway. Go ice skating.
Michael N: Yeah, it's beautiful. So, I work with one of my customers is the New York state olympic committee. And the Guy that I was talking to on Friday said that the, the leaves are starting to change color up there already.
Karl A: Yeah, the leaves were changing color on the, on the hike as well, not all of them but certainly some of them.
Michael N: Yeah, it's beautiful.
Karl A: Yeah, it's a good time. Yeah.
Michael N: So, what do you got going this week?
Karl A: So, so… this week, there's a lot of discussions with, some of our other users of Domo, the, the med, coms, so.
Michael N: Excellent.
Karl A: Yeah, look, it is good. So one of them, we are feeling out if they want to build some more stuff in Domo?
Michael N: I think.
Karl A: With these guys, you know, how you sent me the traction training stuff like months ago. I'm going to look at what we can reuse from there. I think, you know, the biggest, challenge that I face when, talking about Domo to the, to like business users, is the full scope of what you can do with Domo. I think most people tend to think of it as just as visualizations and, and dashboards, and maybe like excel on steroids, but really the full scope of what's possible on Domo goes far beyond that and, and I don't know it's like it would be nice if there was… I don't know like examples or a cheat sheet, something like that. I mean, for example, with galderma, we have process automation, on top of just the visualizations, but even with them, I feel like we're only scratching the surface.
Michael N: Yeah. What's your, what are you thinking?
Karl A: I don't know. Yeah… I don't know it's like, you… know, we, there's like that.

How are you? Good. How are you doing well? Thanks. Are we waiting on anybody else from your team or is it just gonna be you today?
Veronica G: Probably just me.
Tyler C: Okay, perfect. I know Neil's out of town but I wanted to make sure we can cover this and so I told him I was like, hey, we should be able to just talk about it. And then if we need to, I can go back and like explain any differences or just kind of we can retouch after this after we get back. Kim and I are traveling to go see some other clients. And so I'm leaving tomorrow. So I will see him tomorrow and Wednesday. So if I do need to pass over any information more than happy to do so… mainly wanted to jump on and clarify and just talk about, your email where you're going through the credits and talking about like legacy credits and standard credits and just make sure we're all on the same page with that… one thing. So I guess just to jump into it. So it looks like you guys have been cleaning up a lot, which is great. You guys are in your re tag period still, right? Which is anything you clean up after on that re tag date. Essentially, we just take everything that you're using and then re tag it as legacy again. So in your example, right? If you've cleaned up, looks like you cleaned up like 540,000 and there's like, you know, a 1,000,000 left over type of situation. If you then had like, you know, 40,000 credits in standard, those would get re tagged as legacy and then essentially, your standard would then become free again to use. It looks like Simon's jumping in as well.
Veronica G: I misunderstood. Hey, Simon. Where are you? Hey? Okay. Tyler, would you just say that bit again? Great?
Tyler C: Yeah. I'm more than happy to. So we're just talking Simon. We're just talking about the legacy credits and kind of how that works with re tag. And so I'm going to use smaller numbers just because in my brain, it makes it easier to understand. So let's say we had 100,000 legacy that we were given, right? Let's say you guys cleaned up 50,000, which puts you at 50,000 out of your 100,000. But then you generated 40,000 standard credits during that re tag period upon the re tag date. Essentially, what happens is we say, okay, this 40,000 now becomes legacy. So then you would be using 90 K out of the 100 K and then you're essentially your standard becomes refreshed to where anything new that you create after that day would then start to use more standard credits. But anything created within that legacy period will be re tagged as legacy. So.
Simon G: Anything we create up until November 20 ninth, whatever the date is counts as legacy credits.
Tyler C: Yeah. After the re tag date, it'll be re tagged, yes. And.
Simon G: Then off on the 20 ninth… it will, we create a new data flow, new data set that will count to stand new standard credits, right? That is all standard. Those say we're using on, we use 50,000 legacy credits on that date with in total those extra 50 and we've got 100,000 legacy credits in total. That remaining 50 K is just a legacy credit, right? That, that doesn't move towards standard. It just remains legacy. Yes, as those legacy data sets create more like say we don't touch them or we maybe like add a field, right? That's all within the use cases for legacy data. We can add a field, modify it's like, you know, it's still the same data set. Those will use more of that data, those legacy credits. Is that right?
Tyler C: Yep. That's correct. Yeah. So any, anything you change on the legacy stuff, whether you're adding other fields or if you're turning up or down like how often they run, that's going to pull from legacy. First? The only time, that might pull from standard is let's say you turn, you switched everything to every 15 minutes, right? And now we're generating a lot more legacy credits. If that goes above how many we've given you that would start to pull from standard. But with how much it sounds like you guys cleaned up like you guys can continue to add a little bit more and then still have like a little bit of wiggle room, right? Because we do want to try and make sure you guys are set up well for, hey, if we just need minor changes here and there, or maybe we do need to turn this piece up a little bit, then that's fine. You can go turn that piece up and you still have a little bit of wiggle room or if you guys start getting close because you've created a whole bunch of new stuff, you can still always go back and turn down other legacy things that maybe don't need to run as often and then turn up other legacy pieces. But it is fully separate to where the legacy can't be used for standard. And the standard only comes into play if you go over your legacy amount, which you guys have a pretty good size amount to where you guys can have some wiggle room to do a lot of that?
Veronica G: How about rows that are associated with legacy credit? Because that's I think where we're going to run into trouble… is like this year we're going to go over our row allotted count by 45,000 credits approximately. And so that will pull from standard.
Tyler C: Yeah. So, and where, do you guys, can you guys maybe pull up your instance where you take a look at a few things just to make sure I don't have the contract in front of me and sometimes it comes through a little weird. So I just like to look at it in the instance itself. If that's OK. Yeah, absolutely. I want to make sure I'm giving you the right stuff. Yeah.
Veronica G: Let me share my screen. So here's the new data set that you gave us.
Tyler C: OK, perfect. OK. So let's do this real quick. Can we go to the admin section? Yes? And then, yeah, go more admin and then let's go to the credit utilization section on the right hand side under company settings… and then the subscription tab in the middle for me there. OK. So a couple of things here that I wanted to make sure we understood here. So here we can see monthly you do get 17,000 credits worth of materialized rows, right? And that's per month that you would get those. And so a credit for materialized equals a 1,000,000 rows. And so 17,000, right? Times, I don't know a 1,000,000 is g",Consumption Pricing Model,178263.40000000002,Corporate,ZIFFDAVIS.COM,6,Media,4400,>=$1B,Renewal,Blank,2: Determine Needs,Neil McGoldrick,2026-11-30,2024-10-31,,,,,,,0015000000xA9LEAA0

Ankit S: Good. How was your long weekend?
Justin L: Oh, it was great. Can't ever complain about a long weekend like that?
Ankit S: I know. I feel like it was well needed for everybody.
Justin L: Yeah, we had really good weather here in Utah too. So it was awesome.
Ankit S: Nice. Yeah. Can't wait until September this year has been so… quick?
Justin L: Yeah.
Ankit S: Hey, were you?
Justin L: On the call with 20 first century the other day, yesterday, when was that?
Ankit S: I did not, no, I could not make it, but then, was… I didn't have a chance to review the call, but… I do know those calls are now just reduced in time. A lot. Bellamy just wanted to meet like 15 minutes here and there through the week.
Justin L: Yeah, I know we wanted to kind of have a call to discuss kind… of future credit needs because they, you know, figure out their renewal.
Ankit S: So, yeah, yeah, Ben, maybe Ben can provide a little insight before we begin here. Hey, Ben.
Benjamin P: Yes.
Justin L: Hey, hey.
Ankit S: Justin was just asking about 20 first and just… having that discussion with them for the renewal and helping out credits.
Justin L: Oh, okay. Yeah. Ben, were we gonna do we need to like set a separate call up with him to kind of, I know we're gonna try and like scope out or just give it, get an idea of what future credit needs would be?
Ankit S: Yeah.
Benjamin P: Yeah, we probably need to set something up to focus on that.
Justin L: We have a, I think there's a quick call with him tomorrow. Is there any, I know that's just kind of a check in, can we maybe tackle it on that call? You think? Or?
Benjamin P: Is that the 15 minute call?
Justin L: Yeah, yeah.
Benjamin P: Yeah, it seems like we might need a little bit more time than that. I wonder do.
Justin L: You guys have more time if I ask him if we can just make that call a little bit longer or?
Benjamin P: Is that tomorrow? Yeah, it is. Tomorrow, isn't it? Yeah, I'm free after that, that's actually my last meeting of the day, which is a bit unusual, but yeah, I've got time.
Ankit S: Why don't why don't I just extend it and then we can… adjust is 30 minutes good. Justin, would you like more?
Justin L: That's probably more up to Ben. Like I, obviously, it's you know, guesstimating credit needs are kind of challenging. So, yeah… if we're not talking about.
Benjamin P: Any, yeah. Let's just let's start with that. Let's just start with that and see how it goes.
Justin L: Yeah. Okay. If we're not, if we're not doing anything else on that call, then I think 30 minutes will be fine.
Benjamin P: Well, I meet with Bellamy just about every day. Anyway, I met, I've already met with him once today. Oh, just working on different things. So.
Ankit S: Will, how's it going?
Benjamin P: So, I know Greg's not gonna be here. Sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt you.
Ankit S: No worries. I just wanted to acknowledge, will, I know we were talking about another client, but any time you get to.
William W: Hang out with the colmack team is a good day.
Ankit S: Awesome. Well, then I'll.
Benjamin P: go for it. Greg declined. So, I know he won't be here. He's the one that we typically were working with up until now, Eric, hasn't been present. He's sort of given it to Greg to run with. And so, Eric did accept. But yeah, just, maybe we should just ping him and see if he's planning to actually attend this session.
Ankit S: Yep. I'm doing that right now.
William W: I know this is being recorded out of curiosity. Does this automatically get sent to the account?
Ankit S: What exactly do you mean by account? Like the, Salesforce?
Justin L: Account?
William W: Yeah, like on kit after this to get this recording over to them, you have to like manually push that over to them, right? It's not gonna auto send or anything.

They also touched on upcoming product updates, swag options, and a potential business opportunity with a $1 billion revenue potential that could benefit from Domo's capabilities.","Phil S: hey.
Jason J: Just us.
Phil S: Just us.
Jason J: I ran into KP yesterday though and brought up some stuff about Domo and he had some questions about it. Is anybody using it in a supply chain besides us?
Phil S: I don't think so. The,
Jason J: biggest other people are product engineering. And then we're close with people management maybe is that.
Phil S: Well, people has kind of fallen off a little bit. It's seeming like that merchandising, and then a lot of groups like within product engineering are talking about it that's probably where they're doing like some AI agent, you know, proof of concepts side of there. But yeah, I'd love to talk to KP again.
Jason J: Well, he wants to talk to me first. I mean, he brought up stuff with that and it was like, I just wanted to make sure I had my ducks in a row of like, okay, who's actually, is, that was one particular thing he asked is like, is anybody else in supply chain using it? And he wanted some stuff about the like enterprise contract which I have all that. And then what's something else? I don't remember what, but it was more that I had the answer anyway. So I'll talk with him and see where his mind's at and, you know.
Phil S: Yeah, we need to do some more things because we got and we have hours to do it. So, especially if it's all like supply chain, let me look at like… what the rate there, because I think last time I checked, you guys are at like just 50 percent probably.
Jason J: But again, I'm starting more stuff and I mean, I'm going to rebuild a whole bunch of stuff once I get even just a read of cloudamp in. So.
Phil S: Yeah. And sometimes with cloudamp, I mean, it like reduces your overall credit consumption.
Jason J: That could be true, but I mean, it might not in this case because of like how I do it. Yeah.
Phil S: Because.
Jason J: It's more just getting compute down and not getting… smarter results back from gbq instead of just single SQL stuff like that.
Phil S: Yeah, yeah. But we've definitely got, and obviously, we just love to do it anyway, right? I'm sure there's value in like even if you end up using a little more credits or anything. But, yeah.
Jason J: Those are the stuff I'm not worried about. Again. I mean, I paid for the entire contract this month. I don't care. Oh, yeah.
Phil S: Well, Katie's going to care when like, hey, how many credits do you guys have? How many did you use? And then we're going to the thing I'll start the conversation with Dan too is we would want to get this to Domo's making a big push, you know, with Michael and I's teams on like multi years a big stress for the company as a whole, like strategic. And so that's one thing. And I think it would be better, you know, I think Dan would rather not do this like every year.
Jason J: Every year. Yeah, like.
Phil S: Let's do, you know, ideally like a three year deal and even if we hold steady with you guys and then increase the other new contracts we're working on. I mean, I think those would be a three year minimum anyway. I've always wondered like at what point at home depot, are we going to get to where like somebody in procurement kind of takes ownership of it from like a higher home depot procurement.
Jason J: Yeah. I mean that's again, I always thought that the analytics enablement team was the ones to do that, but they seem to just be saying, hey, this is an available tool out there. But beyond that, not much, yeah.
Phil S: It has to be like the procurement team that's responsible for like the Google relationship.
Jason J: I have no idea but.
Phil S: Anyway, that's my problem to deal with but I just, I would love to, yeah, let them know like if he's worried about funding or anything like especially getting started, like we've got a good amount of, we would, and we have been, you know, the hours like all the time.
Jason J: And I don't even think that, oh, that was the other thing and he wanted to know the conversation about usage over tableau and stuff, but I've got plenty of stuff I can tell you over that because it's like we're not replacing tableau with it exactly. But that's where I'm going to bring up the people management looking at it because, hey, they were going with it because of the cost structure because you don't have to have, you can get this data into everybody's hands without them having tableau licenses.
Phil S: Yeah. And the other big one to tell them on tableau that I've heard recently from the AI teams, is that tableau desktop is not, I mean, everyone at tableau is pushing people to their, you know, cloud based version and home depot is still on desktop, which means that like all their latest features of everything, like they don't have it and Salesforce owns.
Jason J: Yeah.
Phil S: Like agent force and right? Like home depot's not going to deal with those models. They're going to be more gym. So like some of that, of being like an agnostic provider like we are where you can pick bring your own model. I'm sure you can maybe in future versions of tableau, but you're always going to have, that conflict, right? Of like them being very heavily competitive with bigquery. So something to keep in mind and it can all draw down. Yeah.
Jason J: And again, I mean, I like, I've been hopeful with your conversations with that internal Google team and stuff like that, and switching, I mean, the more that it moves towards Google, I think the, it's only better. Yeah, it can only get better.
Phil S: I've hit a wall there to be perfectly honest, but, I think where it'll progress at least what, so now Domo's hiring like a whole team of people to just work with Google.
Jason J: Okay. Have.
Phil S: Like a over, they did it already for snowflake, and for databricks. The next one that they're hiring out is with Google to where like they're hiring former Google people and like working, you know, direct with that team. So they're building the relationship. And I think what they're telling me the former googlers are that once we get them like product engineering is looking at a big deal. It's like close to 700 K. Okay for what they're doing and Google, I don't know maybe they'll pay attention to us like when we're like, hey, l",Consumption Pricing Model,338173.18,Enterprise,HOMEDEPOT.COM,3,Retail,475000,>=$1B,New Logo,Sales,3: Demonstrate Value,Phil Stewart,2026-04-17,2025-07-01,2025-07-01,2025-08-08,,,,,0015000000YrkyqAAB

How's it going?
Scott T: Hey, Jesse. I'm good. How are you?
Jesse P: I am doing well. It's just coming off of a nice long weekend and trying to get back in gear for the week. Yeah.
Scott T: Me too. Apparently, There's some issues going on in the Domo world today. I guess Jenna just got a call from her school nurse that there's an emergency with one of her daughters, so she is maybe gonna miss the whole call. And then Ivan is also unable to join. So, you just get me right now?
Jesse P: Well, Tom is out currently on his vacation and Liam is out sick today. So it's currently just me over here on the greenway side. I think the only thing that we were going to do today was kind of discuss app studio stuff, but I didn't get the training information from Jenna until earlier this morning. So I haven't had time to review it at all. I don't want to like, oh, hi, Ivan. I don't want to like keep you here. If we don't really have the full plan that's what I.
Scott T: was going to ask is, can we?
Jesse P: Find a time later in the week? Yeah, that would be fine.
Ivan S: No worries. We'll just meet next Tuesday at our usual time.
Scott T: Do we want to push it a whole week or do you want to try to get together later this week?
Jesse P: Tom is out for the entirety of the week. Liam should be back in. Though. And the original goal that we discussed last week was that we were just going to go over the basics of appstudio, convert one of our pages that we have into as like an example, like go through as like a live workshop process. So we can either do it like on Thursday sometime if there's a time that works for everybody or we can scoot it over to next week and then Tom can join as well. Like I don't think that's going to be a problem either way.
Scott T: Okay. Yeah. I'm free Ivan, Thursday morning anytime from like eight 30 central to.
Jesse P: Oh, hey, Liam. I didn't think you were going to be in today.
Liam M: Sorry, I'm late.
Jesse P: No, you're good. I was just saying that you were out of office on teams, so I didn't think and we were going to reschedule because there was a little emergency on jenison. So we wanted to.
Liam M: Make sure.
Jesse P: that and she got us the materials earlier today. What does your Thursday morning look like Liam?
Liam M: Thursday morning's not great for me. I guess if it's after, if it's yeah, actually morning's not good for me after 11 works, but it's kind of not.
Jesse P: Really morning anymore. Yeah, it's getting close to that. We.
Ivan S: Could meet for 30 minutes on Thursday at, and you're in eastern, right? Time zone, correct, we can meet for 30 minutes at 12 on Thursday.
Liam M: I.
Jesse P: don't think it'll take us very long to go through an example transformation in dapp studio either. I think once we had a chance to look through the process and kind of review the studies, we can ask any questions we have there. And I sent over one to Jenna that I thought would be a good example for us to look through and I'll go ahead and send it to you as well, Scott.
Scott T: Okay.
Jesse P: But it's called app studio forethought deflection dashboard. It's basically a dashboard that we just made last week for a new project area. It's a super simple thing. It'll be really nice. This one's going to have a lot of eyes on it coming on. So, if it's something that we could go ahead and learn how to and like get into a nice little view, this is the one that I just sent you as a copy of it. I just duplicated it. So that way the real board is something that we'll change later on. So, okay. But yeah, that would be a good one to go through. I already sent it to Jenna, so she'll have access to it once she gets access to her computer. So, okay.
Scott T: Yeah. And then one of the other kind of fun thing with app studio, I don't know if you guys have like a brand marketing like a marketing brand kit or something, but,
Jesse P: if you have something send us, we do, we don't get to use. Oh, yeah, let's see, because.
Scott T: Then we could load in, we could load in those colors into your brand kit. And that way when we're building the app studio app, it's kind of branded to your colors already.
Jesse P: I'm going to be really honest with you. I hate our colors and I think most people hate our colors once they see them we, because we have this very bright neon green and this very bright neon blue. And like when you're looking at it like on a computer screen and it's like the background or something like that. It's really hard on the eyes. Okay? So we try to use our own.
Scott T: Brand kit.
Jesse P: Yeah, we actually the business intelligence or at least I do, I can't speak directly for Liam, but I'm sure Liam might agree with me but I try to stick to one of the nice like softer blues or in the background.
Scott T: Blues and greens, but not the blue and the green.
Jesse P: Not the, yeah, not the blue and not the green because, it is hard on the eyes if you look at it for more than five minutes. So, okay. Yeah.
Scott T: All right. Fair enough. Then nevermind about the brand kit, but, yeah, I think.
Jesse P: Yeah, we have explored the brand kit option before. That is something that I have like personally like given it a shot. And I was like, I would hate this if I had to look at this all the time. So, yeah, that's when we made the decision not to do that a long time ago.
Scott T: Sure.
Jesse P: Okay. So Thursday at 12?

Justin L: Yeah, I can't I've always had a hard time with the broncos. I actually don't mind them now, one of our good friends plays on their offensive line, but I'm still not a broncos fan there's. A ton of broncos fans in Utah.
Benjamin P: Yeah. Well, I'm looking forward to that. We went my first, it wasn't my first colts game because I've been to several colts games in Jacksonville, but my first colts game I went to in Indianapolis was three yeah, three years ago, and they were, it was the home opener and they were playing the chiefs and they actually won that game and they won it right at the end of the game. The chiefs were going down to try to score to win the game and Patrick mahomes threw an interception and the place just erupted and they just went nuts. I mean, anytime you beat the chiefs, it's an exciting day, so.
Justin L: Yeah.
Benjamin P: The stadium just went. It was a great game for my first game in Indianapolis. It was definitely a great one to go to. The year before last, we went to Indianapolis and they were playing the jaguars and for some reason, the jaguars are our kryptonite we can never beat them. I don't know why… but we're going back this year. My parents are coming. My dad's a broncos fan actually believe it or not, and he's never seen them play in person. And so it'll be sort of a father son rivalry.
Justin L: That's fun man. That's great NFL. I've only been to a couple but they're pretty cool.
Benjamin P: Oh, yeah. Indianapolis is just Lucas oil stadium, is amazing. It's just, it's a really good stadium.
Ankit S: That's an indoor stadium, right?
Benjamin P: Yeah, they have a retractable roof.
Ankit S: Cool. I've only ever been to one football game or NFL game at least and I'm… a dolphins fan. I'm not super into sports as of late. But when I was younger, I was a pretty big fan and they came up to play the jets in jersey… as I'm sure you guys know the giants and the jets actually technically play in jersey and not New York and I got to see them win. It was fun. The dolphins, the jets fans are salty.
Benjamin P: You said the dolphins?
Ankit S: Yeah, that's been my team since I was a kid.
Benjamin P: That's actually who we're playing this week, the dolphins? Oh.
Ankit S: Cool. Man. Yeah, I couldn't tell you anything about them now. I definitely fell off.
Benjamin P: Yeah. I was actually texting Bellamy last night because he's in Philadelphia. He moved to Philadelphia last weekend. Yeah, that's right? The eagles were playing last night. So I texted him. I said you should have went to the eagles game. He said, I know, and then he sent me a picture of him and his partner wearing their eagles jerseys. So they must have been watching it.
Ankit S: Nice.
Benjamin P: There he is.
Bellamy Y: Sorry about that. My meetings continuously get pushed out late.
Benjamin P: Oh, man. You're really repping the eagles?
Ankit S: Yeah, we were just talking about it.
Bellamy Y: So, my boyfriend came upstairs yesterday after they won and I was like, yep, it's time and I was like, what the fuck do you mean? And he's like it's time you remember, you talked about this and I was like, no, I don't but what are you trying to do? He just forcibly put that right behind me and said you're going to need to you're. Going to need this in your meetings. And now I have it and don't ask me about football please. I don't know anything.
Benjamin P: It was too late. It got delayed. So I ended up going to bed before it got over.
Bellamy Y: Yeah. The thunderstorm was like really brief yesterday here.
Ankit S: Yeah. How'd the move go Bellamy?
Bellamy Y: Oh, man. Not good. A lot of hiccups but we made it, we realized that we didn't insure the truck before we tried to cross country it. Oh boy. Thank God. Things were fine, but the truck already had like 150,000 Miles on it. And like the alignment was like 45 degrees off. So, crossing the country in that crap was really scary. Got here late and sent Sunday night literally unpacked the entire truck in a matter of two hours because the street is so goddamn tiny. Our truck is blocking the entire thing. So we had to walk around the neighborhood, try to find the fucking orange cone that's been thrown out on the sidewalk and block the entrance so that people can't come in here and give us the Philly rage, unload all that, return, the truck, come back and realize that our lower unit that we purchased doesn't fit our couch, which we were going to live in the lower unit. So then we… reroute and move everything upstairs. Again.

Hey, how are you?
Scott B: Doing great. Good, good. How are you doing?
Greg D: Doing good.
Scott B: Good. Is Ashley going to join us? Yeah. Hey, is it kind of echoey in here? Can you hear an echo when I talk?
Greg D: Not really.
Scott B: I moved into my basement. So we have like hard floors and it sounds super echoey to me but glad to know that it's not.
Greg D: No, it's good.
Scott B: Okay, cool. Thank you. Did I attach the service order to the email? I don't know if you had a chance to review it yet.
Greg D: Yeah.
Scott B: Hopefully, no surprises on there?
Greg D: Yep. No surprises. I do have one question on it, but it's more of a request versus an ask.
Scott B: Okay.
Greg D: We still have 18 hours left on the project hours that we've purchased this year that are good for January. Okay. Can we just apply that balance to the 4,500 that's owed to get us through April 20 third, 20 26.
Scott B: We can't and it's different kinds of Domo calculates the revenue differently, recurring versus non recurring. Oh, we don't have the ability. I don't have the ability to swap that over. Do you not have a use case for those hours?
Greg D: Not right now. No, Ashley's become so efficient, good that, any new reports needed to be built, she can handle. I don't necessarily need extra support. So we've been able to get through a lot of that. So, we have literally 18 hours that are going to expire that don't have a use for?
Scott B: Can we like use it to build an AI use case or something like that, something that maybe Ashley's not using doing yet workflows, something like that?
Greg D: Potentially.
Ashley C: When do they expire?
Greg D: January 30 first? I think.
Ashley C: Yeah, we were holding off on the AI stuff because it's just more credits.
Scott B: Yeah.
Greg D: I was hoping there was some way we could just call it flush and then, yeah.
Scott B: Apply the balance.
Greg D: It's a lot easier to then say, okay, we're going to extend even further. Not that this is not a fair agreement it is. I'm just saying like I can go to her and be like, hey, we got to extend there's. Nothing due this year and we have credits overages that they're basically working with us on… but this is what it's going to be moving forward.
Scott B: I mean, I know I can ask but I know what the answer is going to be. They're going to tell me no. I know for a fact, I've tried that before and haven't been able to get it. I hate that you have 18 hours that are going to expire. Yeah, 18 hours, you remember what you paid for it? 275 an hour.
Greg D: Probably it literally would come to 4,500. Yeah, even if it was 250, I think that comes to 4,500 dollars. And then for 23 bucks, I mean, we'll pay you 23.
Scott B: Bucks. Yeah. I mean, I can ask but the answer is going to be no, I can tell you right now. They'll tell me no, but I'll try anyway.
Greg D: Okay. Yeah. Let me know on that, but for the most part, this makes sense.
Scott B: Can I explain a couple of things? Yeah. So I added 20,000 bonus credits here and the intention of that, and then everything's the same. So, you know, just like we talked about, there's no changes. This gets the price down to a dollar 25 instead of the dollar 75 that you guys were paying for. And the reason why I did 20,000, let me share this one… because I'm looking at this. So, you know, we're going to probably finish out the month somewhere around like 27, 50, 2,800. Yeah. And looking at this, we've got essentially seven months left. So I rounded it up to maybe you do like 3,200 in a couple of months. And so this agreement would get you in total like 23,000 credits through the remainder of the year. Okay. So, and then it restarts and then you've got that full 40,000 for the remainder, you know, obviously for the remainder of the contract every year, 40,000. Yep. So that's how I got that number. It was a little rich compared to usually we'll only do 10 percent of the total agreement in courtesy credits, but, you know, it made sense. So I fought for it and I was able to get that approved.
Greg D: Yeah, no. And I appreciate you getting that done and rolled out and approved. So.
Scott B: Yeah, yeah. So let me go and just, I'll send an email to Sione?
Greg D: Yeah, because we literally could, but to that point, like to Ashley's point, we literally have no use for it. We've been able to become so self sustainable with all the training and onboarding and support that we've had and that we're not going to build anything else to garner more credits while we're trying to go through this because there's a potential we could exceed that. And then we're in another overage situation.
Scott B: Yeah.
Greg D: So, there's literally no use for it. I don't want to just say like here, go build a report that Ashley can do quick and easy. And then it takes two days to sit down and talk about here's what we need and all this back and forth stuff.
Scott B: Yeah, I get that. I'll talk to Sione, okay? If there's anything I can.
Greg D: Do to help. I don't mind hopping on a call too and begging and pleading.
Scott B: Yeah. I don't know that it would change anything. It's just what I would probably prefer to do instead if we're… worried about credit consumption with using these hours. I'd prefer to go and ask for more courtesy credits this year like so that you have a way to go and actually use those hours on something that you're not worried about, that would probably get passed but swapping over the revenue wouldn't I just don't think it would. Okay. So, but let me talk to them. Okay?
Greg D: Let me know.
Scott B: Okay. And then who's the signer on this?
Greg D: It will be Holly, but don't send it to her until I've had a chance to talk with her. So do.
Scott B: your.
Greg D: thing first. And then I have to talk to her and then go.
Scott B: For it, there's a couple of things to point out that I don't want to get too worried about. So there is, this has a start date of September first. I did that intentionally. So they don't send you an invoice for the overage. And there's an expiration date of August thirtieth, the last day of August. It's okay if it's signed afterwards.

Scott B: Okay. Let me show you this file sets thing first because it's I don't know that it necessarily pertains to this conversation but it's kind of cool. So I'll get this turned on if you want it. But essentially in here, you can just look for file sets and then you remember how we had the ability to like we were talking about like the whole invoicing thing which I want to talk about here for a minute. But the, essentially what we've added now is a folder structure for files. So if you upload a file, whether it be through like a folder connection, so like if you wanted to, like we talked about what's his name, Joe, is it Joe?
David K: Yep.
Scott B: We have the ability to connect directly to sheets and pull in files from sheets like those PDFS or those invoices, and then every time that runs, it'll ingest it into this new file set. So you create a folder. And then as it updates, you'll see you actually have the file here. And then the, you know, from this, we can do a couple of things. We can either, you know, run a job to extract anything from it that we want to. But what's really interesting is the ability to enable, oh, they… took it off because it's in beta. There's a little button right here. There used to be a button right here. This is enable for AI. I can't remember exactly what it was titled, but essentially, you can use it for chat. So within AI chat, you can ask questions and it will actually look at your files to use it to start building your repository.

Signe P: Good. How are you?
Maki: Good. Thank you. I really apologize for last week or last time. So, sorry about that.
Signe P: Nope. You're good. We're here. Thank you. Yeah. So I know matt has limited time, so he's going to just jump right into it. He set up the new quick start and then we can talk through the credit calculator. Is that okay? Okay. Yeah, that's fine.
Maki: All good, perfect.
Signe P: All right, matt, Matty, matt… it looks like he sent the link.
Matt T: That's the consumption calculator.
Signe P: Oh, got it. Okay. Go ahead.
Matt T: Gosh. Hold on one second. So, I made sure that your dashboard's all up to date. I gave you access to it for consumption so you can see it. You can keep track of your seven day trends, your trends over the last couple of months. How you're trending from a credit standpoint, what you were looking for from a low hanging fruit is basically these things that are running 10… or 20 times a day here's. The ones you want to focus on. So, what I did is I built you a filter up here called high run ETL datasets. If you Qlik on those, it will come down and it'll give you a punch list of all the things that you're running a whole bunch of times a day to figure out. Do you really actually need all of those to be running every 15 minutes? Basically. So that's what this list is right here is just a big list of all the datasets that are getting powered that are getting powered by or… costing you a lot of credits. So that's how you'll use this portion to trim down if you're trying to get your number under where you guys need to be that'll be the best way is to use that filter and use that. And then the consumption credit. Oh, sorry, one second here.
Maki: So, while you're working on that, the snowflake life connections, they're not costing anything in Domo?
Matt T: No, not, unless you store those in Domo. So if the data set is stored in Domo, then you'll have a charge for that. But if the data sets are not stored in Domo, then you won't have a cost associated with that. So, this is an S3 connector that is storing the data.
Maki: Okay.
Matt T: Storing the data in Domo with an append functionality here. So, any of those ones that you're seeing in there, those are credits that are costing you. If you guys are using snowflake to build cards, you're not gonna see any cost associated with that.
Maki: Okay. Thank you so much for setting this up. It's very useful.
Matt T: Real quick. Just so you know, how to use the consumption credit calculator too. So you can see what it costs you. So as you're working through those runs that you have, if I was to take one of those examples, I would just set this to manual. I think it's the easiest way to do it, you would come in here and say, hey, look right now, I'm running every 15 minutes. But what if I went to a daily run of a table? What would that look like? And if I transformed it, what would it look like over the course of the year? And in this case, it's just showing you what it is. If it runs, if it runs on the weekends versus not running on the weekends. So if that job didn't run on the weekends, it would be for you to take one table and then transform it. Running it once a day will bring it down to 522 credits as opposed to when you were here when… you were here and you were running one table every 15 minutes… on the weekends as well. It's costing you per table. It's costing you that many credits. Wow. So you can see the big difference that's what this calculator is built for is for you to be able to figure out like, you know, not only this, not only this functionality of how much it would save you if you did that, but also like, hey, I got a customer. I got somebody in the business that's coming to me and they say, look, I want this to run every hour and let's just say you don't even have to transform it. Who cares? It's just you're bringing in that data from Aws and it's coming in every day, once an hour. If it's coming in, this has the caps in place. So just so that, you know, this has the user caps that are underneath your underneath… the sorry, your supplemental terms here. I'll put those in the chat too just so that you have it.
Maki: Okay.
Matt T: So this has the caps put in place so that if you were to run it every hour in a day, you're only charged 10 credits per day. And so on.
Maki: Okay. This gives me a good picture. So I looked at everything and it looks like everything is coming from S3 Amazon S3. And if I, just to check my understanding, is this, the cost is like the running cost, the fact that it runs every 15 minutes is making it really high. And then also storing it is making it higher?
Matt T: I wouldn't say probably your storage is not making it high. So if I go and look at that one dashboard, let's just look at that one. Hopefully this one's a, that is an S3. So let's just look at this one particular, you're appending it. So every month, you pay nine credits for this, that's 9,000,000 rows, right? So, you're paying nine credits for that. So, I don't think the storage is probably your problem. It's just the fact that this is running every 15 minutes. So, because it's running every 15 minutes, you're paying 20 credits a day for this to run, right? And so does it really need to go? Let me see, you know, how frequently does it really need to run to do it? Like you added 15 rows, you added 15 rows in the last 15 minutes. You're adding about 15 rows a minute or every 15 minutes. Is that really worth it to the business for them to have, you know, a credit to run four credits right here? Or is it like, you know, what? We could wait for an hour to do it? I don't know you guys will know the answer to that is what are they using it for to try to figure out what that is? And then they at least can understand the cost of the business, right?

Brice W: What's up? How you doing?
Phil S: Doing good, man? How about yourself?
Brice W: Doing well. It's Monday?
Phil S: Yes. And I know you got a lot of things moving a lot on your plate. So, I appreciate your time.
Brice W: Yeah, we're keeping them all spinning, just kind of running around and touch them up a little bit.
Phil S: That feels like, yeah, what? I, yeah, do the same thing. I'm always like, oh, well, you just move this one a little forward, move that a little forward and then see.
Brice W: What happens? Oh, that one's wobbling, better start hitting that one pretty good.
Phil S: Oh, yeah. Well, yeah, I can, we don't have to take too much time, but I mainly wanted to sync because I know, you know, it's just, it's like a big giant project and all this stuff. I just wanted to kind of catch up and make sure we're all aligned on schedules and, you know, everything that I can do to help support. The first thing I wanted to do to get an update on is just like the PLM project itself. I know that was kind of the thing that's you were going to learn a lot more of like what's in trade beyond versus what's not like any updates there on the overall project?
Brice W: Not a whole lot like they're starting the user acceptance testing in some of the other modules. Nothing that's really has to do with us. Well, I'm sorry, they've established the groups that are going to be doing the testing when it's ready to do the testing with the module. So they're still planning on starting to roll the thing out in January. I think, yeah, we have not had a single meeting yet for our groups like the grouping and all that stuff, the testing side of it. So or I should say that back, we haven't started the groups with the main trade beyond group. They've asked us a bunch of questions. So I think by next month, I think they're going to start getting into some of the details with us. So all that to say it's still, they're still talking like January timeframe just for the flex part of it. For the testing part of it. I went back and watched one of their proposals and it made me think of something that I didn't talk about with your team too much, I don't think and maybe we did, I can't remember if we covered it or not. But it went back to the relationship between the test line and the protocol. Our lab is using a software now where if you write a test line and you add it to a protocol like a test, how you want to test this product today, when you add that test line to that protocol, that relationship between the test line and the protocol are broken. So you can go in and edit whatever you did. You basically just used it for a template.
Phil S: Yeah.
Brice W: So, what has happened with our lab is that it's… not useful at all because you grab that thing, you bring it in and everyone changes it, they just grab the one that was closest to whatever they needed and then go write all their own things in. So there is really no template in that system. You're basically making a new test line every time?
Phil S: Yeah.
Brice W: And so that's the one thing I think whenever we start thinking about that is like the test line database is going to be the source of truth and everything points back to it. If you build a protocol, you can't edit the acceptance criteria in the protocol. If you want to update anything in there, everything has to happen from the test line database. Because for one, we want to be able to track this stuff and be able to mine it and look at trends and things. The other thing is we want the SPS to be able to make a change to one test line and it changes 50 different protocols where if that connection gets broken, you still have to go into each one of those 50 protocols and update everything. Yeah. So that was one thing I don't know if we talked about it or not, but I just went back and watched the one thing from the one review we have with tradebeyond, and that's kind of what we got. But other than that, we haven't had too much conversation on the tradebeyond side. I think they're 100 percent focused on getting flex in there. So I don't know when we'll get to talk about our extra test management system.
Phil S: Yeah. And that's kind of what I mean internally, like as we're talking to people, you know, about the deal and stuff that's what… I'm sure the team is trying to understand is like, well, where, like where… are we… at? As far as like, all right, we know that Domo is going to like augment you know, what's being done or not. And then at what point, like is tradebeyond informed like, hey, we're also working with Domo to like augment this? And would it make sense to, you know, partner right? At that stage to where? Like, hey, if we're you know, going to be part of this, you know, overall solution? Like does it make sense for us to start talking with them now, right? You know, to kind of be in part of the design? That way they're not kind of doing double effort, but I also understand it from like Jose's perspective, your perspective on, well, you know, they're kind of, you know, competing solutions. And we also want to just, you know, maybe pursue both paths to see which one gets us there, you know, faster, right? But yeah, I don't know what are your thoughts there? Of kind of where home depot's at in that decision?
Brice W: Our thought, I think we're still in the quoting process for the job. So we're still, you know, working looking for all the solutions… and integrating with trabion and everything. Now. I personally… I think they're overwhelmed I think. And there's really not. They don't even have, I don't even think they have the tables to even show you. This is where the data would go right now for this for our work, our section. Okay. So like to ask them. Hey, we, yeah, that sounds great. And like, okay, well, do you have that? No, we don't have that or when we build it. Yeah, you can. So I wouldn't even think integrating with like say everything goes well, Domo gets, you know, we decide to move forward and all that stuff. I don't even think there'd be anything to show from the trabion side till December or January.

AJ C: How fun. Sounds like it. Neil notified us that he's going to be running a little late, so we'll just kind of go through the call, which is just kind of talking about the image to text feature that we have. Unless… there's anything else you guys want to talk about?
Dalton C: Yeah, I think we're.
Tyler C: still waiting on Andy from.
AJ C: Our side.
Tyler C: We're all here, Dalton. Oh, never mind. I can't see anything I thought you'd still be in Mexico?

Tyler C: Now, hair of the dog is what they say.
AJ C: Hair of the dog.
Andy D: It's a slippery slope though. Trust me.
AJ C: All righty. Well, Tyler, if you want to walk through that feature a little bit for him, then feel free to ask questions as we go. Everybody.
Tyler C: Yeah. Let's jump into that and talk a little bit about it. I'm assuming if you guys are curious about it, you have some concept or idea of how maybe you want to use it. Can you guys give me a little bit more information on what you're thinking so far? If not totally fine, just trying to get base. So, when we talk about it, we can maybe use it as an example?
Andy D: Yeah, I don't know. I think primarily, so, a lot of our resumes in Salesforce are stored as PDFS. So I think it would be looking through those PDFS and being able to aggregate or utilize information from the resumes. I think the end game solution would be to say, hey, we just got this requirement with these skill sets in the last six months. Here are the top candidates from our database that we've actually talked to go call for this.
Tyler C: Interesting. Okay. So when you're looking to do this, are you looking to store any of this data as well or more just review? I guess we would probably want to store some of the data so that it's easier to pull like, hey, here's the people that have met these requirements in the last six months, right? Yeah, I.
Andy D: think we don't know what we don't know honestly, Tyler. Yeah. So, no.
Tyler C: Worries. So let me show you a little bit of some of the options that we have for that. Let's see. Is this a good one? Let me double check. We find one that's actually using. Sorry, we have a whole bunch of different versions of them. Let me, I'll show my screen though. I think this one that Nolan set up is one that uses it. So it's all going to be done through workflows for the most part. And we can talk about how to get those files in there differently. But this is like a very simple example. But here we have like image to text in this section, right? So if I edit it, this is actually using a function within the dataset or within doma within code engine. And so you could also change this a little bit to make it a little bit easier for what you guys are doing. But if we're just using the base one, this is what is generating this. And then when we're actually using it, go back, you'll see over here. We just have to choose a few things, you know, directory path, the file set id, which is that's kind of coming soon because that's all with like the file sets and everything that we're coming out with. And so that's going to change how some of these things work. But it'll still work relatively the same way you'll choose like the model that you're using to, you know, of AI to go through and check the data, the path, and then the prompt so that's one option of how to do it is just to use the code engine function here, which if it's very specific, might be the way to go. If not then what we'd probably want to do is still leverage like the AI functionality, the AI agent. And as you can see here, we're making a lot of changes to make this a lot easier. I don't know if you guys have played around with this yet. But instead of going and directly doing that, you can give it a little bit more context, a little bit more information in here by doing it this way. And so like you can see, you can come in here and add some tools and say, hey, I actually want to add, you know, image to text inside of here, which would be, I think in code AI here… yeah, generate app code, let's see if we can find the other one though. So here's all of our AI service layer options. So we can say file set, image text, right? I can add that tool into here. And then depending on what else we wanted to do, maybe we wanted to store that data to a data set once we get it in there. Then I can say, okay, if I want to look up data set, and… then we have let's see, yeah, append to data set here, download data set update. I can add that tool into there, right? And then that gives me all the tools that the AI agent is going to need. And then in here, we can say, okay, I want you like the prompt and the instructions are fairly similar but used for slightly different reasons. So instructions are going to be like your overall like giving the AI agent base context, right?

Phil S: And while we're waiting on everybody to join Roger, did you happen to see, I know you were out, so you might have, you probably had a lot of emails, but there was one that said you just got domoed, it's like a trial instance that I had set up for you guys.
Roger C: You just got domoed. Is that?
Phil S: Yeah, it's like got an apostrophe if you, I think it would have come over from me. If not, if you don't see it, I can put the URL here.
Roger C: Yeah, I see that. Oh.
Phil S: Perfect. Yeah, it'll just have, you know, put in a password. I wanted to set this one up for you because I mean, you guys have, you have your own login right to the, you know, home depot product engineering, and you guys have the salvage one. But when you're experimenting with like AI agents, I don't want you to be worried about like, well, am I going to, you know, get charged money or anything like this? So, as we're like building anything out for proof of concept, wanted you to not be worried about that. So, I've actually got several, I mean, they're all, like home depot's merchandising is doing some trial things in there as well. So it's just kind of a general azure hosted environment where you guys can use as a sandbox. And I think matt should be joining, but we've also got colt on here, colt sellers, Roger, you probably haven't met colt before, but he's on our, proof of concept team, and specifically, has done a lot of really cool projects, around AI, and agents. So, I know that's really your primary area of interest. So, colt, I'll let you say hi and introduce yourself.
Colt S: Yeah, Roger. It's good to meet you. As Phil said, I've been with Noma for about three years. I was a customer for five before that, so, I've been around the platform for a long time. But yeah, luckily, I think, I get kind of stuck in some pretty interesting AI use cases nowadays. So, it's, always interesting to hear what people have and we're doing some pretty cool things with the platform so excited to dive in.
Phil S: Yeah, and Roger, I'll kind of recap because I know it's been a few weeks since we last talked to you really, it seems like, you know, your area of interest, right? Is around AI agents and AI chat because you have tableau desktop. It's working really well. You know, for everything, bi, the area that we could potentially add value. And as we're going through this as well, I will want to help you with, well, if I did build an agent even if it's good, what does it cost? Because we, you know, need to be able to forecast that out for you as well. So that's yeah, what we can help you accomplish today. And, my thought is we can just do it in that trial account. You know, that you've got access to, and kind of build alongside you, but I was wondering maybe to start, is there any use case you've got in mind or like a particular project you've got right now that, hey, it'd be great to do this in parallel with what I'm doing right now or I'll let.
Roger C: You, yeah, this is a very fluid conversation. Honestly, when I talk to you guys, what a month ago versus today, there's a lot of conversation internally about AI agent at home depot. You know, is this something that we should outsource to other companies? Or is this something we should develop internally? You know, we were, you know, it was time of SVP. We actually, had a pitch of, having another company to help us come set up the AI agents, initiative. But now, this all changed in the last few weeks that home depot decided that we want to do this in house, you know, home depot, it has developed a framework that allow different teams to do their own AI agent. I'm, still interested to see what your, platform is able to offer. So, I do have a use case that I want to test. I actually just logged into your, trial account. I'm not sure how to start. So, maybe if you can give me some idea of like, you know, what, where do I go from here? That would be great.
Phil S: Yeah, yeah, absolutely. And then maybe it would help us to know what use case do you have in mind, and that way we can answer that objective and sure do that same thing? Yeah.
Roger C: We have some pretty, structured data around star rating, right? So, I think one of the use case we have is we want to have individual agent that are kind of expert for different metrics. So that one of the metrics that we were thinking to test or to begin with would be star rating, right? We have a lot of very structured data that tells us what's the star rating for different product vendors, different levels of cat, hierarchy, right? So we, one of the challenge we have today is that, you know, we want to understand what's moving the needle, what's the opportunity moving forward, right? So those are the two main questions that the team is spending a lot of time to manually analyze today, right? So, if, for example, there's often questions coming from Jose's level to say, hey, you know, we're seeing a point one star improvement in this class, what is driving this improvement, right? So, if you can, you know, do a waterfall breakdown, what's the subclass, what's the SKU? What's the vendor that is moving that needle? You know, that's the number one question. Number two question is, hey, this category really sucks three point five star. What's the opportunity moving forward? Which SKU, which vendor should we be focusing on? That will give us the biggest bang for the buck, right? So we're leaving for our associates to interpret that today because they have to go through the data to say, well, it's a lot of analysis, right? You know, we've seen some examples where the associates thinking it's this category. But once we put all the data facts together, it's not this, it's another category, right? So, this is where we want to leverage AI agent to help us answer those questions. Like I said, we have very structured data, you know, pretty much everything is calculated but it's just that visualizing… and presenting that data at differe",Consumption Pricing Model,338173.18,Enterprise,HOMEDEPOT.COM,3,Retail,475000,>=$1B,New Logo,Sales,3: Demonstrate Value,Phil Stewart,2026-04-17,2025-07-01,2025-07-01,2025-08-08,,,,,0015000000YrkyqAAB

So it is just me today and there was just we're putting the final touches on the full adoption value, roadmap proposal and presentation to share with the team.

Joyce J: I don't think so. I mean, on my end?
Keaton M: All right. Well, let's.
Jenna H: go. So… you have a lot of pages and content and things in your Domo instance right now and a few areas. I was wondering if there was any type of reporting that currently exists on or anything that happens in Domo that helps track these initiatives. If you knew where they might be. That would be great. And the first one I was wondering about was, do you know if there is anything in Domo that talks about like measuring almost… like product mix reporting? Like the different types of products you have… when you introduce a new product? Like, I know there's the griddle with the air fryer combo. Is there anything in Domo that helps track that specific element of if a new type of griddle or a new type of product is doing better versus the others? Do you use that to make decisions on if to keep it or to maybe discontinue it, things like that?
Keaton M: No, that's actually something that we're looking at because usually for that, we like to use our point of sale data because we get real time information for that. And right now that's pretty scattered a lot of excel reporting there. So that is something that we… for sure can do better on. And for your first question where we're tracking, I think you said tracking dashboard engagement. Is that where you're kind of getting at with the first question or?
Jenna H: No, it's so just looking at what blackstone does, how you use your demo instance, you know, there's data everywhere and Dave's kind of walked me through some of the pages and how he goes from one page to the other to another one to kind of like connect some dots. And for myself, I was just before I tried going through all your pages and answering these questions, I just didn't know if you knew off the top of your head if things like that existed. So it sounds like right now there is nothing currently on like product mix performance.
Keaton M: Just like, yeah… we have like a few, so… unit shipped, for example, we'll we will track, I think we have, we'll track like cooking unit sales versus accessory sales, kind of stuff like that. We… and then we have. And then like same with, And we have that a few other places I think.
Jenna H: Okay.
Keaton M: But yeah, that's something we could for sure. Yeah, like all sales orders, for example, we'll track like… griddles, accessories like the different, our different product groups, and that will include like the new like pizza ovens, for example, is like a, or smoking two different ones that, we can track that way. But… I think there is definitely room for improvement there.
Jenna H: Okay. Do you know how often the… company kind of goes and looks and thinks like evaluates all the products in the product mix and decides what to keep and maybe what to discontinue and what to like increase a focus on?
Keaton M: Yeah, I mean, I think Joyce could answer that pretty well, but I think that it's definitely an ongoing thing usually when it's oftentimes like when we gotta buy more, right? If that's if there's certain products that we know aren't performing well. We just won't buy anymore. So it's… a continuous thing. We have a few reports that help with that. But yeah.
Jenna H: Great. My next one was in terms of measuring both major… retailer performance as well as like the international market performance. And I know on some of the pages you can filter to like the retailers. Is there one that is there like a walmart report or an Amazon report or something along those lines?
Keaton M: Yeah, usually it's a lot of filtering. We like to build like one dashboard and reuse it, right? But like for example, on POS data, there's an Amazon report and that's specifically because we were able to get Amazon data into Domo the quickest and earliest. So that was built out for Amazon in particular. But now that we're starting to get more and more POS data that's something that we're working on building out for like other customers as well. Trying to get like more of the specific retailer information there. I guess, that's a good question on whether we want to like build out specific, build it out more specific for different retailers or if we want to build a maybe it's maybe the answer is both on this but like build an overall for you and then a filter to drill down.
Jenna H: Some things that like I've seen in other retail clients that I've worked with is there'll be a sales page essentially, and it may just compare the sales of all the different retailers against each other without the, so it's kind of like a more of a summary view, but looking at like trends of retailers, units purchased, and things like that. And so, I didn't know if anything like that existed or if there were specific because some of them have different. I've seen instances where different retailers had different metrics or things like that they kind of report out on. So.
Keaton M: Yeah, that's that is the case. I think. So we definitely have some retailers report different things in different ways. So, a lot of that right now is handled by ad hoc reporting. So, yeah, we could totally look at a getting that into Domo and getting that into a better look. Yeah. With our, with our merger, we've had to like build out specific reports that weber looks at more and through that. We, I've built out a few reports that kind of compare… retailers, I guess.

The primary issue was that Marcus lacked the necessary Facebook Business Manager permissions to connect the Facebook Ads Advanced connector in Domo, requiring Scott from IT to grant him the appropriate access. Once Marcus has the correct permissions, the Domo connection can be re-tested, and the team will schedule another working session to continue the integration.

Marcus S: Hello?
Valeria A: Hello?
Jenna H: All right. I don't know if Ankit's going to be joining today, but we could probably get started.
Brian F: Yeah. There was a message somewhere saying that he was not going to make it today or… he was going to be, what was that double booked? Yeah. So, yeah, he's not going to make it today.
Valeria A: Cool.
Brian F: All right, sergeant, are you in now? Do you want me in now? You want Charles? What do you want? What's the… sorry, I think.
Jenna H: It's to continue getting things connected in the product and I haven't done that yet. So.
Charles H: Yeah. Oh, I may have jumped the gun. I'll share my screen.
Brian F: Oh.
Charles H: All right. So we're… still kind of just, we've pushed the data connections in the product into your instance. There's still a bit of cleanup on our side because you guys don't have all the modules. We kind of just have to sort of do a little bit of manual cleanup, but you should have paid social and web connected. And this is powered by your data. We can potentially probably at our next touch point, we might be able in a position to kind of actually go through and look at the data and see kind of if it makes sense?
Valeria A: Yeah, that would be great.
Charles H: But I think this is kind of where we are at.
Jenna H: So, we have live marketing… reporting happening? Is that an accurate statement Charles?
Charles H: Technically, yes. Yeah, I haven't set up any of that. The connections aren't fully running yet, but they are like, it's just a matter of turning on the automation.
Jenna H: This is super exciting.
Valeria A: Is this for LinkedIn? Is this for which platform?
Charles H: This is for LinkedIn, just curious, LinkedIn and meta.
Valeria A: Oh, so it's combined? Yeah.
Charles H: We do have to probably add in a filter for the platform?
Valeria A: Yeah, yeah. Yeah, that'll be helpful.
Charles H: So, you can differentiate between the two? Yes, that would be great. That would be great. I guess Brian, that's probably something we don't really have. Okay. So, here we go LinkedIn. Okay. Oh.
Valeria A: Gotcha. Platform performance? Okay?
Charles H: Yeah, it should show LinkedIn and meta. I have to see why that's not happening. But.
Valeria A: Thank you.
Marcus S: So,
Brian F: wait, do we get the connection to Facebook set up? I thought that's what we were working on today. I'm sorry.
Charles H: Oh, I guess probably, I do apologize. I think that was the other piece that we were trying to do is set up the second connection to Facebook in case Valeria, if anything happens to her, we have Marcus to quickly pivot the connection to. So, I do apologize. I was sidetracked… and what I'd set up. No worries. I guess Marcus, are you able to share your screen?
Marcus S: Yes, I am. What am I sharing?
Charles H: Do you want to log into Domo?
Marcus S: Oh, yeah. Hold on a second. Let me see Domo?
Brian F: All right.
Marcus S: Okay. All right.
Charles H: So, Qlik on the data… there. Yep, and then hit connect. Connectors… Facebook ads advanced is what you want to search for?
Marcus S: The advanced, yeah.
Charles H: Just hit connect.
Marcus S: Now, I just have to figure out what device that's going to send to. I haven't gotten any notifications yet. So, I'm not sure which one it's going to come to.
Valeria A: Marcus, try going to the Facebook app on that particular device. And then I think it'll open up that's what happened to me?
Marcus S: Okay. All right. Well, now, it's like I have to log in and I generally don't use the Facebook app. I think that's what Valeria is for Valeria does all the Facebook stuff. So, I haven't logged in a long time. So, it's asking me a 1,000,000 questions to reactivate. My account. I feel bad wasting those times, no.
Charles H: Stress.
Marcus S: let's see. Okay. There it is. All right. All right. So, now, check notifications. Still there? I'm not getting any notifications from Domo.
Charles H: No wonder. You Qlik that, try another way. There you go.
Marcus S: Trust this device. I think.
Charles H: Choose the opt in to all in current and future.

Charles H: Okay. So, nothing came through.
Marcus S: Right. Looks like it.
Charles H: I think… Valeria… you'll need to share the account then with Marcus, it's kind of strange. I thought we saw that he had it.
Valeria A: Oh, I see like in Domo, you mean?
Charles H: No, in Facebook business manager, because when he pulls data, nothing's coming through, That's weird. So, I don't think he's in business manager. I don't think he's associated.
Valeria A: Okay. Let's see. Let me see here. Linked accounts. Oh… sorry. Do you know off the top of your head? How I would go about it in Facebook? I'm so sorry, I haven't done.
Charles H: This on Facebook? No, don't worry. I think you'll have to share your screen and I can talk you through.
Valeria A: It, yeah, no worries. Sorry, I'll just go back to home that way and kind of see.

Good morning.
Virginia C: Hello. How's it going?
Brian F: Good. How are you doing today?
Virginia C: Good. Thanks for your patience.
Brian F: You're two minutes late. It's fine.
Virginia C: Ah, well still?
Brian F: I understand. I'm the same way, but I get it.
Virginia C: How's it going since we last talked?
Brian F: You know, a lot of balls in the air, a lot of balls in the air, a lot of context switching today, but it's all good. Cool.
Virginia C: Okay. What do we need to make sure to cover?
Brian F: So, I think we're… I mean, after the whole discussion yesterday? What I'm thinking is we go to the, everyone social, I always can't decide if it's everybody or everyone social. And then I get in my own head. Yeah. And if we can export those reports and take a look at them, you… know, and then I can export… them. I'll import them. We can take a look at them and start building stuff out. I think also taking a look at going through the reports that are there now and… seeing what's there in actually in the like in everyone social.
Virginia C: In the system, okay? In.
Brian F: The system itself and seeing, you know, it sounds like you look at them somewhat, but it sounds like, you know, but you have people that look at them a lot more often. But even if it's just like, you know, let me take some screenshots and see… about reproducing them whether it's all of them, a handful of them. However, you know, we decided to do it, that's where I'm thinking we should start. How does that sound?
Virginia C: Yeah. Let's take a look. Let's share. That seems right. Let me know if you see everyone social.
Brian F: Yep.
Virginia C: Cool. So this is what they call the overview page. I think the metric we use from here is reach. So, as long as that's filterable, I would say by month. So like this month, last month, specific months being able to look at that, that's helpful. And then… we look… at, I'm pulling up my… report… or not my report, my presentation that I just kind of keep… updated on a monthly basis. So that if asked it's ready. But it's taking a minute to load. So… okay. What I report out is at a firm level and then at the executive level and I can show you how we excuse me get the executive level numbers. In the tool, but for both of those levels, I report out number of shares and the month over month, change, number… of people reached, and the month over month change the number of Qlik and the month over month change.
Brian F: And the shares and the Qlik, are they on everyone's social? Are they on everyone's social or are we talking about on LinkedIn?
Virginia C: So, everyone's social is think of it like a library and not only does the library push help you push out content. So if I'm Brian, I log into the north highland instance, I connect my LinkedIn, my Twitter, my Facebook, my Instagram to this tool. Everyone's social and I can peruse the library and schedule content from the library to post out on my channels.
Brian F: What.
Virginia C: then happens is everyone's social pulls metrics back from Brian's channels so… that Virginia can see the impact it's having for the brand. So, if you, Brian are connected to 20 people and Danielle is connected to 75, and Kaylin is connected to 300. It's going to aggregate… share, impressions, Qlik and other engagement based on who from Brian, Danielle and Kaylin's audiences interacted with the content and potentially saw it.
Brian F: Yeah. Okay. So.
Virginia C: That is stored in everyone's social. But as far as like… total number of Qlik your team's shares have received, if you hover over these, you can get some of the definitions. Obviously, you aren't logged into this. So I'm happy to hover and show whatever definitions you need. But did… that answer your question around it?
Brian F: Did I, was, I will, so where I was going and quickly realized that wasn't going to work was, could we just go to your corporate LinkedIn account and pull reach and shares and impressions and things from there. No, that's right very quickly. I was like, no, that's not going to work. So, sorry, I was trying to problem solve and go around but.
Virginia C: Okay. No, I appreciate the line of thinking. Unfortunately, this tool, this is a fun tool. It's super cool. And it definitely helps augment the brand in a unique way. But unfortunately, it is the only way to pull some of the information.
Brian F: Yeah, we got one. We use octopost.
Virginia C: Oh, okay.
Brian F: KT o P o ST, which sounds pretty much exactly the same same same.
Virginia C: Yeah. There's a couple of them out there. We just switched to this one. Okay? So it's unfamiliar for a lot of different reasons.
Brian F: Yeah.
Virginia C: Okay. So, yes, shares reach Qlik at the firm and executive level. I then also report out people who have zero shares specifically on the executive team for any given month.
Brian F: On and out. Huh?
Virginia C: Yeah, yep. And they do that on the executive team meeting. So, it's… a doozy slide. A little bit of shame goes a long way.
Brian F: Do you give them a heads up? Like?
Virginia C: Nope. Nobody gets a heads up.
Brian F: Fantastic.
Virginia C: It is, you know, if you're willing to risk being on that slide, all it takes is one share and you don't get put on that slide. And it's a scheduling tool. So, there really is no excuse that you didn't have time and there's an auto schedule feature. If you turn it on, the tool will just publish for you based on when your audience is online… that's we really try and make it easy.
Brian F: And, and yet.
Virginia C: And yet there's still probably 30 to 40 people on that list month over month. Yeah. So those are the metrics that I actively track with my team. And then as we're expanding, what I have been told the other teams look at is, group metrics and leaderboard metrics which are underpinned by user posts and shares, posts. I'm less concerned about. And I don't think anybody actually reports on this, I think they just are nosy, posts is who from the team has contributed content? And what was that content?
Brian F: Okay.

I didn't see your email in the invite, so maybe that's why I didn't have it hold up or not familiar, but excited to work with you more. And yeah, excited to have this adoption team really at your guys' disposal. And hopefully we can get some really great things going. Looks like Juliana just joined. So I will let her take it from you.
Juliana J: Hey, everyone. Sorry, I was late. It's good to, I think I don't think we've met Colin and Dave yet. So I don't know if we wanted to do quick introductions.
David B: Sure. I'm Dave, I'm currently a consultant for pharmacan with the analytics department. Been here what maybe a little over 11 years used to kind of lead our analytics department and then kind of step down to a part time role helping with budgeting and quite a few of the things with dumbo these days, so.
Colin T: Yeah, I can jump in there for a second. So I'm Colin Thomas worked like I said, underneath Dave for several years before he left the company towards the consulting side. Right now. I focus mainly on the cultivation data analytics. So, anything with the plant side of things kind of before it gets turned into any sort of hash edible or oil like that is my realm.
Juliana J: Awesome. Good to meet you both. We're happy to have you here and have you kind of helping us along with our roadmapping here. So, I'm Juliana, I'm the project manager here at dumbo, so I help move projects along and make sure everybody's aligned and things are moving forward. I'll pass it over to Brian.
Brian F: Hi, Brian Fentress here. I'm a principal business consultant more on the visualization side, you know, working with your business and making sure that we're telling the data story that you need.
Nik K: Nick, I'm a principal technical consultant at dumbo more focused on data ingestion, data transformation, and any custom apps or integrations with like cloud warehouses and platform.
Umair K: Hey, I'm Umair, on the services team here. I work closely with this team, just supporting on use case requirements, ultimately turning it into a proposal or a statement of work based on what you want to accomplish.
David B: Hey, all at inglon, I have the fortunate ability to work with Brian, Nick, Juliana and Umair, I'm in professional services, one of the leaders here. I'm really excited to get moving and here to help in any way I can.
Juliana J: Awesome. I think that was everyone. So we brought the whole squad today. So I know that was a lot of introductions but as we work together, we'll all get familiar with our roles, but yeah, I think so. Today's, call last time we met with Joe and we went over some ways that the adoption program here that we're working on can help you guys with Domo and with adoption and maybe with automating some processes and just aligning with your overall business goals at pharmacan. So with that being said, we do have like a solution roadmap or an adoption roadmap, apologies that we've started just kind of based off of our first conversation with Joe and we just want to have a collaborative conversation and see if there's any other ways we can help and bring those use cases forward and kind of talk about prioritization today. So with that being said.
David B: We're excited about it too by the way because we just, I don't know if Joe's giving me background but, you know, like most of our analytics team were cannabis, right? So our budget is small. We pulled most of us were trimming weed at one point and, you know, kind of moved into this part right from there. So we've kind of developed the skills as we went along a couple of years ago. They said, hey, we got this Domo thing we want you to use so everybody can see things in the stores and it's been a lot of self teaching but we're very much not a team with a ton of background in data science or anything like that. So what we've done was kind of like, all right, we had cannabis industry as a whole was built on spreadsheets. And then it evolved in the Domo and I'm happy to where we've gotten the last three years have been when we merged with pharmacan, a lot of adoption just to get everybody looking at live data and tracking and like that's there. But we've really wanted to kind of take the next step. We've done more of our sales forecasting and demand planning in Domo and it's working for us but it's far from perfect. So looking over kind of what you all have in there, we're pretty excited about the prospects of some of these things. I will say we're constantly in transition with being cannabis in the last couple months. We've had to do massive API integrations for state seed to sale systems. And our team is small so it sucks some of our attention away. But I feel like we're getting a fairly stable spot on like the databases we have behind us. Now, there's an eventual plan to move everything to a new POS and ERP, but that's kind of budget constrained on when that'll be at the moment, but feeling pretty good about like, hey, let's keep building on top of what we have because that could start, it was going to start this year. My guess is it's starting in two years and it's going to take us a year to get through anyway. So.
Juliana J: Yeah, that's awesome. That's really helpful background. And I definitely think like from the last call we had with Joey, we understood the need maybe for some automation. It sounds like you have a small team and we really want to get in there and enable you in the places where you're struggling. So it's cool to see, you know, coming from non data background.

So, I think that's an area where I've got to understand like, am I going to be an expand type Guy where I've got to Qlik on it to see what's really going on or do people really just navigate it like this to get the gist of what's going on?
Jenna H: Yeah. And so I love getting the feedback as to how you like to look at things and I think there's got to be like a happy medium here, right? Yeah. Can't.
Dave A: be full screen everything.
Jenna H: I mean, I personally am… like not the biggest fan of like full width screen because for me as a user, I have my laptop screen, which is what I'm looking at you on. But then next to it, I have a big monitor. And so when I'm working on pages on my big monitor, the full width full screen view is very like in your face and kind of feels like a little bit of a waste of space in, you know, formatting.
Dave A: Yep.
Jenna H: And so some of this… is understanding the end user and who is going to be looking at this? And, you know, what device are they going to be looking at it on? Does it need to be mobile friendly? You know, things like that. I think what I love about app studio too is you… can really… finesse and customize how the cards look in the app because you can also control things like the spacing within the card as well and how close the cards are together on the page versus how separate they are. So, I think… we talked about app studio. I think what we really, that is going to be the route to go because we will be able to tailor… that and create a really great end user experience.
Dave A: Yeah.
Jenna H: And you're 100 percent, right? All the pages on your left navigation bar, like those are so many, right? But we talked about… really, I've.
Dave A: got an issue where I mean, everybody's different and there's 80 boards here. It's like, okay, who's forecasting for this? Well, the issue is like I could go to blackstone forecasting, I could go to the leaderboard, I could go to the overview. I could go so many places, just show me the best place to go and kill all the others, right? I just want to see what the forecasts are, and I feel like the value you're going to add is like if I just go to forecasting overview for example, and I'm trying to figure out who is forecasting for an item and I say, okay, let's filter this down to the item two three two, two. I use that all the time, right? I want to see who's forecasting for it. That's a lot. It's like, is this the best graph that's going to show me who's forecasting for it? And when, and really the question that I have that I'm trying to solve for in that and that's what I'm trying to like trying to write down all these use cases. It's like, okay, who took the inventory? And who am I going to give this to? Well, I don't see orders here. So, I don't know like, okay, Fred Meyer forecasted a 1,050 in September. Well, I don't know if they're going to take them. I don't know if they did take them in the past. So even that, yeah, I can see who's forecasting great, but I don't know it's not actionable to look at it this way. So then I go, okay, well, let me go back and see the forecasting accuracy. Maybe I can glean something from there. And so, I'm coming here and I'm going, okay, same item who took the goods? And now, I'm looking at this going. Oh, Mike took them but shirsti didn't take any. So those balanced out. And so I've got these different things scattered all over the place and it's like we could really hone this in by use case of what we're trying to do.
Jenna H: Yes.
Dave A: And that is what has driven all these boards. It's like we've got a lot of different use cases for a lot of different people. And how do you manage that in app studio where we've only got eight tabs? So, maybe we arrive where, okay, there's a stats app studio, and then we have working boards to try and solve problems. Maybe that's a better way of looking at it or something like that, right?
Jenna H: Yeah. So I think with these pages that you have on your navigational page, what I'm hearing is that there was originally some foundational reports created. However as users went into Domo and started needing different pieces of information, there became a lot of ad hoc pages almost created that are targeted to a very specific end user.
Dave A: Yeah.
Jenna H: And so there is a really good chance that within this instance, we have duplicate pages that could be serving the same purpose with slight modifications. But because user a likes to look at things one way and user B likes to look at things a different way or built their page because they look at things a different way. We have two pages instead of one and a new user coming in doesn't necessarily know which one to use. Yep. Okay. An.
Dave A: Example of that would be when we said, okay, on the forecasting app, we've talked about note entry, right? So like one use case would be, I just need to see who's forecasting for an item that's not… this is the data entry piece. Probably if it doesn't function to see forecasting, we should probably fix that because that is where all forecasting is going anyway. And then you've got the forecasting leaderboard and this I use to rub people's noses in it a little bit, but doesn't need to have like everything on this board, like it can function to just these three, right? Just something to show on the TV. This one was requested of Keaton and said, hey, I need a place where Mike Moser can come and see that on this item, right? That he's seeing details about who's forecasting and what's going on. Are we getting orders? And then here's all those notes plugged in to show him what the team",Consumption Pricing Model,112011.84,Corporate,BLACKSTONEPRODUCTS.COM,4,Logistics & Wholesale Distribution,180,$50M to <$100M,Upsell,Blank,4: Confirm Solution,Simeon Nielsen,2025-12-16,2025-04-01,2025-04-01,2025-04-30,2025-05-21,,,,0013800001L9xIDAAZ

Bellamy agreed to involve the Talent Acquisition team to provide more information on the high-priority roles and diversity data, while Benjamin provided updates on the map development and assured Bellamy that the overall progress of the project would not be hindered.","Bellamy Y: hi, Ben.
Benjamin P: Hey, Bellamy. How are you?
Bellamy Y: Good.
Benjamin P: Did you have a good weekend?
Bellamy Y: Yes, how was your pto?
Benjamin P: It was great. It was great. I flew to, went to Indianapolis for the colts game. That was, we had a great time. Ooh. So, we won, still going.
Bellamy Y: Congrats. Good.
Benjamin P: We had a lot of fun. It was good. Just got back in my office yesterday, so, finally back in the swing of things, yeah, so I was able to pull in, I wanted to touch base on lever, on today's, call just so, we could be aligned on what was happening there. Okay? So, I appreciate you providing me with the credentials that was super helpful. I was able to pull in four data sets using the Json no code connector, using the credentials you provided for me. I've got opportunities stages, postings and sources in here. I think that these four data sets are going to give us, the majority of what we're going to need to produce, the metrics that we're wanting for the Ta dashboard, that relate to, hiring, and how long it's taking, postings to go through each stage. And, you know, there's, a, few different metrics. I know that, you did, you provided, a document, I think I have it pulled up here. You… provided this document, for, yeah, this is it right here. So, I did have a couple of questions that related to lever, since we've got this data in here now, and you're welcome to you're. Welcome to go go in here and look at this data. There's still some, probably some cleaning that'll need to be done. So I know in one of the, one of the metrics you had here, for lever is how many, offers per Ta manager? And then the data shows, the managers, as, let's see not opportunities but, let's… see postings. It shows, see like hiring manager has it just as like a key. And so, I have to pull in, the hiring manager's information, and then make that up. So, obviously, the key itself doesn't provide us with a lot of information, but using that new key, we can then join them. They use this information onto here. So, you can see some of it still sort of like in a Json format, but this can be cleaned up pretty easily. The main, few questions that I had that relate to lever and how we're going to, build these metrics for the Ta dashboard is, number… one, does lever provide you? Cause I've never logged into lever. I've never used it. So, I was wondering if, for some of these KPIs, like, the number of open roles, number of offers signed this week, are, these, is this data that you can get out of lever and provide me with, just examples of, you know, these are the number of open roles that we have today. That way I can get in the data and say, okay, let me see if I can match that number, same thing with the number of offers signed per week. Is that information that you can get from a report in lever that you can send to me so that I can try to match that similar to what we did for GA, for?
Bellamy Y: Yeah, one second. Okay. I just messaged my Ta manager, so should be able to get that.
Benjamin P: Back. Okay. Yeah. So we would, I would want it for like open roles, number of offers, and if some of these, so average time to fill. If some of these, we can't get, from lever based on the reports they provide, that's perfectly fine. But anything she can give me as an example or something that to reference it'll certainly help ensure that the data is accurate and consistent with what you're seeing, in the level platform, Another thing is, somewhere on here, there was. Oh, yeah. Okay. So where it says map of high priority roles, what… are you using to determine if a role, is a high priority? Because I've got these roles here. So, these postings, some of these being active right now, some of them not being active right now, was there a field in, is there a field in lever where you've marked something as a high priority? Or is that just something that, is it, what is the logic behind that? I guess?
Bellamy Y: High priority roles that's all questions? I think talent acquisition managers could answer?
Benjamin P: And I can put these questions that I'm asking in an email if it helps.
Bellamy Y: Yeah, that would be nice because then I can just forward it to the Ta, and then they might be able to just give it, give you the answer.
Benjamin P: Okay.
Bellamy Y: You said the offers and then the openings, right? Total number of openings?
Benjamin P: Yeah. Okay. So any of these, any of these rows here that say, lever?
Bellamy Y: Yeah.
Benjamin P: Now, obviously, this one says lever plus Monday. So, if it's if Monday, if the combination of these two data sets is the only way we can get to this metric, then I don't expect that you'll be able to provide me with an example and that's okay. But for these that are just solely lever, if I could just have something to compare to, it would help ensure that the numbers are consistent.
Bellamy Y: Okay.
Benjamin P: So, we got the high priority role. The other one is. So I was thinking through this talent acquisition dashboard… and these metrics that we're wanting to show that relate to lever. And I've got these sources and you'll see that if we look at opportunities and you look at some of these folks in here, we can see it tells us the source of where… they came from. So this one was LinkedIn. We can see that some of these are indeed agency… you know, whatever. And then we've got these sources here that tell me, you know, these are the different sources, LinkedIn, right? And it tells us how many it has a count. I'm assuming these are opportunities, the total count of opportunities for each of these sources. So I was thinking it would probably be, it would be really nice to see. Okay, yeah, we've gotten, you know, 12,000 candidates from indeed, but we've only gotten 800 from LinkedIn… but it could be that all 800 of the ones that came from LinkedIn were high quality leads as where only 200 of those from indeed are high quality leads, right? And so, I think that trying to measure… the effectiveness of the applicants… from source would be really helpful to those who are in Ta. So, you know, if we see that the leads or the not the leads, but ",Consumption Pricing Model,51200.0,Corporate,21HHS.COM,1,Healthcare & Health Services,25,$25M to <$50M,Upsell,Blank,1: Pre-Pipeline,Justin Labrum,2025-10-24,2025-09-30,,,,,,,001Vq000005wsrZIAQ

Amritanshu S: Yep.

Amritanshu S: Good. How about you?
Phil S: Doing good. Missed you. Tuesday was in there. Well, just for a little.
Amritanshu S: Bit. Yeah, Mike told me that you're here. He said he was meeting you later and I saw your email as well. How was your trip?
Phil S: Oh, it was good. It was quick. I mean, it was a lot, we were meeting with another customer that morning. So it was a long day of doing two of those onsites in one day and flying right back. Yeah.
Amritanshu S: If you're doing in and out the same day in general, like because airports are so busy these days, you end up kind of making it quite hectic.
Phil S: Yeah. So it was a lot, but always worth it, right? Always good to have some, you know, in person discussions. So, it was good. And I think we're it seems like from Mike's side getting, we were able to give him more of just an overview of, hey, what is demo, right? Like and thinking about it in a different way and trying to clarify like what it is we're doing. I think there was just some confusion there. So.
Amritanshu S: Yeah, he was, Mike was asking me also like where are we in our journey and how are we exploring? Etc. So I said that we just started on it. So I said we have a very specific use case for which we are exploring. So at least we are not like discovering we are more kind of let's… say proof of concept kind of stuff rather than like discovering like what can we do? Yeah, because in our case, the problem statement is pretty much very well defined.
Phil S: Yeah. Well, and he had a lot of good use cases that I think are the same problem statement as yours, but just different agent, you know, kind of use cases of like, hey, there's a plumbing, a certain plumbing regulation coming out in the city of Chicago, right? Like how can we have an agent find out, you know, where that's relevant?
Amritanshu S: So that's a very good topic to jump into the.
Phil S: Probably…
Amritanshu S: I think, you broke a little bit or there's I.
Phil S: think I'm back now, sorry?
Amritanshu S: Yeah. So that's a pretty good segue for us to jump onto the main point I wanted to discuss today. So one, like I have a few questions. So let me go one by one. So we have multiple use cases with respect to the chat agent or the chatbot if we're to so called, and even before we talk about that Chicago thing, which my course because we are also looking into that. But if we have let's not, if we have multiple metrics, forget about the use case. So star rating is something you saw that day. I was kind of exploring and playing with and I'm not talking about the text data. I'm talking about the number of reviews and ratings like, okay, who's how's this rating and all, if we have let's say another metric on that top of that called return rate. Okay. Now, ideally, I would want the user to have a one single chatbot where they can go and ask questions for their category for either of the metrics. But that also means like preparing the data because… the metric numbers are different, return rate would be in percentage, whereas rating is on a scale of one to five. So in such scenarios, do we create a similar backend like same backend with different metrics and callouts? Or do we have different agents? If we have different agents? Are they able to kind of, are we able to combine them and have like a common interface? If that case, that kind of question can come with respect to your point also which you mentioned around the plumbing thing, right? Because we wouldn't want to have five different chatbots. Hey, and so that then people, it becomes, oh, if I have to answer this question, I have to go to chatbot. A, if I have a topic like this, I have to go to chatbot. C. So, what is the, what are the options currently? If we have like say multiple chat agent how do we kind of take it to the customer?
Benjamin P: Yeah. So what I would recommend Amrit, is for a situation like this where you have several different groups of people who are going to be asking different types of questions about most likely for the same data set even if it's not the same data set that's okay too. But I think that having building a custom interface and getting our AI endpoints from that application would be the most would be the best way to do that because what you could then do is you could define your prompts for each type of question or for each category of responses that you want. And you could have a different prompt that you're giving to the AI depending on the type of question that it is. So you could first say, okay, AI, I want, you could have really like a two step process. First, AI tries to figure out what type of question it is or what type of response it wants. And then based on the answer to that, it could then use one of several different prompts that you've put together and use that prompt as what it will use to provide the user with the answer that it's looking for. And so we would do that in JavaScript with the custom application that we would build. And then we would just have all of our prompts defined inside the application. So, and I can show you, I think I have one that I can pull up just so I can show you.
Amritanshu S: Sort of.
Benjamin P: What I mean? And I can also share with, you know, how we typically use these endpoints and the syntax that will be required for interacting with them. And I'm here to help, right? I mean, I can build this out and then, you know, if you have the data set prepared, if you give me, you know, a week or so, I could go ahead and start building this out and then come back and then hand it over to you. I am working.
Amritanshu S: on that right now to prepare the data sets, like for different scenarios so that we can like try to stitch them together and see what happens.
Benjamin P: Okay, wonderful. So let's see. I'm pretty sure this is the instance where I already have one that I can show you. Let's see… All right. I think I just about have it pulled up. Bill, bill, how long have you been back from Atlanta? I just got back yesterday.

Ankit S: Cool. Yeah, I was there during the summer too, so, it was like definitely poppin' yeah, it was a lot of, a… lot of fun and I have some family around in Boston too, somewhere outside of Boston, like in the suburbs.

Benjamin P: I think that we're good here. If anybody joins, they can just join when they get here. Jack, I appreciate you sending over all the information that you did, last week, that was very helpful. I would like to dive into, these four use cases that you sent over in the email and kind of learn a little bit more about them and how we can begin executing on some of these and sort of prioritize them as well. So we can better understand where our focus, needs… to be, what we need to be focusing on first. So, yeah.
Jack B: I can just walk through them, I guess, sort of top to bottom. And again, like I put them in sort of like buckets. I don't know if they're the right buckets like whatever, but, the enhanced search one like this one is, this is a tactical pain point that folks have, like we have enabled. Let me just, share… my screen, Do you all see a browser?
Benjamin P: Or I see an excel spreadsheet?
Jack B: Oh, okay. That was me fighting with Salesforce. Let me, there. We go. Cool. So, like we, you know, we, no, that's probably not a good example, Like, one of the use cases we have is like, we have a couple different internal stakeholders that like, you know, we're startup accelerator. We've had a lot of different companies come through our programs. And, you know, we have others that have like applied and not been accepted and for various use cases like they're trying to find like a certain subset of those, right? Where it's like, hey, we're you know, we're responding to an RFP for a life sciences, client of ours, right? And we want to highlight, hey, like these are all the life sciences, you know, companies that have come through our programs, but sometimes it's a lot more specific than that, right? That life sciences company. Like, I don't know anything about life sciences. I should have picked a better example but like pretend we had a whole bunch of like keywords or something, right? Like specific, like, I don't know genetic testing or something. I don't know. And we're trying to find those companies. And like, you know, we, we've provided dashboards that, you know, let folks like narrow it down and obviously, like they can add filters and do like keyword search, right? So, like we have a lot of, or we have some unst or I guess, semi structured data, like, let me see like… we have these elevator pitches, right? Which is a couple paragraphs about that. It's like, you know, obviously, they can do some sort of, you know, keyword search here if they wanted. But, I don't know, and start to narrow it down. But, there, there's a whole bunch of these types of fields, right? Like these semi structured like open text, values and so, like it becomes clunky, trying to have them use filters where it's like, hey, I want you to look at, you know, because ideally, they want to look in the full elevator pitch and the short elevator pitch and what industries they're tagged in, et cetera. And like, we've gone down the path of like just smashing all those together in a giant like concat statement to like, you know, you can do keyword searching here. But like long story short, they're like often trying to find like this small subset of our companies and like the signal is sort of all over the place. So, you know, effectively that's the challenge they're contending with apps to, you know, again, I'm solutioning, I don't know if that is the right or wrong solution, but like that's the problem at a high level.
Benjamin P: So, the problem is, so this is focused on the elevator pitches, correct?
Jack B: I happen to be looking at these, but like, you know, there's a whole bunch of other ones right? Where they, you know, they may want to, you know, they want to look for, hey, let's find any company that has these 20 keywords in either one of these like 10 fields and, you know, or has, you know, a specific industry tagged and has, you know, they've raised more than, you know, I don't know 2,000,000 dollars in funding or something. Yeah. So that's sort of the challenge.
Benjamin P: Okay. So essentially doing some sort of fuzzing matching on any field, right?

Phil S: Man. Shadord, looks pretty good.
Jason J: Yeah, he looks pretty good. And now he hurt his oblique, so.
Phil S: Oh, man.
Michael D: Steve, young though, he's gonna bounce back from that. Oh,
Jason J: he'll bounce back, but I mean, it's gonna pretty much probably derail the rest of his preseason. I mean, not like he was gonna start anyways, but still.
Phil S: Gosh, who's gonna be the week one starter?
Jason J: Blacko?
Phil S: Blacko. Yeah. But, yeah, it seems like he'll play, I mean, maybe down the line in the season?
Jason J: Yeah, yeah, he's good. I mean, there's NFL talent there. It's it's obvious, still needs work, but, I mean, he did a lot of things, right? So.
Phil S: That's awesome.
Jason J: Yeah, it was fun to watch. But now, again, who knows what happens this week on Saturday now with him hurt?
Michael D: Welcome back Zach.
Zachary O: Howdy hope everyone had a good week.
Jason J: It was a week? Oh, crap. I was gonna at least show this off. I guess I threw it together. Do, do? The top is, so far what we've gotten in for, that… recycle project. So, we're at basically 5,000,000 in cogs and from the payments received so far, we're at 800 K.
Phil S: Oh, wow.
Michael D: That's up 300 K from last week.
Jason J: Yeah, yeah. And the bottom's just Jason, old, Jason's number, but I threw it there too.
Phil S: That's it's still a good number to remind people of, yeah.
Jason J: Yeah, I figured so, you know what? We'll we'll leave it there, but I just check here each day now and it makes it easier.
Phil S: Yeah, that's a great. So what would that put us at total? So, the four point nine, nine and we've only been doing this for what's… it projected?
Jason J: 22 days now. So, it's basically three weeks.
Phil S: Wait, three weeks and it's been what was it? 5,000,000?
Jason J: In cog in cost. Yeah. So cost of goods. Yeah, but the, the… money so far that we've gotten in has been the eight, oh seven from that point still?
Michael D: Impressive. Yeah, within that short timeframe.
Zachary O: three weeks. Yeah.
Phil S: Yeah. So, I mean, and you have?
Michael D: All the stores accounted for like the locations?
Jason J: No, we're still missing one there's. One that's not in this program yet. One out of the four.
Michael D: That's awesome.
Phil S: What has the reaction been? Jason, has Dan, given you any kind of insight as to like, hey, I showed this to Katie and she liked it.
Jason J: Well, Katie, Katie had me come to her, staff meeting Tuesday so she could give me a Homer award, but I mean, Homer awards are will be still?
Phil S: Awesome. Congrats.
Jason J: Yeah. So, I mean, it at least got recognized in front of that broader group. But, I mean, that's her staff meeting. It's just a bunch of people under her. So, they were like, oh, wow, this is cool. That's a lot of money. I'm like, yes, yes, it is. And this is what I do. You're welcome. Yeah.

Jason J: In a week in a week, it did.
Phil S: Yeah, negotiate that, just like, hey, just give me, you know, 10 percent of what I save, and then, I'll be good. Yeah.
Jason J: No, one way or another. This is leading to something. I just don't know what that something's gonna be. Yeah.
Phil S: Well, it's great work, and I think it's a good story. I've been stealing it and using it a lot. I think everyone at home depot that I'm talking to because it's just that's the first thing and that taught me.
Jason J: I mean, I can share this dashboard with you. You can show it to them if you want. I mean, it's nothing.
Phil S: Yeah, I mean, proprietary, I don't normally like bring up y'all's environment, but I think, yeah, most people like Todd and like all those, you know, the merchandising team Guy, like all these people, they're all like, well, why don't you just like, all right. What's the difference? You know, between tableau and like, well, yeah, just a great example. It's it's kind of nuanced, right? It's not like you couldn't build this same graphic in tableau?
Jason J: Oh, yeah, it just took me five minutes to do it. I mean, it, I mean, to me, it looks like it took me five minutes to do it too, but.
Phil S: Well, the data pipelining and all of that piece, that stuff.
Jason J: Yeah, that's the big stuff and that's what I told the one, I think it was, the merchandising Guy.
Phil S: Yeah.
Jason J: From paint or whatever that was like, it's I mean, you've got to do so much work to especially because of the tableau environment that we're in. We're in that localized one that has just certain amount of space or whatever. Yeah, like it's not like a full cloud instance, like most of their stuff is internal behind home depot's server, and I think even their cloud stuff, they don't have a big package with. So it's like you've got to compress everything down and make sure that you're… getting as small of pieces of data over to tableau to actual visualize. So, like there's no diving into the data through tableau. It's like it's for pretty pictures.
Phil S: What you end up with, I mean, like the merchandising Guy, like he's like he was kind of taken aback, I think of like starting at home depot, and like, wait, these are all it's all in pivot tables cause it's not even in tableau. I mean, they have access to dashboards, but then what ends up happening? If you can't deal with the volume of data, if you can't do the kind of manipulation, then you just end up in excel. And did he share with you the use case on like the paint desk? Did he talk to you about that?
Jason J: Not a whole lot. I mean, he had brought up that a lot of it was excel on that, and I showed him it's like, okay, we can start out like this.
Phil S: Yeah, just because I know, you love use cases like this. I'll tell you, the one that he's that we're going to try to do is the proof of concept, you know, like in a home depot store, they have the like if you're in the paint aisle, there's like the paint, they call it the paint desk. So it's kind of one of those like front like promotional items. So.

Kunal S: Yes, how was your weekend?

Kunal S: I'm doing good. How are you? Good?
Ted S: Thanks.
Juliana J: Awesome. I think Nick will be joining us in a little bit, and Brian might be joining us, but what we have to cover today is going over some updates on progress and a few questions on phase two of manning project with Kunal. Okay. I think we, Brian was out the second half of last week, so he's working through the skills matrix update still, and we should be able to get you an update on that next week… but, yeah, that's kind of where we're at with that. But, yeah, sounds good. I will. If there's nothing else you want to go over today, I'll hand it over to Kunal to go over updates on phase two of manning project.
Ted S: No, that's perfect.
Juliana J: Okay. Awesome. Kunal. Over to you.
Kunal S: Thank you. Yeah, I'll just share my screen. And let me pull up the contents in the screen. Yeah. Is it visible?
Ted S: Yeah, I see it.
Kunal S: Okay. So. If you, I'm not sure whether you, this… has okay just a second. So I'll just open the critical path. So last week, Ted, we have discussed around what's going to be the structure. I mean the basic layout and how we are going to progress. So this week we have like ramped up a little bit and I'll just show you like for this particular job that we are tracking constantly F5 one five eight, one for this job when we look into the packet type as proj, and then like for the packet name as nine X is leaf and for the lot as zero zero one. So now we have like let me just select our assembly. Yes. So for each assembly, we are going to get something like this wherein we finalize the critical path based on the total hours. So this 54 point four five is the total assembly hours. I mean for this particular assembly. And then what's the total critical path hour? It's 75 point three three. And if you want to get into more details for this, you can just Qlik on the path. Now. It would give you a breakdown of okay, which is the first path that is this one from here? Like two seven three five one three five. This is the first path which takes around 54 point four five. Then what is the second part? It's this robo. So this takes 11 point nine zero hours. And what's the third one that is this one eight to nine. It takes around seven point seven four hours. And then the final layer is this one which takes around one point two four hours. So having said that this is completely dynamic Ted, no matter we have 10 layers, we would get those many paths over here and individual breakdown as well as the total critical path hours that we have. So this is something that we have been like looking into setting up. Yeah.
Ted S: Okay. Yeah. I think that structure makes sense. I think the way we would be thinking about it might actually be flipped a little bit because that first assembly would be the final piece that we'd be working on. So really we'd be looking for the lowest level part. So I guess the highest item number that you had in that sequence and that's where we would be starting because we wouldn't be able to start on. Yeah. So in this case, we would probably be working on path assembly four first. And that would allow us then to work on three. At least. That's how I'm assuming this is structured is that would be our starting point at the highest, I guess highest number? Yes.
Kunal S: So this, we are going to follow the bottom to top approach. So we'll start with the base most granular part and from that, we'll start like forming the sub assemblies followed by assemblies and like getting the final product. Yeah.
Ted S: Perfect. Yeah. And I think in some cases, some of those assemblies may not have any weld. So I'm not no, N4 hundred or F4 one operations, but that's still the same logic I think applies all the way through. So no, that's good to see it represented this way. Is this ETL or the data set here shared with me? Is that something I can look at currently?
Kunal S: Currently, it's I'll just show you. So it, it's nothing from the magic ETL, it's combination of etls, and then like when you look into the data sets. So everything has been done through python scripting because it had multiple layers and I mean, like it's very complicated. So, we are not able to proceed through magic ETL and it requires like python scripts. So I've automated the process in python. And like I'm working in the python scripts, I'll just share this with you. So in this particular data set, you would see this particular part that I've added. So I'll share this data set with you and it's just for this one particular job for now. So once you give a confirmation, okay, this looks good and maybe we can start replicating it for the other jobs as well. No.
Ted S: That's actually probably a good use case you selected. I think a good one that has some complexity with some depth to it. So.
Kunal S: Absolutely. Let.
Ted S: Me, let me pull that one up and I can at least make sure that the data seems like it's pulling in the way I would expect.
Kunal S: And then meanwhile, step by step, I'll give you like the walkthrough of how exactly things are done. So it's like because it's in multiple layers and all needs to be dynamic instead of static. So it requires like more than one flows or more than one python script. So I'll just let you know how exactly things are happening. But, but yes, overall like this is something that's going to be in picture and also tell our next aim is, so we have also created one particular layout which you can just, I mean like this is not going to be exact.

Appu C: Hey, good afternoon, Lindsay. And I'm.
Lindsay G: out.
Mat W: Hi. How are you doing?
Lindsay G: Great. How are you doing?
Mat W: Well, thanks.
Lindsay G: Good. Did you guys have an opportunity to look over the documentation I sent in my follow up email last week?
Mat W: I didn't Qlik on a lot of the links, but I appreciated that they were sent. I just hadn't had a chance to go through a lot of them yet.
Lindsay G: Yeah, I just know they were requested, so I didn't know if anybody had a need for them or if we just want to walk through magic ETL.
Mat W: Yeah, I think we, and I'll let apu kind of confirm what we've had done, but I think we've uploaded some of our historical documents now, right? Apu. So I think we wanted to work with you, Lindsay to kind of build a card here that helps us through magic ETL, that helps us incorporate both legacy ERP data and new ERP data and bring those two data sources together to build like a card from both, you know, sources, one that is static and one that is kind of constantly refreshing.
Lindsay G: Of course. Okay. Could you mind sharing your screen with Dilma? Yeah, sure.
Appu C: Okay. Let me know if you can see my screen?
Lindsay G: I can see your screen. Yeah, I can see an excel screen.
Appu C: Perfect. So I just want to, I'll just quickly walk through, you know, what is this report and what are the two different data static and the PC one? Okay? So we have this set of jet codes, but I've broken down, you know, what are the tables we need to go and grab the fields? So table fields, and what are the filters and what are the connections? This would help us on this exercise? Okay. So for this, so this is the report we have currently. So what does this report do is we have information from? Yeah. So we have information from the legacy data. So for example, these are data from legacy which is static. It's not going to change. Okay? And we have the similar data coming in from our PC where we are going to execute this code. So I made a master file to grab both, you know, the static data and the dynamic changing PC data and just trying to have it in one common tab called master. And this will, you know, go and, you know, extract it in the graph and the user can use the slicer and, you know, they will see the analysis. Okay? For the static data, what we have done is we have created a master static data… which has also been uploaded into Domo. So this is the file that has been uploaded to Domo. So we have the job and all the required legacy information starting in 20 20 till BC was implemented. And I've tried to give it… you know, combined with, for example, this is the report we are going to work. And again, when we are going to practice another report, these are the information and another report, these would be the information. So I've classified by the reports we'll be doing in the future. So all we need to do is we need to go into Domo and it's called the legacy… master file, I believe. And we need to point out to the respective fields to grab the legacy data. Okay.
Lindsay G: Okay. So if you can bring up, Domo? Yeah. Okay. Let's go to the data tab… and can you go to on the left rail there's… the box that you're currently on, which is the data warehouse tab. Then below that is the data sets tab. So, sorry, just to the left of where your mouse currently is. Yeah, this rail up at the top is the data warehouse that we're currently on?
Appu C: This one? Okay? And then, oh,
Lindsay G: no, no, no, sorry. Can you go back? Can you see if I draw on your screen?
Appu C: No… yes, no, yes.
Lindsay G: Okay. So this is where the data warehouse lives. This is just a high level overview of everything you're connected to in your warehouse, your Domo warehouse. Then the next tab down is data sets. So if you go down and Qlik on that icon, this is where you will find all of your data sets that you've brought in. There's the data flow that Alex created, but this is the output data set of the data flow.
Appu C: Yep.
Lindsay G: The next tab down are your data flows.
Appu C: Okay.
Lindsay G: And this is what houses all of your data flows that you can go Qlik into and see the inputs, outputs, the history version control as well as edit below. That is your authentication account. So you're not currently connected to anything that requires this. So nothing's populated here. And then you have your beast mode manager. If you've created any beast modes on any visuals. Likely… these are all beast modes that are being utilized on the sample dashboards that Domo provides. But this is where you could go and transfer… your beast modes to different data sets if needed. That's where this would be. And then this bottom icon here is just your data… science tab. Let's go back to data and let's Qlik on the etls icon… and let's go ahead and create a new ETL by clicking transform data… magic ETL. And you said you have your historical data in here, already, right?
Appu C: Yes.
Lindsay G: Okay. So we're going to drag this input tile right here. There you go. Okay. And we're going to choose that table right here. Perfect. Go ahead and Qlik on choose data set. Okay. So if I'm understanding correctly, this table includes a pre joined table. So you've got multiple tables joined on job number in this one last legacy master data set. Is that correct?
Appu C: I'm not sure. All I know is this file has been uploaded and I don't know how the joint has been made.
Mat W: Okay. But that is exactly correct. Like, you know, apu, you put this file together right? From multiple files, right? And you've joined the data by the job number.
Appu C: That's right? Yes.
Mat W: So, this gives you information Lindsay like grams per plant like abc percentage. These would be typically things that we would find in different tables, right? That we've tried to bring all of it onto one table. So that when we're referencing this legacy data, we can pull this one table and get a lot of the flower information for every job out of this one table.
Lindsay G: Yeah. Okay. So when we're joining the live data to this data set, we need to replicate those joins in th",Consumption Pricing Model,86250.0,Corporate,THECRONOSGROUP.COM,1,Retail,447,$100M to <$250M,Renewal,Blank,2: Determine Needs,Karlie De Vries,2029-04-01,2025-01-22,2025-01-22,,,,,,0013800001Ms6YZAAZ

Spencer M: It was a fun one. Are they still going?
Scott T: Oh, yeah, but I'm not, I'm actually not on the account anymore. I was able to.
Spencer M: Pass that on. Get out of it. It's like get out of.
Scott T: It, but not get out of it. I have implemented your suggested potential data. Yeah. Just what did you do for?
Spencer M: Us? Yeah. So I mean, I'm essentially just their Tc. So I do all of the, I do workbench connectors and then the data flows and governance. And then I have a counterpart Brian, who does all of the, he works directly with our teams, does the requirement gathering, builds what he can. And if he needs any assistance upstream from that, then we work together to build up the pipelines.
Scott T: Okay. So you sit in it or do you sit? Yeah.
Spencer M: We're under the it realm. So we mostly deliver to our clients. Accounting slash finance. And then we have some specific teams that we work with that are more with field like they're working with people in the field. And our main three use cases right now are finance accounting. That is two separate use cases because they're actually two different teams for us. And then we have an HR initiative that we're slowly getting spread out through the company. And we have two more teams that we're onboarding over the next few months to get some of their reporting bestowed up in Tomo. Awesome.
Scott T: And are there other? So those other teams that are not part of the Domo or aren't using Domo right now. What… are they currently using for their reporting? Is it, is there another product there? Are they using excel? Like what's the?
Spencer M: There's none?
Scott T: None? Yeah.
Spencer M: Yeah, that's a, it's either Domo or there's no reporting. So, awesome. Just so what happens for our business is we're owned by private equity. And the way that the private equity firm wants us to grow is by acquiring small mom and pop businesses. And so those mom and pop businesses don't have a lot of any infrastructure built up. Sometimes they don't even have email addresses for their employees. And so we give them, we bring them on for like the employee personnel, keep the management teams that work to function on those cases. And then we get them set up into our own systems and give them the infrastructures they need to help scale. And so it's like it's kind of a win for us is that we get to grow without having to go through the HR system of finding all these people and then their owners either get to cash out or they get to stay on and reap the benefit of coming into a pipeline. And so a lot of the people haven't had any form of KPIs or anything that they keep track of. They're just kind of doing their day to day business. And so, a lot of what we provide isn't necessarily to like people that are working out on the field. But we're maintaining all of the teams that are involved and making the financial decisions on how much do we spend or can we purchase more companies? And do we need to buy or slow? So it's an interesting aspect from that world.
Scott T: Cool. Sorry, Ivan. I'm done interrupting, please.
Jenna H: Thanks, Spencer. Now, it's my turn to interrupt.
Scott T: Spencer… I.
Jenna H: miss your face. Are you not going to turn your camera on for us?
Spencer M: I have to plug my iPhone in and then use my iPhone as the camera because I don't.
Jenna H: have a webcam. Oh, really?
Spencer M: Well, I do it's. Just my computer. Only lets me do one external monitor if I have the lid open. So I have to keep it closed.
Jenna H: Well, that stinks. Yeah, I'm so happy you're here.
Spencer M: Me too, me too.

Scott T: Top.
Ivan S: So this is just your high level overview of your adoption account team. Here. I'll be your project manager for the adoption engine program. We have Scott and Jenna who'll be the consulting resources. They'll be helping with technical adoption roadmapping execution, Sharon who'll be helping with navigating roadmaps, scoping, she'll be the CS solutions director, and she'll also be acting as the adoption engine manager. We have adoption programs that you can also leverage such as the ace program, Domo preferred support. And then you also have access to Domo education that is fully included without… any… charge as part as the program. And then we can also leverage some other resources such as self solution engineers to help demo features, demoing, solutioning and enable any necessary features, customer success manager for program management and adoption, strategic advisors, facilitation, and account strategy assistants. And then Jake will be your account executive throughout the program and he'll be your main point of contact throughout the program and after so… and then all.
Jenna H: Right. This is where I get to tell you about all the wonderful things about the adoption engine program. And I know Jake has talked to you about it and I kind of crashed your last meeting with Jake and talked to you a little bit about it. But some of the big key call outs here because there's a lot to the program and it's new and it's evolving. So what is not going to change? And what I think the best features are to call out as well when you talk to like Kyle and things like that. Are you guys get two dedicated. They called me a technical consultant here, which is just great.

Vu N: Hey, morning. Keep doing well, man. How are you?
Ankit S: Good, good. I just enjoyed a good, well needed Labor Day weekend.
Eric G: Just.
Ankit S: taking a moment to kind of just chill out and spend time with family and friends and not run around too much. So, yeah. How about you guys? Anything fun over the long weekend?
Eric G: Nothing too crazy, pretty similar.
Ankit S: Yeah.
Vu N: Yeah, I know a two hour zoo trip turned out to be five hours in a 93 degree weather. So, I need a break from my weekend.
Ankit S: Vu, you're also in Colorado? Oh, sorry, Miami. Okay. Oh, well, that makes more sense as to why the weather's the way it is. You still probably got like another month or two until it cools down, right?
Vu N: Yeah.
Eric G: Yeah.
Vu N: Hopefully.
Ankit S: Cool. Hey, Aishwarya. Good morning.
Aishwarya D: Hi, good morning. How was the long weekend?
Ankit S: Good. Yeah, we were all just catching up on that and well needed.
Aishwarya D: Yeah.
Ankit S: And, yeah, I guess while we're waiting for anyone else, I want to say, we have everyone here, just want to say, thanks again for just the patience as we were trying to figure out the next round of hours and where that may be coming from. I know Eric and Kate were also on site with you guys, and that took up a lot of time. But good news that we got the hours and then even better news on our end and for your team as well. Aishwarya is staying with us for the remainder of this month, hopefully through October, but I don't know.
Eric G: Let's hope.
Ankit S: We'll see.
Eric G: Yeah. And Vu, I think I said this to Vu as well. But Vu, I appreciate the support from your end too on helping us figure out kind of the hours and the plan for making sure that this project keeps moving. So, thank you. Thanks to everybody. But I wanted to mention that to Vu.
Vu N: Of course, I told the team especially when Eric and Kate and Scott were on site this FP, a like, yeah, I'm discussing a lot of things with Domo on the side in terms of like architecture and making our instance a little bit more efficient and thinking about data governance as a whole, however, like I will pause all those discussions. This is top priority for us and like we need all hands on this FP a, so I'm… going to pause all like separate discussions with Domo, like we need full focus on this.
Eric G: Awesome. Sounds good. Guys. One thing I wanted to catch up on just because it's been a while since we talked before we get into kind of whatever is on your backlog in terms of questions to be answered at the same time we were going through this exercise that we, you guys like just to back up like we sent these slides over to you guys, you're working on essentially reproducing them in Domo within a dashboard. And then downstream, we were like, okay, maybe there's a way to integrate, you know, that Domo view with powerpoint. So the slides just auto populate each month in a pretty format. I think the more time that we're spending on this project and this hopefully makes life easier for you. The critical thing for us right now is getting all of those metrics that are in the slides with the ability to filter of course into Domo. I think as I'm coming up to speed and kind of working through, you know, what should our slide deck look like that we review each month? And what should the content be like that's? Most likely going to continue to evolve. And likely in the short term, it will continue to change especially, you know, because I just got here and there's you know, new things we're looking to show et cetera. So I think what I wanted to call out is let's focus more on getting all of the data in one place in Domo validated and accurate and less on the second portion of like creating like super pretty slides that can easily be refreshed because I think with those slides in flux, I think we can handle that downstream because we'll probably have to build some things in excel on our end for new views we're creating and stuff like that. But the goal is me or Alberto, or Scott or Isaiah from orion or Vu, or whomever can go to… like this Domo view and hit refresh, and basically see everything that we have in the slides today. So anyway, I just want to call that out like the actual formatting and integration with powerpoint and all that stuff. Like I think the more I'm in this seat like that should take a back seat to like that's. Not really that relevant at this stage. I just want to get the data right within Domo first.
Aishwarya D: Yeah, no, that sounds like a good plan because when we started building out the cards, we were also simultaneously working and looking at the UI UX and the brand kit. So it would put us, I think in the right direction if we just have one thing going, so we can go step by step after we get the metrics in place and validate the data. It won't be a heavy lift to convert that into a nice looking pretty looking dashboard. So I think you're on the same page with that.
Vu N: Okay, cool.
Aishwarya D: All right, Ankit, do you have anything else to cover or should I just dive right in? Nope.
Eric G: We can jump right in.
Aishwarya D: Okay, perfect. Thank you. The last call we had with Vu, we discussed a lot. I think we covered almost every slide shared in the PPT. We already have most of it on the dashboard that is shared with you PL validation. It's not the layout isn't looking great right now, but the cards are there. So you can go ahead and start validating the numbers, what you would want, what you want to maybe move shift, change, any calculations… regarding the remaining cards that you still don't see on the dashboard. We shared an updated deck with you with notes at the bottom. And I know Brian, you replied to most of the questions. So I needed the detailed calculations that I discussed with Vu. So I will be still waiting on that plus the opco mapping file. I know there are not a lot of names, but if you can just send the list… Vu, I think you received that mail, I don't know if it's lost. I can send it back to you.

Eric G: Hey, how's it going?
Aishwarya D: This is going good. I'm looking forward to this call. Brian. I didn't hear back from you on the budgets. I'm hoping we can cover that topic today.
Brian W: Okay. Yeah. Let's do it.
Aishwarya D: It'll be just me and Kyle from our end today.
Brian W: All right.
Aishwarya D: Do we have anyone else joining from your end?
Eric G: I don't know if boo is on here. But we can go ahead and get started either way.
Aishwarya D: Okay. All right. Oh, is that, are you guys sitting in the same room and is that Brian?
Eric G: We are… yeah, we're traveling this week and spending some time with the rest of the team here, so you can see both of us.
Aishwarya D: Yes. Oh, that's nice. All right. So we can get started. Did you get a chance to look at the pivot table that we shared for data validation? Maybe that's a question for boo as well as the budget details we discussed that we'll be adding amount column to it. I can pull that up.
Eric G: Okay.
Aishwarya D: Just give me a second. So, this was the validation card wherein we have the class because we needed to see the breakdown by class. So we have account grouping broken down into classes, and we can also add summary line item for a further granularity. So, let us know if you would like to see that as well. So, we have all the columns in place. We don't have the trend charts here because this is just for data validation.
Brian W: Sure.
Aishwarya D: And I think you have access to these cards?
Brian W: Yeah. I was going to ask, I'm looking in Domo right now to see.
Aishwarya D: Yeah, you'll find it in shared under shared. Can you check?
Brian W: Oh, I see. Okay, new validation card, okay?
Aishwarya D: Yep.
Brian W: Which is painful. Okay. I see it now.
Aishwarya D: Okay. Yeah. So once you get a chance, you can look into the data, see if the numbers look okay. This is filtered for April first to April. So you can toggle and check for other months.
Brian W: Okay.
Aishwarya D: And then there was another card, which again… which is only for validation. So I haven't worked out the UI UX for it. These are the entries that are missing from the budget data.
Brian W: Okay. So.
Aishwarya D: We were trying to identify if it's expected. We said if the amount is coming out as zero, then it's fine if it's not in the budget, but we are getting an amount from the data flow. Okay? So, I'm expecting this to be in budget, but it's not. Would you want me to share the budget data set as well?
Brian W: Yeah. If you could please, I will say this for budget. When you look at revenue specifically, we use planning level accounts. So I think maybe anything that's not mapped there can just be booked to a general revenue account. Let me see which one we could potentially use.
Aishwarya D: Just a second. I'm adding the link in chat?
Brian W: Yes, please.
Aishwarya D: Let me check if you have access.
Brian W: Test. no, it doesn't look like it's opening for me in Domo. I don't see a button to request access either?
Aishwarya D: Is it throwing any error? Can you share your screen?
Brian W: Yeah, nothing's coming up… this one? Let me copy the link in chat one more time.
Aishwarya D: Is there some other window? I can see something at the bottom? Is some other window overlapping?
Brian W: I don't think so. Can you?
Aishwarya D: Just Qlik on the data tab. It's not opening anything. Let's Qlik on, just search for budget. Oh, in data flows. Sorry, if you go to data flow on the left. Yeah, no. The third one, yes. Maybe it's not shared with you, let me quickly check. Yeah, only Vue has access to it. So, should I share access with anybody else for the budget data?
Brian W: I think at least myself and Eric at minimum, yeah.
Aishwarya D: Okay. Let me share it with you and Eric right now. Yeah, it, should… you should be able to see it now. Can you refresh once?
Brian W: Give me another minute or so.
Aishwarya D: And if it's not popping in data flows, then maybe try datasets.
Brian W: Check this one. There we go. I see it now. It's in datasets. Okay? Perfect. Amount count. Okay?
Aishwarya D: And if we can also open the card that we were looking at for budget. No, not this.
Brian W: Oops. The.
Aishwarya D: card I shared, let me share that link. So I'll just walk you through how we can speed up the process. I've added the link of the card in the chat.
Brian W: Okay. So the account's that person? Okay?
Aishwarya D: Yes. So if you were to filter on any row in the dataset, so in the dataset, if you pick an account class id location from here, you will not get budget entry. So we can just do one. If you don't mind. Yeah.
Brian W: If we could walk through an example here, please, yeah.
Aishwarya D: So, let's pick one example. You want to start with row one? Yep. Yeah. So let's search account number as 40,000 in the dataset, budget dataset. You should see filter option under. Yeah, right there. And, yes, correct. Then the next one was class… id is C 18. Yeah. And so on. Location id as advanced mic service. Yeah… location, do we have location name? Okay? That has popped up. And then department id as D1 oh six. So we don't have any department id for?
Brian W: This company? Okay. Yeah. Okay. This is from the budget data, right? Yes, advanced mechanical.
Aishwarya D: So we will need this for this combination. We'll need department id to be populated.
Brian W: Okay. Let me just check something really quick. I'm pretty sure. At least for that one, I mean, that's an hvac or helios company. Let's see where they put their stuff in and we might have to change the budget data source. I hope not, but we might. Because department is a required field. Advanced mechanical. They all put it maybe under… H vector only. At least on this one that C a T that we're looking at, they didn't put at least based on the budget data, any departments in here?
Aishwarya D: So in case, if there are exceptions like for this account number, we shouldn't consider department id, like ",Consumption Pricing Model,462834.6253846154,Corporate,ASTRASERVICEPARTNERS.COM,2,Professional Services,0,< $5M,Upsell,Blank,3: Demonstrate Value,Eric Smith,2026-01-09,2025-03-10,2025-04-30,2025-08-05,,,,,0015w00002qxRuTAAU

So, thanks for still taking our call today. Brian had put together some content to go over just some team structures as we had talked about the last time. So we thought that might be beneficial going into hiring and making sure that, you know, you have the right staff supporting Domo. So we just, we thought that would be helpful and then we're happy to, you know, pause things until you guys are ready to pick things back up, but just wanted to get this over to you and yeah, start that conversation. So, yeah… I'll hand it over to Brian.
Brian F: All right. Let's see. Let's put this in presentation mode. Okay? So, yeah. So just like Juliana says, we're just, we want to make sure you have the team structure. And as you're thinking about, you know, especially expanding the Domo, inside your organization, there's some things we want to make sure that you take into account as you do that. The first step here, I want to just quickly go over these roles. We'll go over a little bit more in detail a little bit later on. But these are the four major roles that you have. You're going to have inside of your organization. It could be one person. It could be multiple people. You're going to have your executive sponsor, which is you, who's going to be at the top level and is going to be sponsoring this. Your major Domo is going to be that person that's going to be overseeing Domo as a whole. Again. Is it one person? Is it two? It depends on how big your organization is. In this case, Ryan, it's you, then you get your data specialists in this. You likely are going to have multiples of these that's the people that know your HR data, your marketing data, and really know where it is, how to bring it in and all the ins and outs of it. Then you have your Domo master. Those are your people that really know Domo, how to use the tool, how to use the platform, how to get done, what you need to get done, that sort of thing? So, sorry?
Juliana J: I'll go back.
Brian F: Oh my goodness.
Vineet R: So the data specialist is one of it's our data person on the technology team, right? So, the roles that I'm having, so we already have a data engineer, Mason, if you guys have talked to him, but we also are bringing in a couple of other roles, a data architect, and a data analyst. So, I'm thinking maybe them, but they won't know exactly right now. Obviously, they have to get used to get familiar with where the data is stored. And then when you talk about the analyst and product expert, these are the people who are actually extracting the information from Domo and running the reports and creating the views for our executives, right?
Brian F: Yeah. It'd be your content, the people that are making the content. Yeah, I want to say, sorry, like the dashboards, the app studios delivering the dashboards, yeah.
Vineet R: Okay.
Brian F: Or I say that, I mean, I say that, but really like the platform is so vast, it could also be, you know, we have workflows and all this other stuff and AI, and so there's going to be a bunch of",Consumption Pricing Model,108070.0,Corporate,MAGNOLIAREALTY.COM,8,Media,567,$100M to <$250M,Renewal,Blank,2: Determine Needs,Bria Rogers,2026-04-28,2025-03-29,2025-03-29,,,,,,0013800001FjROjAAN

I look at the last couple of months and there's been some jupiter usage and that's not in here anymore, just based off of what you said, I expect that to probably not be in here.
Shailaja G: Yeah.
Scott B: At least to the same degree in the future. Yeah. So that has accounted for about 900 credits. And if I look at last month, there's… about 900, you know, 1900. So if we take that out, then we're looking at about a 1,000 credits a month.
Shailaja G: Yeah.
Scott B: Now, you guys still have plenty of run room like we're not going to run out until like you said, maybe October. So what I'm looking at is if we just do a 1,000 credits a month, You know, based off of current usage. So we're at 60 65 Ish for now. So if we continue to just look at this throughout the rest of the year until March, I'm estimating you're going to need about 14,000 credits. Now, I'm also expecting you to find a few new use cases, maybe not a lot, but a few. So what I have here is there's three options that I've built into one is if we keep the same term dates, we don't extend contract at all. All we do is add credits to this current term in the next year because we still have one year left on an agreement. Our current contract is 28,000, And that includes 10,000 credits and bond support. So if we want to bump it up to 16,000 credits, that would add 6,000 credits this year, Which would be there's, a 12,000 dollar invoice for, that would just get us through the current term. And then we would add that 12,000 dollars to next year, Which brings your total spend to 40,000. So that's option a, Option B is we start a new contract term, do a new three year that allows me to get you a better price per credit. And then we can also prorate this. And I'll show you what I mean. So this is a new three year agreement. So the annual spend is still 40,000. However because we're prorating it, I'm able to just do like the, you know, we take the full 12,000 dollars and divide it up by how many months are left through this current term, which is like eight or something like that, right? And so that gets us to an invoice amount of 6,300. I also am able.
Shailaja G: to, until March.
Scott B: Yeah. So that takes us through March. That would give you a dollar 25 per credit because essentially what we're doing is on years two, full year two. So we get through this year one, we bump it up to 45,000. So in March, your invoice would be for 45. And then in years two, we get the spend up to 50,000, that allows me to give you the dollar 25 for all three years because we're getting up to the seven. Anyway. Now, I do think this is probably more credits than you need because this is kind of limited. So for next year, we go from 10,000 credits to 36,000 credits, which is kind of limited, right? Because the decrease in price per credit plus the increase in spend, maybe you don't need the full 36,000 credits or 40,000 credits in years two and three. So the next option includes an ace program. So essentially what this is it's prorated through again through March. The proration amount is the same but I've lowered the number of credits because we still have to account for ace. And I think this is probably more falls in line with your usage. So next year instead of having 10,000 credits, you'd have 20,000 credits. But because of the decrease in price plus the ace program, you know, essentially this is like an hour and a half a week with an ace consultant. The price on these three are exactly the same as this. It just has fewer credits which I think kind of more aligns with the path the projection that you guys have. But it gets us up to the 50,000 in year two, full year two. And then it gives us a dollar 25, 24,000 credits with an ace consultant. So these are kind of the three options that I've built up. You can always swap out an ace consultant for more credits. So let's say maybe in like years two, you're actually on track to maybe do, I don't know 40,000 credits instead of 24 and you're not getting as much value anymore out of ace because you guys have kind of gotten with the hang of things or hired somebody, then you can replace the ace consultant. You can swap it out for credits if you want to. You can do that.
Shailaja G: Okay. So on the other slide for just this remaining period, we either get no… the one slide below that. So we could get another 12,000 credits or you're saying go for 6,000 credits, the slide below. So the comparison between those two, it's 32,000 credits in total, correct?
Scott B: 32,000 credits at a dollar 25. And that's how we got to the 40,000. Okay. Now, I have removed bronze support from this. Okay, if we wanted to keep bronze, then it would be 48,000.
Shailaja G: Okay.
Scott B: That would be 53. Now, I looked at tickets and you guys don't have very many tickets and I don't know if you're getting much value out of the trainings that are available through bronze support. There are still free trainings, but there are some paid trainings that come with bronze support. If we wanted to keep bronze, you certainly could, it would just be an additional 8,000 on each of these. Okay, this one because we're not extending the contract. This does keep bronze support on here. But again, this isn't extending the agreement. This is just considering the same agreement. We're just adding more credits at the same price.
Shailaja G: Okay. Same credits, but just, we p",Consumption Pricing Model,28000.0,Corporate,ENVEDABIO.COM,2,Life Sciences,1,$10M to <$25M,,,,,,,,,,,,,001Vq0000021RTFIA2

Brian M: Good afternoon. How's it going?
Nik K: How about you?
Juliana J: Doing well. Hey, everyone.
Brian M: Good afternoon.
Juliana J: Hello. I know Ashley was out this week, right? Correct. Okay. And then Brian from our side is out this week as well. So I think we've got everybody unless Mackenzie was going to join. Do you guys know if Mackenzie was going to join or should we just get started?
Brian M: I don't know Brian.
Nik K: Do you know?
Brian M: No, I've not talked to Mackenzie today, so I don't know if she had anything else or if she was planning on joining.
Juliana J: Okay, cool. And I know she isn't fully transitioned yet, either into her role. So, okay, either way, we're recording. So I'll definitely send out the recording to everybody. I believe today, we wanted to go through building out a workflow. Okay. Awesome. So Nick will help lead that out. Is there anything else you wanted to cover while we're on the call today? Anything else that came up in the last week since we've talked?
Brian M: No, I don't think so.
Juliana J: Okay. All right. Awesome. With that, we can get started, I'll hand it over to Nick.
Nik K: All right. So, for the workflow, I think last time we briefly started talking about some of the processes we could help with, right? So we spoke about potentially cleaning up data. So when an account is open and there's a date missing or tax id or something missing, right? For a process to go back, identify those gaps and then email someone or notify someone to go fill it, there was something similar around vendor classification as well if that's missing. So that's one pattern, right? Of missing information, the other pattern was around requesting approval. So a rate exception, for example, right? Or if there's a special account and a special rate is applied, who it should go to. And then a human can kind of approve and override what's in the system. And then the third one we talked about was just keeping two systems in sync which might be better for like a later date, a more advanced workflow. Okay? Is there one of those you want to start with or did another example come up? You know, after our last conversation that you want to see built out?
Brian M: I think one of the things we had been talking about last week as well was being able to send the link… to a report without having the data be displayed in the body of an email? Was that something that we had thought that workflows would be able to accomplish? Yes, or is that a separate thing?
Nik K: Yes, workflows can do that. Yes.
Brian M: All right. Do you think we could take a look at, do a start with that kind of example?
Nik K: Yeah. Okay. Yeah, we can do that one real quick and then maybe we can do one of the other data ones as well. So it kind of shows you two capabilities. All right. Okay. Do we have an example for a data set we might want to send? Just create a dummy as well?
Brian M: Sure. Just a sec. Let's see.
Nik K: I'm sorry, just to clarify a link to a report or an attachment, right?
Brian M: Yeah, probably… the attachment. Yeah… trying to remember which of these dashboards we were emailing people with this one.
Nik K: And if it's.
Brian M: well, here's an idea, we've got some cards… that are converted reports from another system. Okay? So we can just grab any one of those. Some of those are being emailed to various people and we can just use that as the example. Okay?
Nik K: Do you want to send a link or a name of a card?
Brian M: I'll just grab this one.
Nik K: And you might have to share it with me. It looks like I don't have access to much here, but if there's a name, I can look it up as well. Yeah.
Brian M: I just put a link to the card in the chat.
Nik K: Okay, perfect. Yeah. Table card. Okay? And, you just want the table piece to go out with it, right? I think this, we could. Yeah. But, yeah.
Brian M: So, so, basically, if you create a report to send this out to set people's emails, yeah, it gets attached as a excel document. And then the body of the email also just kind of displays the table.
Nik K: Right, right.
Brian M: So, what we want to be able to do is be able to include the file attachment in what's get sent but not have it displaying… the data in the body in case there happens to be, a report that has some sensitive user data that we don't just want visible whenever they open the email, okay?
Nik K: Okay. So in that case, I'm just going to take a look at the configuration of the card here. Okay? So, you're just calling out columns from a data set, no filters, right? Essentially, the whole data set is what needs to go, right?
Brian M: Yeah. For the, for this particular example. Yes, the, like I said, there, there's a set, of reports from a different reporting system that we converted to Domo. And so, yeah, these are just,
Nik K: got it individual.
Brian M: SQL queries for these cards because we were like, well, they're already built. So we just import these directly into Domo and then build cards for each individual report in order to kind of speed up conversion.
Nik K: Okay. So… what we'll do is we can create a workflow… that will send just a table behind this, right? So we don't even need the card. In that case, what we'll do is we'll query this table and send its contents, right? I think that's the card is effectively doing that at this point. So in that case, let's head over to workflows. So I'm just gonna back out of this. So to get the workflows right under your more panel, you'll see your workflows right there. And… okay, looks like you were poking around and doing some things, but we'll create a new one here. So blank workflow, then… data table email. Okay. So… to start a workflow, we need a couple components, right? One is what's going to trigger it, what, and then what actions is it going to take? And any data that it needs to pull in as part of the process? So for the trigger, we can start this off just as a manual trigger, right? But eventually we can schedule this to run or we can say whenever this data updates have the workflow trigger and run. So… we'll start it off manual for now, but we'll come back to the triggers ",Consumption Pricing Model,122200.0,Corporate,BEACONCU.ORG,2,Financial Services,193,$25M to <$50M,Renewal,Blank,2: Determine Needs,Kate Kranz,2026-04-30,2023-04-25,2023-04-25,,,,,,0015w00002hvarUAAQ

Trevor F: Can you guys hear?

Ivan S: No worries. We still have, 21 minutes. I'm not sure if you got to see my agenda, but we may not get to everything just given that it's, been nine minutes, but, we could like, we could start with, I brought in Nate to kind of give a demo of different AI slash ML tools. And then, I know you mentioned that you were, in the process of hiring a data analyst, so we can also discuss how you want to incorporate that into the adoption engine. And then, if we have time, we can also discuss, the other, use cases that we discussed in the kickoff back in July and how you want to incorporate them into the adoption engine? Does that sound like a good agenda for you?
Trevor F: Yeah, sounds good.
Ivan S: Nate, do you want to get started?
Nathan E: Yeah, good to see you again, Trevor. It's been a while, but my name is Nathan. I've been at Adobe for 10 and a half years. I head our AI sales practice. So, I usually work with customers if they have initiatives behind data science, machine learning or AI solutions to solve some sort of a business objective. We… talked a couple times on like inventory, forecast, retention, dynamic pricing, or card optimization, but I always want to just direct our attention towards the, where you have inertia coming from executive leadership and like things you're trying to solve for this year, strategically,
Jenna H: Yeah.
Trevor F: Yeah. So that's kind of the thing, is there's not really like anything or anyone kind of breathing down my neck about some kind of machine learning? you know, solution. Sure. And that's kind of where, you know, like on our last couple of calls, like I was really interested in, to see, if you guys have any insight, you know, after working with all these clients of like, what is working, for other companies? Where, where do you guys see other companies being successful? you know, with machine learning, AI, you know, within Domo, I, you know, I, over the last week, I do have, you know, some ideas, that we can certainly, certainly go off of. but I was really interested, you know, just from your guys' experience, in working, with other clients, maybe in a similar space of like, what is actually working and successful for other people to ultimately drive value?
Nathan E: It, it always comes in machine learning. It always comes down to the return and the volume, right? We, we have to pick big enough use cases that are high enough volume where small improvements like incremental improvements have a.
Trevor F: a.
Nathan E: a big impact on the business. And so that usually happens, in sales or finance where the two major families are classification forecasting, almost everyone needs to forecast something on the retail side. It's to help you optimize your inventory, right? We don't want to have too much. We don't want to have too little. We don't we want to avoid stock house, but we also don't want to carry all this excess inventory that we have to warehouse and store and produce. And it's just excess capital sitting somewhere on a shelf. Classification is for things like customer retention. We've done some retail use cases where we're predicting whether someone's going to make a purchase in this next year, and when they might make that purchase so that we can message effectively, we can run the right promotions. If they're off pace. We can run certain promotions to certain demographics that are, they have a high predicted lifetime value with a company. So those are the two major families being more predictive about what's coming in and trying to identify risk or opportunities that we can actually act on. On the marketing side, big shift. It's a lot of optimizing spend, right? Where are we going to get the biggest bang for the next marketing dollar or the next 10,000 or 100,000 marketing dollars? Like what channel and what products might we push in that channel that are going to be receptive or received well by the demographics that engage with us through that channel. And these are cursed problems, right? They're never problems that we quote unquote solve. We're getting better. We want to see a one or a five or a 10 percent improvement. And then we make sure that the volume is there to make sure that a five percent improvement is going to get us X dollars back.
Trevor F: Okay.
Nathan E: Is that helpful?
Trevor F: Yeah, yeah. I think, you know, I guess to kind of run through some of the things that I had. I mean, customer classification was one of them.
Jenna H: You.
Trevor F: know, segmenting out customers in certain ways either through rfm or using some other data or other machine learning or AI segmentation tools based off of the data, you know, that we have to determine who are high value customers. You know, things like that and assigning some kind of classifier or score to that person. You know, I think that could be a use case and, you know, taking that and trying to apply it into retention marketing efforts. You know, I think could be one project. Another one is like customer retention forecast. So, you know, either based off of that classification or other data, you know, what is the likelihood that, you know, certain customer, any of our customers are going to come back, you know, in a given period ultimately, to… get to a, an overall number of like how many customers from this prior period are going to come back in the future periods which ultimately drive like, okay, can we take that customer number apply, a frequency and a, you know, an aov to get to a top line customer retention forecast? So I think, that could be another use case, on the product side doing some kind of, you know, sentiment analysis or like classification of like return reasons. You know, for example, right? We get all these return reasons by SKU, most of the time and we have general return reasons that are assigned to that return. But, you know, a lot of, the rich data I would say comes in what the customer writes.

Ivan S: So, I know this is just a touch base and I just sent you the information about doma immersions a few minutes ago. Okay. I don't know if you've had a chance to check it and see if you had any questions.
Ed L: I did not have a chance to look at it. I just literally just walked out of another meeting, so.
Ivan S: Okay. No worries.
Ed L: But I did talk to Kevin about it. He was super excited about the idea. So I will take a look at it and get that info over to him, and that should be pretty helpful for us. So.
Ivan S: Perfect. Yeah. In terms of this week, we met with Kevin, we talked about some questions and kind of guided him for his meeting with the nursing department. I don't know if he's been able to give you an update on how that works?
Ed L: No. When was that?
Ivan S: On Tuesday, and I think his call with the nursing department was, or nursing team was on Wednesday?
Ed L: Okay. Yeah. No, I haven't talked to him since then.
Jenna H: Okay. So on Tuesday, you know, we met with him because he had the meeting scheduled with the nursing leadership when we weren't available, unfortunately to help join. So.
Ed L: I kind of gave.
Jenna H: him some questions and directions in terms of how… to take the conversation because what I think we're at with both the falls tracker and the JL dashboard.
Ed L: That.
Jenna H: there's a lot of information in there, but we still don't know how it's being used and kind of surfaced during the call that there's not a ton of login happening and people like viewing these pages and using it. So it's like we need to unwind the ball of yarn and kind of find out like why did they want this? What do they want to do with it? What is missing in it? Like, okay, you have, this dashboard, what do you ultimately want to be able to do with this dashboard? Is it used in monthly reporting? Is it used to make scheduling changes? Is it used to make, you know, staffing level changes? Is it, do we move? Do you move where residents are located based on the types of areas that they maybe fall a lot? Or like I saw there's one resident that's had 21 falls in the past 275 days. Is their room near a nurse's station? Maybe. So, trying to understand more of that. Because where I feel like we're at is a lot of the reporting is delivering the KPIs as requested by the report requester and not fully understanding and it might be the requester not fully understanding either. But like what do you want to do with this after? Because we need to give them a reason to get in there and start looking at things. But it had been, I think for some of them like a month or two since there's been any like real activity outside of the team that we're talking with?
Ed L: So, do you all, you know, whether it's adoption engine or group or whatever? But do you, because Kevin and I did talk about this and, you know, we're not sure. Is it because the product that we delivered isn't useful to them on a database basis or it's only useful to certain people and not others, or are they too busy or, you know, and so, do you guys have an approach that you've kind of refined about trying to figure out why are you not using the tool that we built that you asked us to build or, you know? So what are you guys thinking about related to exploring adoption barriers there?
Jenna H: Yeah. There was, that was some of the like it's more coaching in terms of like questions and asking, not necessarily… is it more about asking open ended questions and trying to… get the end user to say what they want. And sometimes they realize that like they asked for this thinking, they're going to get this beautiful dashboard that's going to solve all the world's problems.
Ivan S: But,
Jenna H: then they get it and it's everything they asked for, but they don't know what to do with it. And then they don't want to like say, I don't know what to do with this. They don't so, what? Like I was looking through the falls tracker?
Ed L: Yup.
Jenna H: Like there's a ton of information on there, which is great, but there's nothing connecting the dots for me as like an end user. And I'm assuming something very similar is happening for nursing leadership that's using it. It's like I have all these static points like these teams have these falls happen with these residents, but nothing is saying, hey, you might want, we might need to look at this list of residents or this nursing team on these days and these hours cause it's all like, oh, you need to look at day of the week time period location?
Ed L: Time. So, so let me, thank you. I think that's helpful. So, I think I hear you saying is that they have a dashboard that's full of data but not actionable information. There's no. So what there or there's no, you know, this is why they're looking at a lot of what's happening but not why is it happening, or what do I need to go do with what is happening? Is that what I'm hearing? We've got data but not actionable insights.
Scott T: Yeah. So kind of where I lean it towards is what you have is kind of like you have reports, right? You have reports that are providing a lot of detail about what's happened, exactly like you said, and sometimes like that is a requirement, right? A lot of people like you have to report out on what these things are. So you probably need dashboards exactly like you've got them built. But in terms of like day to day, what is this impact to it? Like a nurse on shift today? And what value can we drive a nursing manager today, right? A report about what happened last week or last month doesn't do a lot to surface actionable insights there. So sometimes like having two similar dashboards that are both speaking to the same thing, one being more report focused and one being more action focused, right?

Apex is experiencing data pipeline slowdowns due to issues with their data warehouse and ERP system, but Domo usage is growing internally. Domo offered support for the CTOO onboarding and future platform migrations, particularly to Snowflake, as Apex considers changing their ERP system.
","Jake W: hey, Brian. How's it going? Doing good? How about yourself? Doing well, thanks. Hey, Spencer. Hey.
Spencer M: Jake.
Jake W: How's it going?
Spencer M: It's been going pretty good. Been a little bit busy lately but not too bad. Oh,
Jake W: that's great. Are you thinking about who's going to join?
Spencer M: I think this will probably be it from our side. We had one of our processes go wrong overnight and so we have Kyle and… some other people that we might not really join, going through that and looking at that. So we're… just giving you an update on our ctoc situation. He's slowly getting ramped up and wasn't quite. We haven't had time to introduce and go through Domo product yet internally, but still on our roadmap of things to get done, just making sure that he gets set up. I think, I remember telling you that he had to move back to the United States. So he's been working different hours and just slowly piecing things together. But I think he's finally settled and starting to visit all the different offices we have around the United States just to get a feel for the scale and the scope and where everything's at. So we're slowly on the roadmap of all the tools he has to learn.
Jake W: Yeah. And if it makes sense, we'd love to support you with that. So if there's like a chance that we can join a meeting because I know, of course, you guys are, you know, very knowledgeable around Domo but we could come and help more on like, hey here's like our roadmap going forward, maybe talk about some of the solutions that you're not using currently just to, you know, it's in our best interest to kind of show him all of Domo just so that he's familiar with other things. So if that becomes like where you think valuable, you know, we'd love to be a part of it at some level when that makes sense.
Spencer M: Yeah. And it'd be when we get a chance there, it'd be useful to know for what other bi tool he's used in the past so we can have some conversations around similarities and differences and just kind of get him ramped up quicker. And like you said, there's plenty in the product we use, but plenty that we're not. And so giving him the full picture of capabilities would be really helpful so that we continue to utilize everything.
Jake W: Yeah, absolutely. So yeah, keep us kind of posted on that. And then just like from my perspective, it seems like we're a little bit still in a holding pattern until, you know, everything kind of gets settled down. And in fact, I met with Jenna and her team and they were kind of like, hey, we want to do a little bit of a pause because they felt like they were kind of pushing and, you know, the timing just wasn't great. So we're sorry.
Spencer M: We're almost ready to re, engage with them. We've had some topics come up fairly recently about starting to stand up a C level dashboard at least with accounting data. And once we get further in that, I think that's a good project that we can loop in that team to help work with the various people on our side just to kind of figure out who and what needs to be involved.
Jake W: Yeah, I think that would be great. And that team has resources to bring in like some of our financial subject matter experts, you know, and to kind of give that guidance. So just know like, of course, they're still excited, but they also just want to make sure timing's right? So they were just like, hey, let us know and we understand it's outside of everybody's control and it's just disease or what happened when leadership changes. So kind of from our end, we're just like, okay, we're ready to help when you are, we want to support, you know, any type of things that'll be beneficial like, you know, kind of showing all of Domo to your leader, whatever makes sense. But, you know, other than that, like we're of course, we're always a resource, but we're all kind of like thinking we'll just step back and we'll let you guys take lead on when we can help.
Spencer M: Yeah, I think that's the situation. And Brian, unless you see or feel different, I think we are just waiting to see kind of what's next for Domo. We're just building with what we have.
Jake W: Yeah, I would agree with that.
Spencer M: So,
Jake W: yeah. And as far as like Domo itself, is there anything that you need? I, you know, I get a couple of requests here and there to try to enable things and, you know, we, but is there anything else like how's I guess going, it sounds like, you know, you're kind of doing well with what you have. But is there anything that I can help with or, you know, anything that is slowing you down in Domo?
Spencer M: I want to, all… right. So the things that are slowing us down are our data pipeline before we get to Domo. So we… just processes in our data warehouse are we have some failures that happen occasionally and so that's causes that it reflects poorly like people come to Domo. But as far as actual Domo, I think Brian, I haven't seen anything or any requests where we're like, hey, this is slowing us down.
Jake W: And your data warehouse is that, do you, I can't remember, do you guys use a CDW?
Spencer M: So it's a mix of an on Prem SQL and cloud SQL. So we're pulling from two different places but we have… a, what they do is if there's a report that needs to be used in more places than just Domo, then we pull that data and store it on our SQL warehouse. And then if not, then I'm using jupyter workspaces to build a connection to it. But from our ERP system, dell tech vantage point, they have a lot of custom processes that they have that run nightly. And the only data feed we get to Domo runs from dvp to our data warehouse, then up to Domo. And there's some consistent issues that happen in that sync between dvp and our SQL server that causes it. So that there's data not getting correctly pushed to Domo. So that's like the big challenge that our data analytics team has is the data pipeline to Domo part. Brian and I have been keeping up pretty well with the tools inside of Domo and we… I think we told you, but we ramped up a brand new department within the last two weeks to get some of their data Domo and they're making it company wide.

Kolmac is seeking a significant price reduction, and Domo is exploring options to lower the spend, though this may require Kolmac to rebuild their existing Domo setup. The final decision rests with Eric from Kolmac, and Domo has offered further assistance to ensure Kolmac maximizes the value of their Domo investment if they choose to renew.

Abraham M: I'm good. How are you?
Justin L: Good. Ben will be here in just a few minutes. Oh, there he is. What's up, Ben?
Benjamin P: Hello. Sorry, I was just getting off another call. Hey, Abraham. Hey, Ben, how are you guys doing today?
Abraham M: I'm doing well.
Justin L: Awesome week is flying by.
Benjamin P: Ankit. Is this everyone?
Justin L: Everyone on our side, Abraham, I don't know if we'll.
Abraham M: give him a couple of minutes. Greg may be joining… potentially, Eric… yeah.
Justin L: Those are the only folks we'd be waiting for yep.
Benjamin P: So, Abraham, are you approaching what like two months now?
Abraham M: Yeah.
Benjamin P: How are things going?
Abraham M: It's going well. It's a lot to do though. Yeah, it's a lot to do. Yeah, you know, we have an outsourced model on the it side. So, we kind… of struggled through with MSP and everything. But, yeah.
Benjamin P: So, what's your background? So, where were you coming from?
Abraham M: So, I come from pharma and bio… last organization was a manufacturing organization and manufacturing T cells. So, our T cells and going through the process of taking out the T cells from a human, bringing them on site, re, engineering them, making sure they were enough to be re administered back into the individual and then scheduling the infusion. So it's pretty cool. Definitely, we rely on data quite a bit. And so that's my background on before coming here to kolmac.
Benjamin P: Well, that's really interesting. I would, that's something you don't hear? I don't hear that very often. So that's a, sounds like an interesting. And I could see where data would obviously be a very critical for that line of work. So.
Abraham M: Yeah, yeah, absolutely. And in manufacturing, you know, the purpose is to always right? Any company that has a purpose of helping people is to focus on the patient just like here. But bottom line is always king, right? You gotta make sure you're as efficient as you are as you can be, so.
Benjamin P: Yeah. When I was in grad school, one of the, I got my master's in data analytics. And one of the electives that I could have taken was quantitative genomics and that was, I didn't end up taking that one just because I didn't feel like I ever would, you know, work in healthcare and I didn't know, you know, how relevant that was going to be for I have a background in finance and so I was always doing sort of the quantitative analysis on the business and the finance side of things. You know, not so much on the healthcare side of things, but I could see where that class probably would have been really relevant to sort of the type of work that you were in.
Abraham M: Yeah. So a lot of, well, at least for the company that I was coming from, a lot of the efforts were around identifying the potential candidates, right? That may treat a type of cancer that we were kind of building a platform around, but it wasn't a lot on actually hearing it was more identifying. And then a lot of the effort went into testing that hypothesis to see if it actually fanned out. Other organizations are completely different, right? They're more focused on not only identifying but also seeing how they can build on it. But at least the company that I worked for, our main goal was to identify targets and then put them into patients. But, you know, numbers are always true. Science is just so wild.
Benjamin P: Yeah.
Abraham M: This is where technology can get just like far enough, but then once it goes into a human, it's just completely different. I guess it's like the environment that can impact people, the mutations that it may express or not express. It's just, it's a whole different world.
Benjamin P: Yeah.
Abraham M: I don't… know if anybody else is going to show up. So we may end up ending this meeting soon. Frankly, we still haven't signed the, we haven't signed the agreement. I met with Eric this morning. He has a task to call Justin again to just talk through the numbers again. I know that this is part of the value added that… you guys are providing within your renewal. I'm just letting you know that is the status of this engagement at this point. If we do move forward, I'm not sure which way we're going to go. But one of my big concentrations is to looking at that dashboard that you guys created for us and really diving into it and seeing where we can be more efficient and not just looking at where we're spending our credits, but really looking at, hey, this data that you… uploaded in our modeling, is that efficient? You're refreshing it X amount of times and you can accomplish the same results if you just make X y Z change. Because right now, even if I'm looking at the credits that we're spending, even if you are to cut back and just… stay within our allocated standard credits, we're still looking at increasing. significantly year over year and we just got to see if it continues to make sense or not. Here comes Justin. Hey, Justin.
Justin L: Hey, sorry, guys. I was trying to get off another call.
Abraham M: No, no, you're good. I was just telling Ben that last update from Eric is that he's going to be calling you. I'm going to leave it at that, but like I was saying before, he's not really happy as to how things are progressing… and we'll go from there, right? So you may have a completely different approach of how to proceed. I did explain the differences in odds year over year. So if we do move forward with the engagement, what I was telling Ben is that I want to really look at how efficient we are and look at data that we have and how we're refreshing it, how it's being visualized because even if we are able to cut back significantly from 330,000 credits plus a year to 33,000. We're still looking at a significant spend for us and we may… end up in the same situation just later down the road. But right now it's on Eric's hands and he's going to decide how to proceed with the renewal.

Scott T: Morning. How you doing good? How are you? Yeah, doing well. Okay. Thank you.
Martin T: Rama, do you have a specific topic that you want to start off with?
Rama K: Can we discuss that scenario, what we discussed yesterday, Martin, that is the priority, what currently we are doing, right? So that will give you more benefit. How are we going to do that? Sure. Yeah, let's do that then. Okay? So give me one second. Scott. Let me open the links. So, let me sharing my screen, Scott. So let me once you able to see my screen?
Scott T: I don't see it yet.
Rama K: Yeah. Are you able to see my screen?
Scott T: Yes, yep.
Rama K: Okay. The first question, Scott, see this is specifically why I'm asking because you know, right in Domo, the beast mode. So how expensive it is in terms of the performance wise, right? So what's happening here? I will tell you in the background. So there is one dashboard with us. Okay? So the dashboard source, the team has created the domoviewexplorer, so the original source of the data is coming from the databricks using the cloud amplifier. Okay? Top of that one, they have created the domoviewexplorer that domoviewexplorer, they have pointed in the dashboards. So, are you clear until this one, right?
Scott T: Okay.
Rama K: Okay. So now, the big question, what I'm asking is let's say an example, let me filter out that one. So it will give you a better idea. Okay. So these are the beast modes the team has created for that particular domoviewexplorer, you can able to see my screen in the left side. So these are the beast modes it has created. Okay? For example, out of this one, let's say an example to consider the few of the beast modes. So, yeah, for example, this one, the destination country latitude. So if you see the formulas and all this all applicable for the each and every row because it's a case statement, it will go and check for the each and every row, what we have, the source data set likewise for the destination country, longitude, and for getting the invoice month, they just created the date format based on the invoice date, meaning that it's also there for each and every row, likewise, the quarter and year, and month. And also they have the origin country, latitude and origin country, longitude. So now, my question here, so is it the better option to create kind of row by row operation things in the beast mode? Or can we directly do in the view explorer? So how I have created here? If you see here, this is my view in my view itself. I have handled all this case statement like origin country, longitude and whatever I have shown like invoice month, quarter week, date and everything. So which one is the better? So as I read multiple documents in Domo yesterday, so what I came to know, so let me share that also. Let me know. Yeah. So can you see here? This is what I have read finally in the beast mode, right? So when we are querying the first, what happens? It pull the data from the data blix, and it will be there in the Domo cache. And top of that, it will be having the beast mode for my calculation in the memory. Okay? In terms of if I doing the data view explorer, it's directly pushed down to the execute in the database itself. Because there's a cloud amplifier, right? So it will going to execute in the database cluster itself.
Scott T: Yeah.
Rama K: So, kind of scenarios, right? So which one are you guys going to suggest either the beast mode or having into the view explorer itself to calculate the kind of least level granularity for most everything in the view explorer?
Scott T: Yeah. So what I would say is for row by row sort of calculations like this. Like personally, I think best practice is to do it like in an ETL and databricks before you even materialize the view or bring the view over. But if that's not a realistic approach, then doing a row by row calculation in the views explorer like you have here is the second option. The real power behind beast modes is when you're doing something that's aggregating the data or that needs to respond specifically to filters conditions on a page or card as you're looking at it, right? And so if it's row by row calculations, then it'll be more performant if you do it obviously upstream the further upstream you can go. And so the first option would be in databricks itself. The second option would be here as you're bringing the view in. And then the third option would be in beast mode?
Rama K: Does that make sense? Yeah, that's absolutely. I agree. So even, I thought of keeping this one into the databricks but for time being I'm just keeping here. But yes, my main focus to be keeping into the upstream itself because this cooperation can be doable in the upstream itself, right? So, yeah, I agree. Yeah. But my question here… see in the databricks, we have the materialized view. There is nothing kind of ETL and all. Okay. So see there is a, you know, right? We are following the databricks like a metaline meridian structure like bronze and silver and gold. And for, specifically for the Domo or top of the gold, we have created one more layer called the gold analytical layer. Okay. That gold analytical layer depends the data from the gold layer from the databricks. Okay. In the gold analytical layer, the team has created the materialized views, multiple materialized views to fulfill the Domo's or reports needs. Okay. So now, my question here, even though the same query, if I create into the same view, let's say this is a simple select statement. But the simple I'm going to convert this select statement into the materialized view and creating into the gold analytics. Okay.

Brice W: Doing well. It's Monday?
Phil S: Yes. And I know you got a lot of things moving a lot on your plate. So, I appreciate your time.
Brice W: Yeah, we're keeping them all spinning, just kind of running around and touch them up a little bit.
Phil S: That feels like, yeah, what? I, yeah, do the same thing. I'm always like, oh, well, you just move this one a little forward, move that a little forward and then see.
Brice W: What happens? Oh, that one's wobbling, better start hitting that one pretty good.
Phil S: Oh, yeah. Well, yeah, I can, we don't have to take too much time, but I mainly wanted to sync because I know, you know, it's just, it's like a big giant project and all this stuff. I just wanted to kind of catch up and make sure we're all aligned on schedules and, you know, everything that I can do to help support. The first thing I wanted to do to get an update on is just like the PLM project itself. I know that was kind of the thing that's you were going to learn a lot more of like what's in trade beyond versus what's not like any updates there on the overall project?
Brice W: Not a whole lot like they're starting the user acceptance testing in some of the other modules. Nothing that's really has to do with us. Well, I'm sorry, they've established the groups that are going to be doing the testing when it's ready to do the testing with the module. So they're still planning on starting to roll the thing out in January. I think, yeah, we have not had a single meeting yet for our groups like the grouping and all that stuff, the testing side of it. So or I should say that back, we haven't started the groups with the main trade beyond group. They've asked us a bunch of questions. So I think by next month, I think they're going to start getting into some of the details with us. So all that to say it's still, they're still talking like January timeframe just for the flex part of it. For the testing part of it. I went back and watched one of their proposals and it made me think of something that I didn't talk about with your team too much, I don't think and maybe we did, I can't remember if we covered it or not. But it went back to the relationship between the test line and the protocol. Our lab is using a software now where if you write a test line and you add it to a protocol like a test, how you want to test this product today, when you add that test line to that protocol, that relationship between the test line and the protocol are broken. So you can go in and edit whatever you did. You basically just used it for a template.
Phil S: Yeah.
Brice W: So, what has happened with our lab is that it's… not useful at all because you grab that thing, you bring it in and everyone changes it, they just grab the one that was closest to whatever they needed and then go write all their own things in. So there is really no template in that system. You're basically making a new test line every time?
Phil S: Yeah.
Brice W: And so that's the one thing I think whenever we start thinking about that is like the test line database is going to be the source of truth and everything points back to it. If you build a protocol, you can't edit the acceptance criteria in the protocol. If you want to update anything in there, everything has to happen from the test line database. Because for one, we want to be able to track this stuff and be able to mine it and look at trends and things. The other thing is we want the SPS to be able to make a change to one test line and it changes 50 different protocols where if that connection gets broken, you still have to go into each one of those 50 protocols and update everything. Yeah. So that was one thing I don't know if we talked about it or not, but I just went back and watched the one thing from the one review we have with tradebeyond, and that's kind of what we got. But other than that, we haven't had too much conversation on the tradebeyond side. I think they're 100 percent focused on getting flex in there. So I don't know when we'll get to talk about our extra test management system.
Phil S: Yeah. And that's kind of what I mean internally, like as we're talking to people, you know, about the deal and stuff that's what… I'm sure the team is trying to understand is like, well, where, like where… are we… at? As far as like, all right, we know that Domo is going to like augment you know, what's being done or not. And then at what point, like is tradebeyond informed like, hey, we're also working with Domo to like augment this? And would it make sense to, you know, partner right? At that stage to where? Like, hey, if we're you know, going to be part of this, you know, overall solution? Like does it make sense for us to start talking with them now, right? You know, to kind of be in part of the design? That way they're not kind of doing double effort, but I also understand it from like Jose's perspective, your perspective on, well, you know, they're kind of, you know, competing solutions.

He listens anyway. So, and,
Ed L: it's Friday, you know, and it's.
Jenna H: Friday? I was like in the zone on something else. I apologize.
Ed L: Totally get it. Totally get it. No worries.
Jenna H: So, how are you this morning?
Scott T: Don't update outlook today. I got it.
Ed L: Yeah.
Jenna H: Please don't it's not good. It's not fun… especially for me who heavily relies because I try not to go into my inbox calendar too much because then I get distracted by new emails coming in.
Ed L: I rely.
Jenna H: On those updates or those alerts and it just let me down today.
Ed L: But, Ed.
Jenna H: What I heard as I was walking in and eavesdropping about doing extensive analytics and everything. I am loving the sound of this.
Ed L: Yeah. Well, let me just back up for a sec. Well, actually before I go back, I'm not sure what you guys wanted to touch base on today. So let's talk about that first. And then I can kind of fill you in on what was going on in my head.
Jenna H: Actually, what was going on in your head is kind of what we wanted to touch base on… really because we know that you put Kevin in charge to lead this initiative and program, right? But you are like our executive sponsor, you are our Domo champion. Yep. So we wanted to have a conversation with you to make sure that like what the adoption like everything's aligned between like the goals of the adoption engine program and your goals for the future of your organization's Domo instance and how you want your day to day operations to run as well as like the path Kevin is also focused on because Kevin does like he seems very analytical and very report oriented focused and that is a key part of it. But there's also, I loved hearing the words center of excellence. There is that component of it too, and where, what is the art of the possible in terms of your instance? And so that's kind of.
Ed L: Okay.
Jenna H: What we wanted to talk about just as we're finalizing this roadmap plan to present to you just to make sure like we don't show up and show it to you and you're like this is not my vision.
Ed L: Yeah. Okay. No, thank you. So, first of all, thanks for scheduling it. And I appreciate the candor about, you know, the interaction you guys are having with Kevin so far? Kevin's amazing. That dude is a Diamond in the rough.
Jenna H: Yes.
Ed L: And I wanted to give him the opportunity to kind of step in to kind of take in the lead but he's pretty green, you know. And sometimes I forget because I've been doing this for as long as I have in a bunch of different places that there's just stuff that I assume in my head that we're all thinking and pointed in the same direction, but that if I haven't been explicit about it, then we might not all be on the same page. So I'm glad you raised the question and let me know and I'm trying to give him room to run, but it sounds like I also probably need to be a little closer to him in terms of making sure that he's thinking big picture, big vision while he's executing it at sort of an operational level. So, yeah, let's talk a little bit about this. And if you guys need me to write something up, put it on paper. I tend to talk to these things a lot and I'm really lousy at actually writing it down or putting a visual together. And that's one of my personal goals for the year. In terms of skill development. It's more visual evidence of what the heck is in my head. So happy to collaborate with you guys. If you need something visual. After this conversation, let me back up to what I was telling Scott and Ivan before you hopped on, which is that, so we're in the senior living industry obviously. And then we also do healthcare as part of senior living. There's an outfit called ziggler that does a lot of finance and consulting work and whatnot in the senior living and the healthcare space. And they do a CTO report annually about who's investing in, what from a technology perspective. And what struck me as I looked at it this last time was that I think it was about 50 percent of the respondents and I don't remember the sample size. I'd have to go look and see if I can find the sample size are using Power BI. So if you know, the question is, are you doing anything in regards to analytics? And by far the largest share is Power BI. And what, well, the other thing that struck me about it is that 55 percent of the respondents said that they have no plan to address analytics in the next 12 months, which blew my freaking mind… of the single sites campuses like ours where everything's in one site. Currently, only 10 percent of the respondents have any kind of analytics at all. And if you look at the larger sites that have, you know, more like two, three campuses only about 30 percent. Have analytics. So all of that to say is that there's this dearth of nobody's doing analytics, you know, in our industry. And the ones that, are doing power are using Power BI. And I don't know how they're ingesting data and doing ETL and all that kind of stuff. But point being that we want to be sort of a leader in the space in terms of actual analytics, not just saying, hey, how do we do our reporting differently and stick reports into Power BI and make them a little bit easier to access? That's great. You know, it's like Scott said that saves staff time and makes stuff easier. But the reality of our industry is, and I think you heard this part, Jenna, we've got all these disparate data sources that's just always going to be the case. I don't see anybody building an ERP for senior living anytime soon. And the ones that are out there… are sort of compartmentalized, there's nothing that covers the entire range of services. Because if you think about what we do, we've got multiple lines of business, we do healthcare, we do dining, we do maintenance, we do guest services, we do housekeeping, we do facilities management, you know, building and growth and maintenance, all this kind of stuff. We provide it services to our residents. So there's multiple lines of business transportation… and they're all going to work different. You know, there is no one software that brings all that together.

Jenna H: Here it goes. How are you?
Tom H: Doing all right. Doing. All right. It's the first day back in. So lots of catching up to do and you.
Scott T: Made time for us.
Tom H: I think we're going to be good. I accidentally booked off one more day than I was actually going to be out. So I don't have a bunch of meetings they're all falling on tomorrow. So I have today to kind of try and get things settled.
Scott T: That's genius. I'm going to have to start doing that.
Jenna H: I'm going to steal that strategy. Do you know, or Jesse and Liam?
Tom H: Liam can't make it, but Jesse is going to be joining. It. Looks like he just did.
Jenna H: Perfect. So, last week… well, first of all, did you save the mural in your neighborhood? Do we have an update?
Tom H: Yeah. Okay. That's good.
Jenna H: So, last week, we did an app studio working session. We started to introduce app studio and import a page that they had identified into app studio and kind of showed some basic features and functionality in addition to the resource materials. So, I wanted to spend like the first like 10, 15 minutes checking in like with Jesse to see like if he had played around with it anymore, made a copy, things like that. And then the rest of the meeting is going to be for Scott and Alex to do some data architecture talk. And then we're going to have our other meeting that Ivan scheduled with you to kind of talk on those last pieces where we'll be able to put together a full roadmap for you with all of our verified use cases and our plan. So, does that sound good?
Tom H: Yeah, that sounds perfect.
Jenna H: All right. So, Jesse, how are you today?
Jesse P: I'm doing good. I didn't get as much time to play around with it as I wanted to. I did some reading on the links you sent over as far as like how to do things and I'm comfortable. I feel comfortable doing it. I just haven't had the time to start revamping. I had a couple other things that popped up at the end part of last week. So I'm playing on switching things over but I haven't quite gotten there yet.
Jenna H: Yeah, no worries. And that's kind of like something we can keep in the forefront too for us as we're building out this roadmap because we talked a lot about the cool features and functionality that app studio does offer. And so I think we'll just kind of we can keep revisiting app studio and working on this. And as you and Liam really do start to play around with it too, we can start to kind of expand upon that. But I just wanted to have some time up front if you had any questions or if, you know, did some work.
Jesse P: No, no questions. I think that it was really informative last week. So it's something that I definitely want to take advantage of. It's. Just something that hasn't quite had the time the last couple of days. So.
Jenna H: I hear you. No worries. All right. Well, with that, I am going to hand it on over to Scott and Alex and I am unfortunately going to have to drop a little bit early today. Mom duty calls and I've got to get some kids to the dentist.
Jesse P: No.
Tom H: Worries.
Scott T: unbelievable. All right. Yeah. So as Jenna mentioned, we're going to try to cover a little bit more about the back end like what's happening to build out your content where you're getting the data from any challenges there and kind of looking… at your data pipeline and things. I guess my first question is when I look at your instance, I do see quite a bit of different data sources, everything from Salesforce to Pendo workbench, Google ads, all kinds of things. What would you say are your main data sources and kind of what's the use case for each one? If you don't mind?
Tom H: So, I think that I mean, you have to start off saying, you know, Salesforce because that is something that power is reporting across. I want to say more or less every single function in the company outside of maybe talent. But even then I think that there's like some reporting that comes from Salesforce on like course completions. Obviously all sales information comes out of there. Lots of marketing information comes there as leads get created, all support cases, all professional services, projects and milestones, every client asset is stored in Salesforce… contracts are stored in Salesforce… trying to think of other like major entities there. And then there's a lot of like associated like risk records that get stored there's a lot of like change logs that get stored, that kind of feed off of those entities… secondary to that. I would say probably the next biggest is a little bit of a tie between all of the information that's coming from Pendo regarding usage for products. And then a set of data that's coming actually from sharepoint. But sharepoint is just a repo from our devops tool and that's what we use to track the productivity of our scrum teams as they complete stories and defects according to their sprint schedules. So, if you're looking at any of the dashboards that are titled, you know, pto metrics or agile metrics, those all stem from the sharepoint connected tables. The data set you'd be looking for would be like the version one snapshot, the platform used to be called version one. That's why the name is there. It's not like the first version of anything… then I think the next most crazy data source would be some things that come out of, I believe in doma, they're marked odbc connectors that are all of the big open claims data sets. These are the ones that are really massive. We're talking hundreds of millions of records because it's a really granular level of fidelity that gets stored over time.
Scott T: Yeah. Is this, do you pull? Is this getting pulled in via workbench? Or is it like an API script that's pushing it in like a python or R script, you know?
Tom H: So these are… being generated through workbench before workbench builds them. Essentially, there's a sequence of SQL scripts that we push out from like a reporting server",Consumption Pricing Model,250160.05,Corporate,GREENWAYHEALTH.COM,11,Retail,1310,$250M to <$500M,Renewal,Blank,2: Determine Needs,Rob Staples,2026-01-01,2024-01-11,2024-01-11,,,,,,0015000000vr9eVAAQ

How's your morning going, man? Did you go for a run? It's.
Benjamin P: busy. It's busy. No, I ran three Miles last night though.
Ankit S: Oh, okay. You've been doing your runs that night that's actually?
Benjamin P: No, not always. I did last night, but I actually prefer running during the day when it's like nine degrees and blazing outside. That sounds stupid, but I don't know it just feels more productive when I do that. I don't know why, but I will tell you one thing though is I cannot run three Miles in the middle of the day, but I can run three Miles that night when the sun's down. So, during the day, when I run, I can only churn out maybe two Miles at most but it's just because of the heat.
Ankit S: Yeah, I feel the same way about biking.
Benjamin P: Jonathan, you're on mute. I like it to be hot.
Sharr J: Ben, where are you? Again? You're in the south, correct?
Benjamin P: I'm in south Georgia.
Sharr J: Okay. Yeah. So it's hot.
Benjamin P: It's very hot and the humidity is as bad as the heat. So it's like 65, 70 percent humidity, so.
Sharr J: Yeah, we get that. So, in coastal Connecticut. Yeah, we get gross humidity.
Benjamin P: Where?
Ankit S: In Connecticut, are you Jonathan?
Sharr J: Are you familiar with Connecticut?
Ankit S: I'm from jersey, so I know a little bit.
Sharr J: I'm between new haven and new London on the sound.
Ankit S: Are you of the belief that new haven pizza is just unbeatable? Better than New York?
Sharr J: Oh, of course.
Ankit S: Yeah, that's like one of the reasons I really want to go to new haven and just do like a tour of some of those top pizza spots around there.
Sharr J: New haven has great food. Yeah, we'll say.
Benjamin P: Yeah, hi, Jon.
Sharr J: Hey, Jon. Nice to meet you.
Benjamin P: Hey, good morning. Good morning. So, Jon, I want to introduce you to Jonathan at five star. We've been chatting with him for a couple weeks now about some opportunities that we can engage with them on some use cases. And one of the things that came up was labor optimization, which we just got off a call discussing that in a little bit more detail. And so essentially, they have some requirements that they must follow by law in terms of the staffing that's required based on occupancy. But they also want to better manage. Not only do they want to meet those requirements, but they want to also meet the clinical needs that are required for the occupancy that they currently have. But they also don't want to overstaff, right? And so it seems like there's a little bit of a lack of visibility and just their ability to optimize their staffing needs on an ongoing basis. So, Jonathan, did I summarize that well or is there anything additional that you want to add?
Sharr J: No, that's perfect.
Benjamin P: Cool. So trying.
John M: to figure out aligned this to go through my airpods, but it's not working. So I'm going to take these out… and Ben kind of already ramped me on this. So I knew, I know a little bit, but I think the game plan here is I'm going to show you some of the things we've done in the workforce optimization space, if you find it interesting, cool. If it's boring and you're not interested. I'd rather you just tell me, you know, like, I want to show you things that you think are cool and like, maybe, you know, get your wheels turning on different things that demo can do. I don't want to just demo product features to you and have you be like, yeah, got it. You know, what? Like whatever, you know, so that's kind of what success looks like for me. It is, it looks like for me. Okay. So… I'm going to pull this up. Discount tire is the one that we just recently did this with in a big way. We've done it with other retailers. And I would say primarily when we've done workforce management, it has been in the retail space which I know I don't think that you are based on the title of the meeting. Is that a fair assumption?
Sharr J: No, treat us more like healthcare and that's the more the, this is senior living, which is you.
John M: know, hospitality.
Sharr J: Meets healthcare meets housing rental. But really, the labor side is think healthcare is the biggest comparison. But honestly, I, you know, grew up in family run retail. So I, there's a lot of similarities between, you know, retail labor scheduling utilization and healthcare. So, I can, if your dominant use case is retail, I can make that translation in my head and I think there's enough value.
John M: Okay. Yeah. In this particular kind of space with, you know, workforce management, it, I would say it primarily has been retail but it can apply to anything, right? So I just didn't want, I just wanted to kind of be transparent on that. Okay? So here… is what we built and. So, what discount the problem that discount tire was struggling with? And this is what it comes down to is they have, these store managers, right? Who are in charge of their store's profitability. But when you think about a store, there's… only so many levers that they can actually control when it comes to profitability. They, they can't change how many people come in to get a tire change. They can't change what tire people buy, right? Like people usually want, you know, a certain tire or whatever. So, one of the things that a store manager can actually control for the profitability of that store is, are they over or under spending on workforce planning, right? Like do they have too many people or not enough people to service the demand, right? Like that was the problem that discount was struggling with. They were currently or before this tool, they were, they had this large excel sheet that they were sending out to all the store managers. So it had like five different tabs across the bottom and I could pull it up and show you if you're interested, right? But… this large excel sheet and they were sending this excel sheet out to, store managers were like saying, okay, I have five assistant managers. I have three service professionals. I have this many people in the alignment section of the business, right? Like all these different kind of, they were just putting it all into excel.

Benjamin P: Yeah. So, do you keep up with golf very much or not very much?
Jason J: Not much. The most I keep up with golf. And this is probably pretty sad is I'm obviously Cleveland sports through and I listen to the browns or very often, I will listen to the browns daily radio show. They have an in house one. And in the off season, obviously, it gets quite boring. And our Guy that is the kind of personality host on that one and is now the color commentator for the radio calls too is a really good golfer. He's like a two handicap type golfer. So they end up talking about it a bunch. So that's my knowledge of golf comes from my football podcasts. So that's the most, I know. So I'll know some of the bigger names, some of the tournaments that come around. When they start talking about them. I'll hear stuff. They'll kind of give updates of like, okay, this person's here. This person's here, but beyond that, I have no clue.
Benjamin P: Got it. So, how do you feel about shador?
Jason J: I think, I mean, still stuff to learn. I think he looked great though. I mean, that was a hell of a first showing with, very little reps and everything else. I think they put him in a great position to succeed. He showed growth even through the game. I mean, I saw everything I wanted to see first start. I mean, he's not ready. I don't want him starting week one, but there's an NFL quarterback in there.
Benjamin P: Yeah. I think he's I think he's the most capable, with the most long term potential of anybody on that roster with.
Jason J: Long term. Yeah. Right right now, I mean, flacco with the arm that he still has is blowing everybody else out of the water. So, I mean, that's what's going to end up happening. I mean, yeah. Okay. He can't move. He can't do all those kind of things and his gunslinger decision making's meh, every once in a while, but that arm, is real even at this age.
Benjamin P: Well, we had, I don't know if you recall, I'm a colts fan. And so, we had him for a year.
Jason J: Last year. Yeah. But that's a wrong offense for him. I mean, you're trying to do Anthony richardson and, that's that looks to be a big swing and a miss too, but you build a, and you've got a good offensive coordinator. So, it's not even that but, I mean, very creative, very, like cutting edge offensive coordinator, and for him to not be able to pull more out of richardson just because of how, I mean, when you talk about a 50 50 ball in the NFL, it's because there's a quarterback and a receiver out there, not because it might have a 50 percent chance of getting there. That's what you got with richardson.
Benjamin P: Yeah.
Jason J: So, but then you, throw flacco into, I mean, flacco succeeded for us coming off the couch because the pin pull gap, wide west coast offense that we're running is almost what he was running in Baltimore for friggin' 15 years. So, he was very familiar with it. You were trying to run a, a wider, spread rpo offense. Yeah, there, which, I mean, the dude's 40 years old. He ain't running nowhere.
Benjamin P: That's right. Yeah, it's, it'll be interesting. I hope that they are, I hope he matures and progresses some, but, I will say, I mean, it was only one game, so, it's hard to really measure, but I really thought Riley Leonard played better than, the, of the three quarterbacks that played in the first preseason game for the colts, I think Riley Leonard looked really good.
Jason J: That would not surprise me because the other two are Anthony richardson and Daniel jones. So, I mean, sorry to say, but it's not a high bar. I mean, now, I do think it's funny where we would have preferred taking Daniel jones over Kenny Pickett as the reclamation project and Daniel jones said no and wanted to go there. It was like, okay, I don't know that was the best option for you, but have fun with that. Yeah, it's not going to be a good year for the colts. So.
Benjamin P: Good deal. Well, yeah. So let's do any updates on the data side?
Jason J: The update is basically you're up next. I'll probably have something for you next week. I'll show… you where we're at with our, I threw this together to let them see it a little bit more all in one spot, but that's where we're at right now with the original dynamic recovery, but that's all time… and then the new, the recycling where we're like 23 days. Now, you can see the last two are almost nothing where we're 5,000,000 of new cost that's added. And with the payments that have been made, we're up to 807 K in less than a month so far. So that's amazing. Yeah, great story there. But so I threw that on just one spot. So, a lot of it, so I could even look at it easier. But my next step is okay. I'll actually start putting together the data sets for dynamic pricing V to, so you're coming next, it's there was a possibility that I'd have it started yesterday, but I didn't get to it. So.
Benjamin P: Yeah, that's fine. I just, I'm kind of just checking on, see how it's going. So, yeah, that's.
Jason J: great. We're right there now. So it's like I got everything else, tied up now, I think so, I can get that together.
Benjamin P: All right. Cool. Yeah, I, I saw this, set, let's see if, I can find it here. So, due to when the hours expire, I was, I set this to hopefully have this complete in October. It's August. So that gives us two full months so.
Jason J: I think we'll be fine. Yeah.
Benjamin P: Given the, given the data's ready here in the next couple weeks, I think that gives us plenty of enough time to execute, on what we were hoping for. So, yeah.

How's it going?
Nate T: Not too bad reporting for coaching purposes.
Simon N: Yeah, it's funny. All of our, I need to get, I need some coaching of course, to start with, but all of our zoom calls are typically recorded. But I was recently given a Microsoft copilot license to test out. And so I've transitioned to teams and for whatever reason, it now like gives that audio prompt even though everything's been recorded previously. It like makes me more aware. I'm like, yeah, it is recorded.
Nate T: Yeah, it reminds me I worked at eBay for a long time as an account manager and we had to say that whenever someone called us and I hated it like just, I… don't know, I would be like call me on my cell phone. Don't call me on my work phone, but, yeah.
Simon N: It's interesting.
Nate T: For some reason having to say that, I don't know it made to me, it's like we're an account manager. We're not like a customer service group. So anyways,
Simon N: yeah, that is interesting if you actually have to like if it's like the actual person like starting the conversation like before it's like, hey, how's it going? Being like, hey, this is called being recorded. Yeah, it like changes the interaction a little bit. Yeah. I was just like assume, I guess I'm always under the assumption I'm like always being recorded just because all of our work stuff is so like whenever I talk to like, you know, the bank or the business, I'm just like I'm assuming that this is being transcribed and stored somewhere. So, you know, I feel my best behavior.
Nate T: Yeah.
Simon N: How's the fall been going out in Utah? Is it like cooling down or is it still summer or mixed bag?
Nate T: It's been a mixed bag. It's been like the last couple of days have been cool, which I like, but I don't want to miss like the nice seventies weather and it feels like it was like the seventies for like a week. And now it's dropped down just kind of comes with the territory. I guess.
Simon N: Yeah, like winter in the morning, summer in the afternoon. Still, yeah. Is there any snow in the wasatch, has that front range? Gotten any dusting?
Nate T: Yeah, we got like a pretty decent size storm just last week or a few days ago. And so it's pretty cool right now. Like it's you know, relatively warm outside, but we've got snow up top in the mountains. So it looks pretty.
Simon N: Yeah, I'm sure it'd be cool to get over to park city and do a little mountain biking. I'm sure they get all the foliage and the colors changing and whatnot. Yeah, the color?
Nate T: Change is pretty awesome.
Simon N: I saw Chris jumped on. All right. Well, kind of what we're thinking for the call today is we're going to kind of build on the discussion last week around the training options and all Zach kind of lead out on going through what that would look like in terms of those private training sessions for your use groups. And then after that, we can kind of shift gears and discuss the renewal a little bit. Doug and I were able to get together between our last call and now and we have kind of some questions and some general things we want to align on kind of before actually putting numbers to paper and saying, hey here's, an option, maybe get a better understanding of a couple of items. So that's something like a fair agenda for the call today.
Zack C: Yeah, my word.
Simon N: Perfect. All right. Well, Zach, I'll hand the baton to you here to start and walk through the training.
Zack C: Yeah, for sure. Maybe before I get too far into that, has there been any change to what we discussed previously, as far as we talked about consumer training, we talked about content creation, rough numbers. You know, when we talk consumer, we're talking three to 500 participants at the time content creation. I think we were a little, we were still figuring some of that out a little bit but wanted to see if there's any changes in that we talked about previously that I can take into account as we're discussing options. Yeah, no changes. All right. Okay. Sounds good. So as far as the options for the consumer side of things with that three to 500 users that would want to set up there, my recommendation for that is that we would set up multiple virtual sessions that would help us to teach that navigating piece of it and consuming piece of it. And I would recommend that we'd probably be looking at three to four sessions for that with that many people. Just so that there's room for Q a in there that's not going to be unwieldy. If, you know, we have 500 people in one session or something like that. But if we have somewhere around, you know, 100 people in a session, we can still have some of that monitored and matched Q a on there. And so we'd be looking at four probably four virtual sessions that we could spread out to make sure we get different times and days of the week that would be accessible for members of the team. And that could be over a couple week period or, you know, whatever makes the most sense there. Those don't have to be back to back. I just make sure to work with you to find appropriate options to get the most of the team able to come and participate there. And then as far as the content creation piece, my recommendation would be depending on the numbers that we're looking at, probably two bootcamp sessions on creating content or visualization. Those are three hour trainings that are hands on trainings. And so we'd have a smaller subset of people there and those we're talking about, you're talking about 15 to 20. I think we discussed that a little bit before people would be the max in those. But then we can have some of those people who are going to be actually going into the editing and creation of content, get hands on training in those virtual bootcamp sessions there. So we were talking about second half of November, potential follow up early December. Is that still the timetable that we were thinking about here as well or has anything changed as far as timetable?
Chris W: No, that's all the same.
Zack C: Okay. Tell me your thoughts so far on these options that we're outlining here.

So, I'm not going to show my video.
Signe P: Yeah. You're like on my fold.
Randy B: I gotcha. I told you… I made Sharon a co host since for some reason, I couldn't make you co hosts.
Signe P: Am I already?
Dan P: A co host? Hi?
Signe P: We're going to keep Randy on mute. I think he's underwater.
Sharon A: Okay.
Signe P: I can't hear him very well. Dan, did I read that there are more people coming, right? I think you're the only one that accepted.
Dan P: I think so… we can get started without them as they join. But I can sort of speak on behalf of my team. So I wanted to kind of get started. We had a few internal meetings in between now and the last meeting that we had. And I kind of want to like reset what problem we're solving here. I know originally, we were very concerned about, you know, swapping out Salesforce connectors with databricks connectors et cetera. Blah blah blah as we dove into the actual consumption usage data set, we sort of learned that 90 percent of our credits are just from having data flows trigger all the time and doing some napkin math. We sort of determined it looks like if we just turned everything down to run once a day max, like not even on weekends, like we could probably reduce our credit usage by around like 70 or 80 percent, right? So what I wanted to use this time with you all for, and I apologize for any of the databricks specialists on the call because I don't know how much we need you. I want to make sure I'm understanding our contract for credit usage next year a little more clearly because if I'm reading it the way I understand it, I don't think we have that big of a concern of staying under our credit budget by simply just having better trigger rules on our data flows. But the contract was a little confusing to me on like what is the actual yearly credits we're allotted next year and the year after? So I wanted to kind of just start there. And then I think for as far as like what will we do this year before the re tag? Like what's most important? I think the main thing that Neil highlighted Neil on our side is on the fintech side you guys are familiar with? He was thinking, we just mostly want to use the help of Greg to set up a lot of governance stuff to just stay on top of things next year. But we're not as concerned with doing any major changes or cleanup this year. So I wanted to pause there and see if that would be a good use of our time. I know it's a bit of a pivot from at least the meeting title of databricks migration. So I wanted to pause there.
Signe P: Yeah. So for the team on the call, they are helping with that migration, is there going to be any need for migration assistance? Or is that not going to be the play for this year? And you feel after the re tag because it's overage. Is it overages or re tag? But at the end of the year, when you have that mark of saying, OK, now everything counts. Is there any worry or risk about moving things around or changing things up after that date?
Dan P: That's the main question that we have is one thing that would make it very easy is if we know at some point next year, we don't know if it's going to be January or June or Q4 of next year. At some point, we will probably swap out Salesforce connectors S, three connectors for databricks connectors. It'll be functionally the exact same use case of the data, same amount of data it's just going to be a direct swap. So, what we're asking is we don't have the bandwidth to swap those out before this re tag. So we're just asking, is it okay to what process would you guys prefer we do to make it clear this is not actually new data. We're just swapping the way we're getting it. So, I know we had brought up in the last call setting up dummy connectors. You just say, all right, we know that these 12 Salesforce connectors eventually will be databricks connectors. Let's just set up 12 databricks connectors. And when we finally have it all the code set up, we'll make the swap, it'll be a new data set id. We want to make sure we're not charged for it. So that was kind of the main thing. And I saw in the contract there was some special terms sort of around like, hey, we want to make sure you guys are being in good faith and not like taking legacy data and completely repurposing it. So I wanted to make sure the opposite of that when we are bringing in new data and it is the exact same as legacy. I also want to make sure we're not getting charged extra for it. So, my main question is like if you guys are okay with the like setting up the dummy connectors, we'll spend our time this year setting those up. We'll kind of let you know here are the 50 or 60 or so input connectors or import connectors, whatever we want to call them that we think will eventually be swapped out with a different method. But there's no way we have the bandwidth to actually do it. And I don't think it makes sense to pull your team in to like help us do that. Yeah. So I'll stop there. Does that make sense?
Signe P: Yeah, Sharon, I don't know if you have best practices around that or what that looks like or how we can make sure that we distinguish between, you know, the legacy and what's new, especially if they create the dummy connectors, do you have any input on that?
Sharon A: I'm assuming we would just need to tag those back as legacy.
Dan P: Well, if we created the dummy connectors this year, they would just be tagged as legacy, right? And then we would delete the old ones but that feels like kind of a silly way to do it. Would you guys prefer we just tell you fyi, this is the same. Can you guys tag it as legacy like that's? Sort of the question. I was happy to do that work if the other method is more complicated on your end, but I want to make it very clear like we are following like the spirit of the contract. We're not trying to game the system. These are just these weird swaps that we don't know when we're going to make them and we just want to make sure they don't count towards our credits.
Sharon A: Yeah. So in that case, I would say, you know, follow our normal tagging process, right?

The group agreed to further investigate the feasibility of setting up a new Domo instance or implementing notifications to track data access, with the goal of finding a solution that meets Enveda's requirements by the end of September.","Scott B: hey, Andrew.
Andrew K: Scott, how's it going?
Scott B: Great. Hi, shailaja.
Shailaja G: Hi, both of you. How are you?
Scott B: Doing good, pretty.
Andrew K: Well, I have a new webcam that I literally just put up. So there's an 80 percent chance you guys are going to fall off at some point. So, if that happens, that's why?
Scott B: Okay. No problem.
Andrew K: All right. So, I don't know whether you, did you get my like context about the situation Scott?
Scott B: I've been on calls all day. So, if you sent it today, I haven't seen it.
Andrew K: I sent it previously but it's not a big deal. We can recap it. Yeah.
Shailaja G: We can recap and, hopefully Robert's joining, but I think we can get started, because I do have to drop at the top of the hour. So Scott, you met Andrew. Now, Andrew helps us with employee engagement surveys and, obviously, we try to keep it anonymous, right? We don't want to see the data and that's why Andrew does all the analysis for us and gives us insights. But we want to obviously make those insights available to our people leaders, because just having those insights and HR reading it doesn't make sense. We want to take our people leaders to take action. That's the big idea so far. Andrew has done that in tableau, but we want to bring those insights into Domo because we have chosen Domo as our platform to do all the bi, work and everything else that, you know, about… today. You know, we have two instances, one for HR, one for it, and we're hoping that Andrew somehow can build this analysis in the HR instance without us having to spin off another one for those reasons, keeping that second option aside like, hey, there's always, we can spin off another instance, keeping that option aside. What can we do today? One of the things that I mentioned to Andrew is, hey, can we anonymize the data? Just the employee data that Robert and I as admins would not be able to see it, but then Andrew has reservations about that, so he wants to propose another one solution. And I don't know if it is even feasible. But Andrew having said that, take it away.
Andrew K: Okay. Yeah. So that was a pretty good recap. Essentially, there's two levels of people who are going to be using the dashboards. It's going to be the managers at enveda, who are not admins within Domo. The second category of people are shailaja and Robert, and maybe there's one other person doesn't really matter how many, but they're admins, and obviously HR.
Shailaja G: Team, you can call it HR team as another cohort.
Andrew K: Okay. Yeah. And so I've got no apprehensions about them as people. They're not going to spend their time really trying to find who said what, and be vindictive or something. But regardless of intentions, the anonymity guarantee is still something that we want to establish to the best that we can. And like shailaja said, we don't want to have to set up another instance. And my concern is that as admins, if we connect the data through just like a data upload, and this is my first time using Domo too, so I'm probably off of some of the nomenclature, but the Domo file upload method is once it's in Domo, obviously an admin is going to be able to access it. So in my mind that rules out that option as the data pathway. The other one that seemed to make sense would be using what I think you guys call a connector which can be to various third party platforms and that would be through Google sheets for us most likely. And I guess the main question is if I use my Google sheets and I connect it through Domo, will other admins like shailaja and Robert be able to access the data because they are admins, or is there a way that we can because it's in my Google sheets that's private because they don't have those login credentials that I can essentially block them from it despite them being admins.
Scott B: Okay. Great question. So the way that it works with connectors is with our Google sheet connector, we materialize the rows from whatever it is that we pull. So we actually make a duplication of the data set in Domo, which admins have full access to… admins, have access to any data that is materialized in Domo?
Andrew K: Okay. So the connector is really just doing the file method?
Scott B: Yeah. So the connector, it doesn't matter if I own a Salesforce credentials and some other user owns Hubspot credentials. I can't access that user's Hubspot because I don't have the credentials to do it. But when it's brought into Domo, if I'm an admin, I can see it because it makes a copy of the data in Domo. Got it admin in Domo.
Andrew K: And so it does because I'm guessing this isn't the case for our survey, but there's a refresh, you know, rate that some companies, you know, they're getting live fed data that they need to update in those instances? Is Domo, just refreshing that copying of the data at whatever frequency it's not actually pulling the live data. It's just duplicating it and then syncing it in Domo.
Scott B: So, for Google sheets, it would just be a duplication of, we do have other tools that we can make like a virtualized like a virtualized federated connection to like a snowflake or bigquery where we can actually make a live like a live look that makes a query too, right? Yeah. So we have, that we could do. But the, when it comes to Google sheets and some of the options that you mentioned, it actually does materialize those rows with the Domo, it makes a copy of it.
Andrew K: Okay. I guess given that, I mean, I think it's hopefully kind of clear like what the objective is here that we're trying to do is prevent admins from being able to access the underlying data. The dashboard is going to be set up to only reveal data for groups of larger than five people. So no matter what demographic filters are selected, if it's less than five people, it'll just essentially be blank and that takes care of the other managers being able to access the data on an individual level. But admins, sounds like there's not really a way to prevent them from accessing the data.
Scott B: Correct.
Andrew K: Can you think of one that?
Scott B: No, if the data is stored in Domo, then it's accessible by an admi",Consumption Pricing Model,28000.0,Corporate,ENVEDABIO.COM,2,Life Sciences,1,$10M to <$25M,,,,,,,,,,,,,001Vq0000021RTFIA2

WAYNE W: Have, yeah, no, appreciate it. Glad you asked, yes, and I'll even just kind of give you guys a little if you don't mind, I'll share my screen here. Perfect. Let's see. I got a first. So we're usually on teams. Okay? I'm probably got to remember which you.
Ron K: Got to share that right? Screen. Yeah, exactly. Let's.
WAYNE W: see. So, let's see this presentation.
Ron K: Is that your primary video tool? You guys?
WAYNE W: Are teams first? Yeah, we can switch.
Michael D: I'll switch over the me and invite to teams to our future ones going forward?
WAYNE W: No, I mean, you know, I mean, we just have to, that's fine. I just have to kind of keep in mind. Okay, which one am I on here? Let's see. Okay. So, I think.
Michael D: Do that now.
William M: Actually.
WAYNE W: Okay. All right. Can you guys kind of see my powerpoint here? Yep. Good. Okay. So honestly… just kind of back up. We're going full. So… you know, myself, leading, of course, the Domo also inside sales, Wendy kraminski, my colleague who runs kind of the Salesforce group proexchange, which is basically our own.
Ron K: Portal.
WAYNE W: App if you will, for our customers to be able to, you know, interact place orders, view, you know, view stock, you know, all those kind of great things you can do online. So we basically had to present to the organization about where we're going on sales technology. You know, what's coming ahead. You know, again this is a more not kind of a status of where we are today, but just kind of more strategic of where we're going. And so I had the opportunity to meet or, you know, to present. And now the first part was Wendy's piece on, you know, we're looking to expand B to B. QB is kind of our, you know, we have this big thing on innovation automation to improve productivity. So we're trying to, you know, automate orders if you will. We have a lot of people we have for example, today got the stats, you know, we keep in Domo, 83 percent of our orders are manually keyed today. So that sounds like a lot, right? But just two years ago, that was 97 percent. So we are quickly moving to get off of the day to day people keying every order, every po that comes in from a customer, right? We want to automate that. We want to be able for it to put it into what's called QB and it reads it and then automatically puts it into our point of sale system to create an order, right? To eliminate the, you know, monotonous keying of orders all day long, right? Salesforce, of course, is our CRM pretty extensively there. As I mentioned, proexchange which is, you know, our customer portal, it's done through Salesforce. So all this technology you're seeing here is really driven on the Salesforce side… moving into my realm… you know, inside sales. Big component for me. We're growing… see, I mean we're going to hit 103,000,000 this year. So, this is my other hat. My other big hat that I wear is managing this group. So we're going to be continuing to expand, you know, our team and inside sales. What we do is really focus on the small customers. You know, we have field reps outside, you know, that are calling on our larger customers. We find that our smaller customers kind of get missed, you know, kind of lost in the shuffle because they're just so focused on our larger customers that's where my team comes into play. We get in touch with those customers, phone email, any way we possibly can to just try to make sure the customer knows, you know, we're still thinking about them connected. Talk about promotion that we're running specials. Make sure they're aware of the loyalty program that we have and those kinds of things been a, huge success, double digit growth every year. And the idea is we're going to continue to expand. So, so busy time there then moving to Domo, you know, this is where we're getting into more, you know, the data science realm. Maybe it's more could be more financial modeling. But nonetheless, I want to build some forecasting to look ahead. You know, my point was we do, we've got eight years of data. Fantastic.

Bellamy Y: Hey, Ben.
Benjamin P: How you doing?
Bellamy Y: Good kind of excited.
Benjamin P: I hope everything's okay?
Bellamy Y: Yes, things are going. I'm a little excited to show you something… excited.
Benjamin P: To see it.
Bellamy Y: Yeah, I don't know what you got in store for us, but we have something for you guys. Okay. Should we get started right away or are we expecting anyone else?
Benjamin P: Yeah. So, I think we've probably got, everybody, one of the things I did want to discuss, well, I plan on discussing it tomorrow because our original meeting was scheduled for tomorrow, but it's more of a formality than anything part of this adoption, program is to, we went through the roadmap, right? But to basically, have our scoping team put together a scope and then just, you basically approve the scope that we've discussed. And like I said, that's more of a formality than anything, on our side. And so that's not ready yet. He was gonna have it ready today and we were gonna meet on it tomorrow. So, we'll just meet on it next week. So it's we won't have to, we won't be discussing that today, but I just wanted, to just surface that. So, you, so you'll know that's gonna be coming. So.
Bellamy Y: Okay. Thank you. Yeah, I think we have something on Monday, so, cool. We should be good. Okay, do you think I could share my screen?
Benjamin P: Yeah, absolutely.
Bellamy Y: Okay. Ziba and I last week and we're so like giddy about this because we actually went into the app studio and figured things out ourselves a little bit, but we still have some questions around. So, we wanted to build a, customer report on a monthly customer report that we kind of want to share on a monthly basis. There's pump data in range right now with those two, but we made it and we were able to put our cars in here and make it interactive and whatnot, so super proud about that, but more… than that and being able to make these tabs was super fun. We have questions. So, like number one, how can we do drill downs in app studio if we were to have like Qlik onto it, you know, or do we need to have like a button?
Benjamin P: Yep. So, if you, does this card have a drill path already?
Bellamy Y: Ziba, which one has, yes.
Z S: The, they should have drill paths. The, I don't think these pivot tables do, but everything else should like this. This one should, and we actually, we were trying to figure out how to make them work on the app.
Benjamin P: Yep. Got it. Okay. So, if you go to the little edit button at the bottom, so the three, three dots at the bottom details, and then you go to edit.
Bellamy Y: Huh.
Benjamin P: And then Qlik on that card, huh. And then go to actions and then in it and then go to the enable interactive filters, oh, and do drill in place.
Bellamy Y: Oh, and then.
Benjamin P: save. And so now, when you Qlik on, it should drill, oh,
Bellamy Y: sick. Yep, great. Amazing. Ziba, you heard that we need to do that?
Z S: Yep.
Benjamin P: It's at an individual card level because some people may want a card to filter the entire page or they may want one to just drill in place. So it's per card.
Bellamy Y: Great. Okay. So, we're definitely going to use this more questions. So, if we were… if I look into this edit app, what I noticed is that the length of each tab must be equidistant with every other tab. Is that true? Yes, that.
Benjamin P: Is true. They're all the same height?
Bellamy Y: How do people manage this long stuff? How do I make this smaller?
Benjamin P: Yep. So go to the plus sign on the left and you see the one that says, spacer, ooh, you can just add a white space in there and then make the white space bigger.
Bellamy Y: Oh, I didn't really?
Z S: Think, oh, yeah, I think I added those for some.
Bellamy Y: Oh, yeah.
Z S: That was useful.
Benjamin P: Yeah. Oh, I.
Bellamy Y: had no idea.
Z S: Maybe not on this page, but.
Bellamy Y: Okay, great. Okay. Good, good. Okay. Hold on. Yeah, no, this is sick. Okay, great. Where are some other? I think those are the only two I had on this one. Do people like add filter cards on here? You can do whatever you want, right? Really.
Benjamin P: Yep. So you can do, so… you can do filters within the tabs if you just want it to filter those cards, you can also do filters outside of the tabs, if you want it to filter all of the tabs at one time.
Bellamy Y: Oh, okay.
Benjamin P: And you can even have filters because you just have one page in this app, but you have multiple tabs, you can even have filters that filter across the pages if you want to.
Bellamy Y: Oh, could you walk me through all those cases really quick. Yes.
Benjamin P: Yep. So, well… let's save it first. Okay? And so one thing we can do is just go to controls. And because a filter card essentially just manipulates this panel here. So if you just Qlik on one of those to use as a filter, it doesn't matter which one it's just to demonstrate how the filtering works.
Bellamy Y: I'm going to choose a good one. It is weekday, all right.
Benjamin P: And then, yeah, and you… can just Qlik, yeah, and then apply and so save. So if you had a filter on your, you… don't have to create a filter view, just cancel. Oh, yeah. So you don't have to Qlik save that's just if you want to save that as a filter. So it's already filtered. So you see the little white, the blue circle with the one on the left side that shows that currently that page is being filtered. So if you look at all the cards and you see the ones that have a little. So you can just, you can X out of the controls panel to get it out of the way.
Bellamy Y: Oh, I see. And.
Benjamin P: If you scroll down to one, so that card right there is being filtered because it has that column in the dataset. And so we'll add a filter card in just a moment, but it's essentially going to do this exact same thing. Now, if you scroll to the top and go to another tab.
Bellamy Y: Yes.
Benjamin P: Those should also be filtered as long as that column exists in the dataset that's powering this card.

Katie O: Hey, Tim, how are you? I'm.
Tim K: good. How about?
Katie O: You? Good? Seems like everybody's kind of running a few minutes late today. I haven't seen anything from Justin, so I assume he'll be here.
Tim K: Whoopsie. We extend this because to primarily go through his feedback, is that right?
Katie O: Yeah, because we were going to do an hour last Friday, so I wanted to make sure that we at least had enough time if he gets done with his feedback quickly. Great. If not, that's okay, too. We've got the extra session.
Tim K: Okay. So maybe we want to do whatever Kyle has if there's any open?
Katie O: Yeah, yeah. We'll do the support stuff before we dive into the rest.
Tim K: What do you mean? That's the important stuff… huh? I think that's the important stuff, isn't it?
Katie O: Which part the support or the… feedback? It's all important, Tim, it's all important, but we definitely need the feedback can't move forward without it. Mark, have you talked to Nick today? Is he still going to make it?
Tim K: I have not talked to Nick today.

Katie O: I see, will's not here either, so, I'm wondering if they're on a call together and it's running over. Let me chat, Nick.
Justin Z: He gives me a good chance to try and chew some food.
Katie O: It was our whole goal.
Justin Z: It worked. Amen.
Tim K: Justin, have you ever heard of this is a loaded question. So it may go offline. Have you ever heard of the morafar, golf course? It's up in like danbury.
Justin Z: I don't think so. What's the name of it?
Tim K: Morafar, it's like back will be on it's an aig owned course. It's supposedly incredibly exclusive.
Justin Z: Morafar. M o R a F o RM.
Tim K: OREF a R?
Katie O: Tim, you planning on joining?
Tim K: No, but I've got a kind of a unique opportunity to get out there.
Katie O: That's cool.
Tim K: Justin, I don't want to put you on a spot but you may want to check it out. I may be able to get… out there if you feel like I've heard from my brother in law that it's pretty crazy, pretty… like exclusive place… we're kind of doing like a sponsorship for an event. Hey, Nick.
Justin Z: Brewster New York. Is that where it is?
Tim K: Yep.
Justin Z: Okay. Yeah. It looks good. I haven't heard of it. I'll have to do a little more research.
Tim K: All right. I'll send you a quick note afterwards.
Katie O: All right. Well, real quick. Justin. I wanted to check in before we pass it over to Nick. Do you have anything you need from Kyle? Any topics for support that you'd like to go over?
Justin Z: I won't think so. I think Kyle's in the clear.
Katie O: All right. Well, then the purpose for today's call is to go over the feedback from your review of the new experience, for you to tell us exactly kind of what you thought, where you'd like to see improvements made and just generally like where… we go from here. I guess the first question is did you have a chance to review or do we need to open it up and do like the review on screen as we go?
Justin Z: I wouldn't do that to you. I did have a chance to actually look at a few things… not perfect, but there's plenty in my notes for discussion. So what I thought I could do is just sort of share screen on my end and just sort of go through my notes and we can sort of just talk as we're doing that. So let me share. And this is gonna be, we'll flip back and forth here between my notes… and the different things that are or the two different experiences. I'll mostly focus on the executive one, right? That Nick's been working on. But there were a couple of things that I was just sort of reviewing… between the two and I might show. So I guess sort of, you know, two things to highlight… here. One of them I stuck down the bottom but I'm just gonna call it out up here too is hold on device… compatibility. So… a, is it custom or is it native, right? How much sort of expertise do I need to be able to support, you know, the capabilities that we decide live on right? Through sort of proof of concept and some demos or whatever when we can get there. And then, you know, some of those answers might determine, you know, what we decide to ultimately put in the final, you know, or V1 MVP of the design. Let's let's call it for sort of broader fidelity use. And then the second thing is we always have the mobile experience in mind whether… that's the iPad or the phone. But for purposes of today, I'm not gonna worry about it because when I tried to look at my mobile for this, I, it was, you know, nothing was coming through. So there's probably all sorts of configuration changes I could make on my phone or that Nick could help me with that might make that better. And I haven't I didn't try the iPad either. So for purposes of today's, feedback and discussion, we'll just keep it super easy, right? Pretend I have a full nice monitor, pretend I'm on my desktop, right? Pretend it's you know, the executive experience is just, you know, just that, which is, I would say 90 percent of our usage anyway even though I want mobile and we know Abby uses the iPad, right? Like I want it all. But for purposes of, you know, general consumption and first pass, let's just talk about essentially how it looks today for most users on the, you know, on the desktop.
Nik K: Okay.
Tim K: In high level Justin, you see it, you've seen them both like the general UI and the expected navigations and where you Qlik and things like that are going to be identical, right? Like that's at least what we're seeing. So it should it gets you close, it's not 100 percent there.
Justin Z: Yeah. And so, you know, the issue for me right now, Tim is that when I try to use more, it's like it's not even close to the experience I get on desktop. So again, that could just be, we might be able to coach me into some things. We might be able to configure some things. But I'm not even going to worry about it for now because I think if we, you know, if we get the, you know, the desktop version, right? We will at least know that that's what we want on the other devices. And then we can sort of, you know, step through that too, but I probably wouldn'",Consumption Pricing Model,996777.93,NO ASSIGNED AE,FIDELITY.COM,8,Financial Services,68000,>=$1B,Upsell,Sales,3: Demonstrate Value,Tim Knight,2025-12-31,2024-09-30,2024-09-30,2025-08-06,,,,,0015000000F3KnIAAV

Aishwarya D: Hey, Eric. Good. How are you this morning?
Eric G: Good. I don't know. I'm sure Brian's joining. I don't know if Vu is going to join. So, I know he had a few things that he was going to help us with. He was pinging me this morning on a few of them. So, I know he's still working through some of the follow ups. Okay? So we may need to just like do whatever we can without him. I just noticed that he's like leading a meeting and it's at the same time as this one. So, unless I'm wrong, I think he's probably not joining, so we can wait for Brian and then get started.
Aishwarya D: Yep. Sounds good. Well, I did have a clarification on a calculation. So can I ask that question first?
Eric G: Yep. Let's get started. And if I don't know, then we will ask Brian.
Aishwarya D: Well, and before that, I would be having one more team member assisting me as, and when required. So, is it all right if I add her to the instance?
Eric G: Yeah, of course.

Eric G: No problem.
Aishwarya D: All right. Let me share my screen and I got the share screen fixed.

Eric G: Hey, Brian, I was just telling aish, Vu's got this other meeting at the same time as this. So my guess is he's not joining, but he was pinging us this morning on a couple of things. So I know he's working on some stuff related to this, yeah.
Brian W: The balance sheet is definitely coming in with all the books. Yeah.
Eric G: He asked us about ap, it sounded like he was getting closer though, I mean, he almost tied out our ap points. Nice. Good.
Aishwarya D: All right. So whatever changes we discussed yesterday, most of them have been implemented and I can just walk you through them one by one.
Eric G: OK, cool.
Aishwarya D: So, we decided to remove the nulls, so now the numbers are matching, which we did yesterday on the call, but it was split by group instead of group name. So now it's by the group name.
Eric G: OK, cool.
Aishwarya D: Then for… these cards, the breakdown was supposed to be changed for operating expenses. So that is in place now and you wanted to see all the categories under operating expenses.
Eric G: Yeah. OK. Let me, I'm just going to pull something up to. I'm not going to tie out all these, but just to make sure comp and benefits. Profit that ties total operating expenses should be. So… that… looks a little high… close Ish, but a little high comp and benefits… well close, but a little high. So, there's something that's inflating them a little bit, but it's pretty close… revenue and gross margin look, right?
Aishwarya D: Okay. I was just.
Eric G: talking out loud. Depreciation looks right… operating profits… looks wonky. No, looks, right? Yeah.
Brian W: Everything ties.
Eric G: The only thing that doesn't tie is that operating expenses, but I don't know why you'd think it would because the bottom line ties, let me just do some quick math. So gross profit is. That's right? Why doesn't it tie to our sheet?
Aishwarya D: You're saying the breakdown isn't tying?
Eric G: Yeah. I think just the, what's weird is like the, let me try to do it. I'm just going to do some quick math total.
Brian W: Objects looks fine with vertical.
Eric G: Does it?
Brian W: For the actuals in June? Yeah.
Eric G: Does this include ‑‑? Why… am I seeing in our slides that we sent out that we had ‑‑ because… that's.
Brian W: just the opos, if you go down ‑‑ I know what you're looking at add the one point seven.
Eric G: Got it. Never mind. We're good.
Aishwarya D: Okay.
Eric G: All right. Awesome. This ties.
Aishwarya D: So, I had a question regarding the calculation of the integers.
Eric G: John Mueller. OK?
Aishwarya D: So, this is currently showing column subtotal, the breakdown of the column subtotal. So gross profit breakdown. So that's why we decided to add a new card that would show the gross margin. So, let me show that to you.
Eric G: Yeah. Okay. So, how does that one look? Trying to figure out Brian, where we, I guess it's in the next slide… like that project service, GM bridges slide maybe is the one that we want.
Brian W: Yeah… and stuff, I think maybe the potential, yeah, the issue with that is like service and maintenance are kind of blended and are the old version. I think a lot of cases and you saw this, but like the other is just so wonky. I usually just make it blank.
Eric G: Okay. I think it's okay.
Brian W: Yeah, yeah. I think this is fine. You can.
Eric G: Look at it if they want to or they can skip over it. So, okay. And then year to date, I didn't check but I'm assuming, I mean, it's like the same thing, same logic. So, I'm just eyeballing it. Can you scroll up just a little bit? Aish, just so I can see the top of the right hand side. Okay. Yeah, it looks good. Again, it's within like fixed math.
Brian W: So, just a,
Aishwarya D: heads up with the percentages calculation. This is the breakdown by columns of total, but this is what we are testing to show by revenue, but it won't be possible because of the different classes. So we were just testing.
Eric G: Yeah, it's doing it as a percentage of like total revenue.
Aishwarya D: Yeah. So we'll just revert it to what this one's showing.
Eric G: Yeah, I think that's the right way to do it. Yeah. Okay. It's percent of total. And then if they want to see margin down below, they can.
Brian W: Yes.
Aishwarya D: And sorry… to just deviate a little bit on the format. No, go for it. Did you have any final decision made on the tables yet or no?
Eric G: I think the one on the left looks good again with a couple of the cleanup things we talked about. So like renaming service maintenance to call it maintenance if we can. Again. I know that then break if we change it later in sage, but just for now, yeah. And then where it's called?

Good morning, Jenna. How are you? Pretty good. Awesome. We've got the whole crew rolling in this morning. Did you have a good weekend? Yes. Awesome.
Ivan S: Good morning,
Jenna H: morning, friends.
John D: Good morning, everyone.
Ivan S: We'll wait a few minutes for everyone to join. Looks like we're just missing matt and Michael. I believe… John or apu, do you know if they're running a little bit late?
John D: I'll send a message. Stop.
Michael T: Hey, everyone.
Ivan S: Hello? Hey, matt.
Mat W: Hi, Evan.
Ivan S: How are you? Good? How was your weekend?
Mat W: It was good. Thank you.
Ivan S: That's good. I believe we have everyone so we can go ahead and get started. I know I sent over the meeting agenda kind of late on Friday, but did anyone get to look over it or are there any questions or concerns about it for?
Mat W: Today? No. I think I looked it over on Friday and again, this morning, you know, Ivan, I think some of the topics there, I think we can touch on. I think some of them are a little premature to be like coming to final kind of conclusions on yet because I think our goal here is to okay, what can we do with the data that we've got loaded, you know, and let's get a timeline in place or a game plan in place in terms of getting the other stuff connected, you know, and who's going to own that, you know? And then I think a parallel path in my opinion is, you know, maybe setting up a few dates with Scott and Jenna, and apu and John to kind of look at card building. You know what I mean? And work like work through some card building like in having separate sessions to, you know, let's take some of this data that we've actually got coming into Domo now and some of this historical data and build some of these, you know, call it jet report cards. And I think it would be helpful to have, you know, a separate session with the quote unquote card builders, you know, professionals and, you know, those being that want to be trained and going through that, you know, one on one, right? Kind of exercise on how you would do it. So I would add that to your list. I mean, I think don't know that it's a standing point there yet, but I'd like to kind of set some dates, you know, with the team.
Ivan S: Yep. I am making a note of that. Thank you. And I know we have a meeting right after this with mushi farms to go over some of the, yeah.
Mat W: The previous stuff.
Ivan S: Connectors? Yeah, previous stuff. Do we want to get started with the first point? I mentioned deployment status and licensing confirming? Yes, yeah.
Mat W: Yeah. Where that ended?
Ivan S: Yeah. Where did that end? Michael? Do you have any updates there?
Michael T: Sorry, the licensing proceed data?
Ivan S: Yes.
Michael T: Yeah. So we're still waiting on approval from Kronos group to make the purchase?
Mat W: So, Mike, maybe, you know, Mike, could you just send them a follow up email and CC me? And then I'll like, I think we just, it's a process. It's got to go through their approval process? I get it, but I think if you could, is there a con, did you send it to someone or does it just go to a like to a standard email?
Michael T: No, it's sent to Carly so that she can add them to the system. And then she sends all the information I gathered to Kronos group to approve it so she can add them to the system. Okay. Listen, I can go speak.
Mat W: To Carly, don't worry about it at all. After this call, I'll go speak to her.
Michael T: Okay. Otherwise, we have the quote and everything ready to go as soon as they're approved, I can push it through.
Mat W: Okay. And that's and that's going to be that's going to give us the automatic connection, correct? Mike. So like,
Michael T: that's going. Yeah. So once it's licensed, I can configure the auto data pulls and any remaining tables, the license is expired. The trial license is expired. John, and I tried pulling a table this morning and it stopped there. Okay?
Mat W: All right. So we basically need, yeah, we'll get it. We'll we'll follow up, get them to approve it. You know, shortly, we'll try to see if we can get it done today. And then hopefully we can start to get, you know, real data in.
Michael T: Yeah. Anything, anything created with those tables today will still work, once the live data is like updated like it'll just update automatically with that data. So, I mean, if you want to build cards and stuff, when did the trial expire? Michael? Yeah, the trial's expired.
Mat W: When did it expire?
Michael T: Oh, I don't know probably last week at some point, I haven't tried to do any polls since well, actually for a little while. So, as of this morning, I know that it's expired, but it was a 30 day trial. So I knew it was, I knew it was expired. I just don't know exactly which day.
Mat W: Yeah. Okay. But we've got some call it data up until the, you know, beginning of September in there, right? From when we June first, when we ran it or started till the beginning of September, we'll have the data in the tables. We'll have some data in it.
Michael T: To work with. Well, yes and no. So yes, we have the data that we pulled initially. No, it's not updated to September because it wasn't automated yet, right? Everything was just for trial and error, figuring out how it works and making it work. And until it was licensed, they weren't set up to auto pull data yet. So basically from the initial pull, we have data to kind of work with and play with. But we don't really have updated data in there yet.
Mat W: Okay. All right.
John D: We do have the legacy data that we imported or exported into CSV files and threw them into Domo that's the other data that we have. And that can be if we need any more data from the legacy, we can take them out. But pretty sure we made a pretty big list and uploaded that. So if we want to work with that kind of data as well, it's there.
Mat W: Yeah. Like, I think, I, you know, I think let's see what we can do to get this vendor approved today, you know what I mean? And then I think if the vendor's approved today, we'll purchase, you know, we'll purchase the cdata stuff, you know, ASAP.

Hey, Dylan.
Dylan J: Hey guys. How's it going? I'm in the car. So I'm going to leave my camera off, but I'm here.
Phil S: No problem. Hey, Amrit.
Amritanshu S: Hi guys. How are you doing? Happy Friday?
Phil S: Yes, happy Friday afternoon, doing pretty good. How about yourself?
Amritanshu S: Just waiting for five o'clock it has been a, pretty, long and a heavy week. So couldn't wait for it to end.
Phil S: Absolutely. Well, thanks for giving us some of your time on this.
Amritanshu S: Friday afternoon. You guys are trying to help us. So one should always find time for someone who is trying to help you very.
Phil S: Good philosophy. I like that it's hard to do sometimes because we think that we don't yeah.
Amritanshu S: That's true. Sometimes we can be like for example, like yesterday was one of those like we had like six or seven meetings from start to end, like becomes like too much of meeting because if you're going to so many meetings, you have to make sure that you are being productive at taking care of whatever is needed in that meeting and then switching context. Also. Yeah. And then, yeah. So a lot of AI plus being responsible for AI is both good and bad. Good because you are probably doing what everyone is trying to do or want to do bad because then everyone wants it. Then there are so many things on that. So, yeah, can't complain? I'm thankful to have this opportunity at least.
Phil S: Yeah, and expectations are sky high for AI, right? Like that's the other thing too.
Amritanshu S: I was eating my lunch the other day and I had, and then I saw something on the TV. I'll show you guys also, I took a picture of it. This is the day before yesterday, and I showed it to people in home depot as well.
Phil S: Nobody's betting too much on AI.
Amritanshu S: Like, yeah, so no, it's like I said, happy to have that opportunity at least or to be at the forefront of it rather than be at the back of it. So excited except trying everything with respect to everything. So very quickly. I think you guys did some setting change. I am not able to access Domo, AI, so I'm stuck with that. So I thought I'll give you guys a quick date on that. Let me share my screen. Are you able to see my screen?
Phil S: Okay. Yes.
Amritanshu S: So, I think when we switched over to new system though… I think what we are having issue is not just this, so this is one of that. But even when I was trying to set up the data, what I did was, after our last conversation, I went ahead and I created the data at my end which kind of mimics like different levels of information. Remember like I was walking you guys through the schema in a confluence page which I would want to do it. So I went ahead and I created it. And then when I uploaded the data like last time like an excel file and I wanted to add the context, I started getting a lot of errors for example. First thing was like when you upload the data and you go to the AI readiness section, you'll have to select the columns, right? Which you would want to have considered. So when I did that, so now, obviously, it is not showing because I have all the columns added. But whenever I selected one column and I clicked add columns, it would give me an error, not able to do it. Try again, not able to do it. Try again, I kept on doing it for a few iterations. And then I was like, okay, maybe I don't know what's happening. I'll probably reach out to you guys. And then I close and I come back and I just hit refresh. And then I see, oh, one column is added. Then then I go and do it for the second column. Again, same error, but I close it and I come back and I refresh again. It seems to be added. Then I went and I tried to do it for multiple columns and did the same thing. It did not do it. So I had to do it for each column again, one by one that's one. And then also, it was not telling me that it's adding it. It would still error out. So first that happened. Then once I was trying to do the additionary for each of the fields, same issue, whenever I would do something and save it, will just give me an error. So let's say if I can reproduce it in for you guys. And if it.
Benjamin P: Yeah, I'm getting the same. I'm in that instance, and I just was able to recreate the problem that you're talking about. OK?
Amritanshu S: So, this was a little bit of challenging to go through, but that meant basically spending extra time to do that. And then finally, when everything was ready, I was like, OK, let's get to see how does it taste the dish as I couldn't put it on the plate because of this disable. So I'm not sure what this.
Benjamin P: Yeah, it sounds like this was an issue that you were having until we moved the instance. So maybe there's something that happened there whenever we moved that over. So we'll just need to make mention of these things in our internal thread and see if they can take a look at those items because it looks like it's causing some.
Phil S: So it's mainly I'll respond back to the thread. Now. AI chat is completely just not working in the instance. Any of the other big ones?
Amritanshu S: The setup was complicated.
Benjamin P: It's not letting you add columns in the AI readiness dictionary. Okay? It looks like you have to use the demo provided model.
Amritanshu S: Do I need to change something?
Benjamin P: Which one are we wanting to use… earlier? I just,
Amritanshu S: used the default option. I didn't change anything over there.
Benjamin P: Will you go up to more at the top Emmert… and go to admin? And then scroll down and then go to AI services layer and go to settings… right there at the bottom on the left.
Amritanshu S: This one. Yeah.
Benjamin P: Settings. Alright. You see the little yellow triangle? If you hover over that, it's showing that you haven't checked any of the demo provided models there below. And so I'm wondering if all of the errors are you you're getting as a result of none of those having been chosen yet. So I think I believe if you choose at least one of those… yeah, then we can now, let's try to let's try.
Amritanshu S: But these, okay. Let's see.

Mamta B: You have any fun plans for the weekend?
Shelly V: I do not, my teenage son started his first job, so, I'm his taxi… my weekend has to revolve around him… that's okay.
Mamta B: Yeah, but he's got to become independent and a confident individual, and that's all that matters.
Shelly V: That's correct. We need to work up to driving. So, I'll be his taxi for a little bit.
Mamta B: Hi, everyone. Hey, Ray.

Mamta B: Yes, yep.
Raymond A: Okay. Sorry for my tardiness. All right. So, is Gupta coming? Do we want to wait?
Shelly V: I'm not sure. Looks like he let's see.
Raymond A: I probably have enough to take up the whole meeting, so.
Shelly V: Okay. Yeah, you can get started.
Raymond A: Okay. So, well… I'll tell you what this one topic about the duplicate rows. Do you want me to save that for next week with Casey?
Shelly V: Yeah, I don't think you need help with it, right?
Raymond A: No, I don't need help, but I think it needs to be brought to somebody's attention. All right. So, all right. I'll move on. So migrating, so, Mamta, I'm migrating a dashboard. Well, so what I did initially was I took our gff end… to end app studio, right? And I just replicated it, right? Because I felt like that would be the easiest thing to do and then just reconnected my data sets because it's on it's. On naf. We're on naf. Now, we're no longer on iaf. So, you know, I kind of got everything where I needed it, you know, moved all the data sets or moved the sets, et cetera. And, and that was just so that I can focus strictly on naf. So if we have any like updates to iaf, you know, I could push to production or whatever, you know, I just, I wanted two separate environments, you know, so, I could work on iaf and, you know, or naf without iaf being affected. So now that I'm mostly done, I want to migrate all of that to the iaf app. And so I don't know if it's important that I tell you that, you know, it was first a replication of the iaf, but now when I move, when I migrate everything back to iaf, things get sort of sideways… I took all of the tabs from naf and migrated them to iaf. And when I did that, a lot of the cards and the filters ended up in the index and all of the space where those filters and cards were. They still had like they weren't spacers, but they were, you know, more or less tiles where the cards, you know, should go. So I ended up just deleting the tabs because I didn't want to spend the time moving cards back in their place. And, you know, dealing with all of that. So I wonder if you had any thoughts on that, I think.
Mamta B: Maybe, do you want to share your screen? Yeah, if you want to share your screen, then we can look into it.
Raymond A: Okay. Sorry, I have to respond to this message, real quick. Hang on. Huh. Oh, hey, Gupta, you snuck in quietly?
Mamta B: Hey, there. Hello, everyone.
Shelly V: Hello?
Mamta B: So, question here, right? So you had an app, right? You built a content in dashboards or did you build them in the app itself? You built the cards directly in the app?
Raymond A: Yeah. In the app. Okay. I'll show you the well, I mean, so. So, here's the naf. So this is a direct, you know, rip off of the iaf… right? So this being iaf, I just replicated the whole thing. And then once it was replicated here, I started changing names and changing cards and connecting data sets, you know, et cetera. Et cetera. Okay. So now that I have this, what I did was I imported pages… from naf service dashboard… and I wanted to duplicate cards because not interested in, you know, there's just too many complications, right? When you're just using the same cards include all of this, right? And… this will take a moment.
Shelly V: Okay.
Raymond A: Well, actually, I probably should have not included year… to date summary and trends because that's going to go in the same card, right? You still wanted that Shelly, you still wanted these two to go… those cards I.
Shelly V: Wanted on the same?
Raymond A: Yeah, on the same tab.
Shelly V: Same tab.
Raymond A: All right. So, okay. Looks like we're looks like we're done… thought I would see them. Oh, yeah. No, thought I would see them here, but I guess not.
Mamta B: You just need to look at the Fish.
Raymond A: Okay. All right. Here, they are. So, iaf… and then the rest of them are going to be here. So, all right. So let's Qlik on this one. Yep see the space is still there. But they're all in the index. So I was really wanting to avoid that, moving them into place, but I don't… know maybe it was.
Mamta B: Overwhelmed some cards, no. So some cards got placed correctly and some did not, is what you're saying, right?
Raymond A: Right. Yeah.
Mamta B: Yeah, that must be a bug. Sorry, that's something that I don't… think I have insights into, but, yeah, this seems to be a bug. Okay? Some cards are getting placed and some are not.
Raymond A: And it's yeah, it's going to be that way for… well, this one came through actually. Yeah, this one?
Mamta B: Yeah, it looks like… yeah, I would say that's a bug.
Raymond A: All right.
Mamta B: I would raise a support case just for them to know so they can fix it.
Raymond A: All right. Sounds good. My second idea was maybe to do them one at a time, just import one tab at a time, but.
Mamta B: You can try that. You can try like, do you want to just try importing again? Just one tab at a time just to see if that works?
Raymond A: All right. Okay. Back to normal. Let's do… here to date details. So far? So good. Oh, this one, I think this is the one that did come in, okay?
Mamta B: All.
Raymond A: Right. Well, I'll go ahead and keep that one there. Customer details. Let's do that.
Mamta B: Oh, you want to duplicate the cards?
Raymond A: Okay.
Mamta B: Yeah, no, you should not be deleting it.
Raymond A: Yep. You're right?
Mamta B: Do a cancel? Does that not import it? Just cancel it on the top. Don't save it.
Raymond A: I'm trying, but it doesn't seem to be responding.

Z S: Kathy, are you here? Oh, it says she's using companion mode.

Z S: All good. Thanks, Kathy. Thanks for coming. Of course. Yeah. So I'm sure Bellamy already told you this, but we're just going to go over the requirements that we want to see in Domo from the intake side. So I can also quickly share my screen and go over some data that I think would be useful. And Ben, I'll send a PDF to you as well. Yeah, sounds good. Unless you already have questions or something, we can also do that.
Benjamin P: No, I think let's just jump into what you've got and then we might have questions that come from that.
Kathy H: Okay.
Z S: I'll share my screen and Kathy, yeah, I could use your feedback on this because I think I could flush this out a bit more, but I can also meet with you after this to fill it in some stuff. Okay. Can you guys see my screen?
Kathy H: Yes.
Z S: Okay. So, yeah, Ben, as you know, Kathy's head of intake so that's bringing on new patients and there's a snapshot of like patient history status needs etc. And this is kind of the data that I… think would be most useful to bring into Domo. So, Kathy, if you think there's stuff that's missing, feel free to jump… in. But first is Salesforce stuff. This is future. So I think we can ignore that for now. So, there will be patient referral data from careport. So this is all the patient referral information. And this would be the source. There would also be episode information for like soc confirmation, timestamps etc, and this comes from snowflake. So this is already set up with Domo. And then there's also a lot of Domo data flows that already exist in there like intake team filters and all that stuff. Yeah, I think, oh, and these would be the filters. So date range, intake, rep, zip… code and status. So, Kathy, is there anything that you think should be added here? I will go ahead and do that.
Kathy H: So, Ziba, I'm a little out of the loop of what we're discussing. To be quite honest with you, I thought you were going to show me something about RingCentral going into Domo. I'm not aware of all this other stuff that you're mentioning right now going into Domo, like the intake process. I'd have to talk to you offline about that.

Kathy H: let me ask something since I'm just trying to again understand what would be the purpose of sending all this information to Domo? Like would we be working off Domo or is this something that just for leaderships and some other people outside of the intake team would have opportunity to review like the referral information and referral like outcomes and stuff like that, because again, I am completely lost. I am not aware of this.
Z S: Oh, okay. Then, let's meet soon. Then we don't have to do this right now. I think we can reschedule this, but this would be just mostly for you being able to have all your data in Domo, be able to use filters and play around with it and have it all in a consolidated place. Okay?
Kathy H: Yeah. Let's talk about it because right now again, it's on Monday. Com, right? And really after just again, so everyone knows right now at least within our current process, once there's been a final outcome of a referral, right? There's really two outcomes, right? One is that we actually that the intake staff, excuse… me, completes the process in the sense of sending it out, assigning it to the clinical members, right? And for admission. Yeah. So once that happens for intake, if we are endorsing it or however you want to put it to the clinical world, our part is essentially done. We don't really need to look at anything else or we don't go back to look for any history or anything like that. There's reasons why we may be pinged back to go back to a certain case. But overall, we're really done. The only other outcome that can happen if it's not admission is that we don't produce admission which is non admit, right? The patient is not admitted into service. And then for sure, for those ones where we, yes, there's reports that are generated at the end of the month for purpose to see why we had so many patients not accept care or whatnot right? And then that data is reviewed and dissected. I'm a little confused about what the purpose would be to transfer all this to Domo and who would benefit from it because I don't see a lot of how I'm understanding at least right now how if any intake would benefit from that transfer information being transferred.
Z S: Okay. That's fair. Let me talk with Bellamy about that. So I guess we can just quickly go over the RingCentral stuff since that's what you were expecting to see.
Kathy H: Right. Because that's what you reached out to me about yesterday and he did mildly mention it on Tuesday to me and then you reached out to me yesterday so that's what's fresh on the mind and that I know that there's something being worked on in regards to the reports that are important to us right now that we are still learning from the new RingCentral CX and it is very important right now for us to have the ability to not just pull reports but more than anything have reports that actually are giving us the data that we need in the sense of what is the call volume?

The key highlights were the volume of invoices processed daily, the file formats of the invoices, the potential to leverage the MIP API to automate data extraction and entry, and the need to test the integration in a development environment before implementing it in production. The team agreed to share sample invoices and further explore the technical details of the MIP API to determine the best approach for the integration.","Ankit S: hello, everyone. Good morning.
David S: Well, good morning. How are you doing?
Ankit S: Doing well, doing well. I don't believe I have met everyone formally. I know we've been communicating through email and I know you know, Shane and possibly Ben, but pleasure to meet everybody.
David S: Well, it's nice to meet you as well.
Benjamin P: Hey, guys.
David S: Hey, Ben.
Benjamin P: How's everybody doing?
David S: Good. Not too bad yourself?
Benjamin P: I am doing well.
David S: Well, hey guys. I know we were hoping that Linh would be able to join us for this meeting, but unfortunately, she does have a conflict and will not be able to join. So, we'll do our best to support you guys however we can.
Benjamin P: Yeah, appreciate that. David. It's been quite a few weeks since we met last and so, I'd like to level set a little bit and just understand sort of the direction that we're going with the project and gather the requirements that we need in terms of data and to… support the use case and talk about what next steps we can put in place to get started. Does that sound okay?
David S: Yeah, that sounds good. And this meeting is being recorded. Is that correct?
Ankit S: Yes, that's correct.
David S: Okay.
Ankit S: And I can send the recording to you by end of day today.
David S: Okay. Yeah, that'd be great just in case, Linh, wants to review it after she gets back.
Ankit S: Yeah, absolutely.
David S: I appreciate it.
Benjamin P: So, David, I'm not sure if you were on the last call that we had or that the pre, I believe we actually had two calls before this one. Yeah.
David S: I believe I might have been out of the country on the last one. Yeah, sorry.
Benjamin P: Okay. So the goal, the reason we're here and the reason we're engaging with you guys is we are offering you guys have been identified as a customer who could benefit from our adoption program. And the adoption program offers free consulting services to organizations like yours to build out use cases that can increase the value that you're getting from the demo platform. So it's no cost to you for us to be engaged and to build these projects out. But the benefit on the demo side is that hopefully these use cases result in you guys using the platform greater and also getting more value from the use cases that we're building out. And so it's sort of a benefit on both sides for us to come in and help you understand ways that the demo platform can tackle the problems that you may be facing or challenges that you might have within the organization. And so, we've identified this ap automation as one use case. If there's other opportunities that you know, of where you believe Domo can offer value or assist with automating some of your business processes that's what we're here for, we want to identify what those are so that we can put it on a roadmap and discuss when we can go in and help tackle that problem. So, while today we want to dive in deeper on the ap automation use case, I just wanted the team just to be mindful that we are here to assist beyond just one use case. And so we would love to discuss other opportunities that we can engage with the team to help you get greater value from the Domo platform. Is that the understanding… that you already had, or was that a refresher or does that help?
Michelle C: No, I think we're all on the same page.
Benjamin P: Wonderful. So on the last call, we talked about, you guys have invoices and the process of entering data from those invoices into your ap system is pretty time consuming. We never talked about exactly how many invoices you're getting on a weekly basis or if this is a weekly task or if it's a monthly task from the team, maybe it's a daily task. So I want to understand for a moment, number one, what's the volume of invoices that you're typically, seeing how many people are working on this and how many people will this tool impact? And then we can talk about how we can use and leverage different tools within the demo platform to automate this process for you. To ultimately, the goal would be to adjust those files and to the best of our ability, pull out as much of that information that you're manually entering as possible and pre populate that on a form and have the user who typically does all this manually go in and fill in the required fields that may not have been able to obtain from the file itself and then write that back to your ap system. Can you help me understand what that volume is and how many users this would be impacting?
Michelle C: Sure. So currently, we have four ap staff members assigned to accounts payable and entering invoices. They enter roughly anywhere from 100 to 200 invoices a day. So volume wise, you're looking at what is that? 400 to 500 a day per month?
Benjamin P: Thank you. So it's 100 to 200 invoices per day per person?
Michelle C: Yes, per person.
Shane W: And are those invoices, are they from like the same? Like are they always like different? Or are there similar data structures in those? Like, are they from the same organization? Like how do those invoices, where do those invoices come from?
Michelle C: Yeah. So they're pretty repetitive. You will see that the pharmaceutical expenses are the ones that are the most repetitive and that's the largest volume of invoices that we receive. So that would be like vendors like cardinal health, mckesson, RX. Those have the higher amount of volumes and there's about five GL codes that we use for those particular vendors, but all of the vendors have, they tend to use the same GL code. The only thing that will be changing would be the location in the department.
Benjamin P: Sorry, I'm just taking some notes here. Are all of those typically PDF files or does it vary significantly in terms of the file format?
Michelle C: No, most are PDF files, but you have some vendors that send excel files?
Benjamin P: And how of those 100 to 200 invoices per day? How many of those would you say deviate from being a PDF?
Michelle C: Maybe five to 10 percent?
Benjamin P: Okay. Okay.

Aishwarya D: Yeah. Did you get enough rest this weekend?
EricGroetzin O: Yes, I did. I needed it. How was your weekend?
Aishwarya D: It was pretty busy. We had a couple of things lined up regarding my documents and moving to the states soon. Okay. Cool. So, I was working on the visa and the documents. It was pretty busy.
EricGroetzin O: Well, that's exciting though.
Aishwarya D: Yes, yes, it is.
EricGroetzin O: Where are you moving?
Aishwarya D: Florida, fort lauderdale?
EricGroetzin O: Okay. Cool. That's awesome. Are you going to still be working for Domo? I don't know if I've.
Aishwarya D: asked you. Yes. Yeah, I will be, but I don't know how it will be like… the clauses or the legal guidelines because my visa status would change. So, I don't know if there's like a period where I have to go on a break for like 20 days and then come back. I don't know how that would be, but let's see.

Brian W: Good, fixed my zoom. I don't have the codes at the end of my name anymore, so.
EricGroetzin O: Oh, okay. Yeah. It's the migration that we did probably causing problems. Have you talked to Vu this morning or should I ping him?
Brian W: Yeah, I have not. But can you ping him? I think most of our open items are what we need his help on.
EricGroetzin O: I ping them especially because we've only got 30 minutes. So if he can't make it, then we probably won't accomplish much. Yeah.
Brian W: It might be worth you looking at where we stand now because I think we've made some progress. I did.
EricGroetzin O: So I looked at the notes that Ankit sent out. So those were helpful to kind of catch me up on where we stand. Yeah, maybe let me pull them back up. I also looked at the dashboard today. It looks like we've made some good progress… but let me before, I like, there are still a few things I'm noticing, but before I do, okay. So a couple of them already addressed. So the first one ash you mentioned trying to find a workaround for the class distinction for opex and EBITDA. So I assume you mean in those year to date and month to date, P LS, we show revenue by class, cost by class, and then we show opex by class. But like we don't want to do that, we would want to show it by like PL line. Is that what that is, right?
Aishwarya D: Yes. Okay. And it will require additional logic in the ETL. Okay? So we can get it. They're just in different columns. So I don't know how it will affect the other cards because it'll change. We'll have to change the formatting then.
EricGroetzin O: Okay. Got it. Do we need Vu's help with this one specifically?
Aishwarya D: We can ask him, but I think there are other action items that we can prioritize with Vu because we still need to work on the visuals after we get those action items. And I mean, if it's extremely important, then yeah, we can definitely address it with Vu and take a call.
EricGroetzin O: Okay. Yeah. I think this one maybe not the most important one on this list, but it's medium importance. I mean, we definitely need to get it done before we start validating. I would yeah categorize things as like low importance would be like 100,000 dollar or less variances. Don't care. I mean, some won't care, but don't really care. Moderate things would be like this. And then major things would be like, let me scan your list, see if they're on here. But like networking capital, yeah.
Brian W: The balance sheet stuff.
EricGroetzin O: Balance sheet stuff is the biggest gap that I can see. Another thing that I noticed this morning can't remember if I've brought it up before and I'm scanning your list to see if it's already in here. The top two summaries are very close. Like when I say the top two summaries, I mean, the two tables, like there's one that is the consolidated summary and one that's the group summary. They're both slightly off and I think all of the issues have to do with east union.
Brian W: Is it the budget numbers?
EricGroetzin O: Yeah, it's budget month to date and year to date. Yeah.
Brian W: We know that. And then.
EricGroetzin O: it's year to date actuals are off too. And I was going like I was looking at the top table and I was like, why don't these tie out? And then I went to the group summary and like ticked and tied each group.

Inna L: Oh, we're good. Okay. Marlee, you can go ahead and get started your presentation.
Marlee M: Okay. So good afternoon to you guys. I'm going to show you how our compliance team do our day to day process. So I'm going to share my slides. So this one right here, once intake is done creating profile for confirmed patient, home health, patient, those patients will populate in Monday com in our admission board and those patients we need to process on that day, verification start by using the mrn number. It needs to match across both carestitch, Kinser, and Monday. Com. Here, this one right here, and also in Kinser, this one right here. Once all three criteria are matched, referral management will commence, we are going to be downloading the referral first for our basis in entering this data in Monday. Com.
Bellamy Y: Hold on. Sorry. So, sorry, we're going at like a 1,000 Miles an hour right now. So can we start really quick from Marlee? Your department's like main purpose and what type of data do you guys treat each day first instead of going straight into the process?
Marlee M: Okay. This one, Bellamy, we need to enter this data in Monday com first?
Bellamy Y: Okay. Yes.
Marlee M: And then after entering this data, we proceed to carestitch.
Inna L: Marlee. I think he wants to just like to look at executive level. Maybe I'll step up just for a real introduction. So basically, I'm a head of four departments, right? I think I did give you presentation, right? One of the departments is compliance department and this department basically working with admissions patient. We just been admitted to the services. And main purpose is to make sure we in compliance with protocols and processes, like we have several protocols for admissions timeframe for patient acuity level like high medium risk, we have certain protocols. We have covid protocols. And also, we, this department also collect a lot of data for timeliness of socs, for timeliness of the evaluations of therapy, which links to bonuses of the clinicians. So the main purpose is to make sure we in compliance with all the regulations and processes and protocols. And also on top of it, we collect data and mainly a lot of work done manually and transitioning data from Monday. Com, from carestitch to Monday. Com basically, and from Kinzer, to Monday. Com, right? Right? Marlee.
Marlee M: Yes, Inna, I just wanted to ask if there's a chance that like for example, we keep on jumping in from carestitch to Kinzer, then we do the same thing like adding concierge in carestitch. And then we also add the concierge in Kinzer. If there's any way that we can find a single way to enter only… like for example, if we enter the clinician or the concierge in carestitch, it will follow the Kinzer.
Bellamy Y: Let's have those kind of automation conversation with the snowflake team. Yes, Domo can help with that. But our organization with Domo's automation right now and integration is not set up to the level where we can use those kind of systems. Plus carestitch is not API. It's going to have to use robotic processing. And I don't think Domo has that. Is that right? Ben… RPA?
Benjamin P: Yeah, it would depend on where the data is located. So, you're saying there's no API that would allow us to pull the data?
Bellamy Y: Yeah, no pulling and no pushing either for carestitch and Kinzer. So that would be more of our automation tools realm Marlee. So let's have those kind of conversation in terms of automation with snowflake and mulesoft team with Ben, what we do want to talk about is any kind of reporting things that you guys do on a regular basis that stems from the data collection that you guys do on Monday. Com. So tsoc, you know, teval, all of that, I've already created that stream to performance assessment for the clinicians right now, we're more talking about, forget about the clinicians for a second. And we're more talking about on a territorial level, right? Area level. What are some of those analytics that you need to be done?

Michael D: That's got to be tough.
William M: Yeah… yeah. And then there's all the minutiae of, well, who's going to fix the water gap? Is that us or cousin Harry? I don't know guys, you know?
Michael D: Are there a lot to fix or to keep up or?
William M: We've got about 3,400 acres.
Michael D: Wow. So.
William M: There is always something.
Michael D: Right.
William M: And we got notice a few months ago that encore wants to put a power line through. Oh,
Michael D: really?
William M: It's the biggest power line they've ever done in Texas?
Michael D: Huh.
William M: It's literally twice the size of their biggest current line.
Michael D: And are they compensating you for that or no?
William M: Well, we are fighting it at this point.
Michael D: Oh, okay.
William M: There are three proposed routes… to me… it hadn't been justified, but it's been approved already by the public utility commission. So, as they say, it's going in regardless.
Michael D: Oh, gosh.
William M: So, I think it's like data centers. I think that's what's driving it, they were, they told us that it was, they needed the energy in the permian basin. I'm like permian basin has more damn energy than half of the world.
Michael D: Oh, my gosh.
William M: And you really want to run power from the nuclear plant… know, it's just. It's politics. It's BS, it's you know, and it's going to ruin a whole lot of ranches.
Michael D: Oh, is it? So you're not the only one impacted? You got others? It?
William M: Goes all the way across the state.
Michael D: Oh,
William M: so, the power plant is in Glen rose, which is east of us here… and it's like a little southeast of DFW and it goes all the way out to the permian basin, which is midland Odessa. And it… just cuts right across the middle of the state… and it… hits three tracks on our place. I can't remember how many on my cousins across the street. And then it hits their main ranch on the other side of town. One of the guys, it will impact like three homes on his property. It cuts across ours. Like… it's there's like a main, 1,600, and it cuts across the top half of that. And it literally, Ellen and I, you know, six, eight months ago, we're talking about, you know, that's really where I'd want to put a house.
Michael D: Right where they're running it through.
William M: And, right, yeah, right? Where they want to run this thing. So. I don't know.
Michael D: Well, I hope your fight goes well. I know it's not easy.
William M: We're we're in the like letter writing campaign, and I was talking to my cousin that's an attorney in town and.
Michael D: He's, huh.
William M: He's like, you know, you're… wasting your time, with encore. It's nothing's gonna happen until it goes to the puc, And I'm like, well, we want encore to recommend some other path first that ours is not the one, you know, of least resistance. Right. And he was like, well, you know, you're wasting your time with them. I'm like, oh, gosh, so I don't know, I don't know where the truth lies in that one.
Michael D: Right.
William M: But I figure if I can be a thorn in encore's side, they've earned it.
Michael D: There you go. Give them hell.
William M: Yeah.
Michael D: Thank.
William M: You.
Michael D: all right. Hi, Omar. How are you doing?
William M: Hey, Omar.
Omar D: I'm fine. How are you guys?
Michael D: Doing good. Thanks. This may be a small group today. I know Steve is on an alaskan cruise with his family, so, he won't, be joining nice. And then I'm gonna assume that Todd is out because I don't see him yet. He.
William M: Isn't.
Michael D: okay.
William M: He will be back on.
Michael D: Monday. Is there anything support ticket wise that I need to track down with his backup? That's critical for you guys?
William M: That open order deal where the sequel dropped. Well, 90 percent of the rows.
Michael D: Okay.
William M: And I know that's been escalated, yeah. But that's… you know, the longer that goes, the, it's a daily snapshot. So, the more it impacts, all of that reporting.
Michael D: Downstream, okay. Yeah, I see it's escalated. So, it already has the highest priority, but let me follow up and see, what the latest update is on it, are you getting any messages via the portal?
William M: No, no, okay. Just, you know, just that it got escalated.
Michael D: Okay. Alright. I'll track that one down for you. Anything else that you're tracking or were tracking with Todd?
Omar D: From my side, no, the adrenaline thing is running. Okay?
Michael D: Okay. Knock on wood.
William M: Yeah, exactly.
Michael D: Okay. I think our.
William M: Swatchbox connector is good. And then we've got this password change alert that's popping up.
Michael D: Yes, I did see that one.
William M: And I'm, working with, somebody at mohawk, and I got a response with… my mouse. Yeah. For the Domo, sso, we are only signing the saml, request from our side. We are not validating the certificate from the Domo side. This change will not affect us. So, whatever change is going into effect, on… like the 20 fifth that shouldn't affect us, I guess.
Michael D: Okay. It's good to hear. Alright. If there is anything that comes up, please let me know. I know Todd's gonna be back like you said next week, but, I will track down, the ones that we just called out, and if there is ",Traditional Pricing Model,909824.12,NO ASSIGNED AE,DALTILE.COM,9,Engineering & Construction,9000,>=$1B,Upsell,Blank,1: Pre-Pipeline,Luke Perry,2025-11-14,2025-05-02,,,,,,,0015000000yIb4aAAC

Not bad. How are you? Not bad at all, man? Good?
Ted S: Good.
William W: Kicking the tires and lighting the fires as they say.
Ted S: I like it.
William W: Well, normally, I'd BS with you a little bit especially now that football season is going, but I got a bit to dive into. So I'll probably just go straight for it man.
Ted S: I'm all for it.
William W: Cool. Okay. So I'm duking it out with this thing right now. So you'll see one element of this that looks a little bit. I don't want to say broken, but it's just not performing the way that I would like. So just know it's in flight. Okay? So some of the changes that you had mentioned last time, pretty important ones is the ability to filter for supervisors. So that's now in there. And then the, what… was the other one there was?
Ted S: I know I mentioned the packet names. It looks like you changed that too, which seems in line with what I would expect.
William W: That was interesting. It's such a good call out because we were actually, I was flattening the data improperly because of that and I'm sure you caught that, but I did not. And so now you'll probably see like the lot count is a lot more realistic versus like the whole job.
Ted S: Yeah, you shouldn't have huge numbers. In that case, sometimes they'll still have quite a few lots, but in the most part, they're more digestible chunks.
William W: Yeah, it makes sense. So I actually cleaned up the verbiage in here, but I wanted to pause on this and make sure like no other verbiage or nothing on here looks out of whack.
Ted S: Sure. They say a packet name, po, yeah. P, po is actually the customer is what I see there. Okay? I'm not sure if that's data that I'm pulling in poorly or what, but a job's good lot… start. Yeah, everything else seems in line with what I would expect there.
William W: Cool. Excellent. There's a little bit of redundancy right here from how it was laid out. I think it had the packet or I don't know, I'll clean this up on the sort function. It was a good call out. And I think you guys talked about this a little bit more heavily before I got engaged. So I'm glad that you said it. It's like, hey, the purpose of this is for the supervisors to be able to go and see who is not stacked. And so I did add these in there. I showed you that last week. And because we don't have any jobs stacked up, it's not going to.
Ted S: Has capacity, sure. I like that a lot because often we'll fill out teams and then look, I mean, it's an iterative process. But in that case, we would look to see who has availability. And then if that's not a good fit, we'd iterate from there.
William W: Yes, that's exactly right… there's. Other things that I caught in going back and what's our motivation here? I'll address those. I think they're phase two and phase three, but it's hard to do certain things without.
Ted S: Thinking ahead. Yeah.
William W: Like to box it into like, oh, we're going to do it for phase one. There's a lot of things you'll see that look incomplete and we'll discuss those in a minute to make sure I'm aligned with you. But you can see it's stacked up here. And then over here, you'll have assigned packets. This is pulling in the data that you already have. And it's also leveraging when we store this in what's called the collection here. And so those are both now looking at assigned. It's a bigger and it's important for reporting. But like we can make it so that the collection here joins with that other data set. And if we have data in the collection, it overrides the data that you're pulling in from on. I forget what your.
Ted S: profit keys are, ERP system. If that's what you're getting the actual scheduling.
William W: Yeah. So I'll leave that up to you but there are gonna be some elements where you and I will talk about that to make sure that like the final version of this doesn't just feel like a whiteboard. It feels like it's actually merging with your data in your data lake. We don't need to push back to that, but we will wanna make sure that at a point where you feel so good about what's on here, it does take precedent and you're reporting in like your app or other dashboards or whatever.
Ted S: Yeah. I think there could be usable data that's populated here that we would wanna extract. So I think I'm at least in line with what you're saying there. Cool. Yeah, visualization there of all of the lots. I guess I don't know if you already counted on that or not, but really probably wouldn't need that necessarily unless you wanted to like double Qlik on it. I don't know if that's easier from a standpoint right now, thinking ahead to actually assigning by the particular levels, but access data at this point, just looking generically at capacity would be probably sufficient. And then you could Qlik on it and find the details. But again, I don't know if I'm throwing any curve balls or not.
William W: Well, what I'm trying to figure out and this is me thinking ahead the data getting pushed out at a lot level. This is a bad example because there's only one lot, let's go here. So this, what I'd be interested in your take on is that these auto allocate to whoever's filtered, and we just say push and then they can go in and tune it and move lots around and reassign to different people on a lot level. But this thing uses not, it's not even AI. I don't want to make it out to be something that it isn't it's just a ranked function where like.
Ted S: First in, okay. Okay. Yeah.
William W: Exactly. Like if the most available person gets the eight point two five basically, and so on and so forth. So that's where I'm kind of keeping it broken out like this. So that's part one, part two, I've got to figure out how to get this to where the supervisor can drag this over to someone else, and reassign it. And then step three and Nick had this in his final prototype before he handed it over to me. The ability there. There's like a few things here. So if I'm doing too much at once just pause me.
Ted S: You're good. I think I'm following, okay?

Fui K: Well, Nick, you're pretty tall, right?
Nik K: Yes, it's true.
Fui K: That's it caught me off guard. It was like literally the same thing you're talking about, Julian. I was just like Nick, I'm pretty sure, but, you know, it's one of those that until you actually see them in person.

Fui K: don't know I had,

Fui K: Was one old colleague, when I was at Salesforce when I met her for the first time, she's like, whoa, you're huge. I was like, thank you. I don't know what to make of that, you know, yeah… but on cameras, you don't really, you know, get it, right? You don't get the in person experience, so.
Juliana J: Yep. You definitely cannot tell how tall people most people are on camera. So… that's funny, right?
Fui K: It looks like Shannon tentative the director of operations. But their main majordomo… Shivam, he accepted. So I'm just going to ping him right now because last time we ended up waiting like almost 10 minutes.
Juliana J: Oh, yeah. That was this one.
Fui K: Okay. I see cgu, Juliana and their CFO, his name's Colin. So… I know that they've been working with support just to give you the heads up, Nick on some of the entrata connector issues. So, I have no doubt that'll probably be something that they'll bring up, but I… mean, it's more so on the entrata side, but our support team has been great, you know, trying to work through some of the issues, but it's really, it's not on our side as much as it is on entrata's. So.
Nik K: Okay. Yeah. I was reading through support tickets earlier today, so it seemed like one issue was the authentication change and they need to move to a new connector, but were they having issues with the new connector? Were things missing or?
Fui K: That's yeah, it was a little ambiguous. That part. I couldn't really understand either.
Nik K: Okay. And then they mentioned there are some third party connectors they were using, but I, yeah, I don't know if there was stuff missing in the main one. So maybe that's what we can unpack but.

Shivam M: I think I am able to present my screen.
Nik K: Yeah, it's OK. Yeah.
Shivam M: So, the issue which I'm facing right now is see that I'm using this connector and this is Domo's connector. Yeah. When I get into this, my API, I'm using box code, I'm trying to fetch. So I'm using this box code, I'm using this report version. And for some reason, I'm not able to get the right structure. I have used the structure which I was using previously for other intrada connectors. OK? But I think that there is a mistake in the format. I am unable to get the data here. I'll show you the data what it is right now. So it's not failing but it isn't fetching anything. It's showing, this.
Nik K: Oh, OK. And if you don't give a filter, is it able to get the data?
Shivam M: Nothing because I like the filter is the mandatory parameter. So, I have like I started on July eleventh, right? So, initially like this connector itself was, you know, throwing some errors that, you know, error calling this particular API point. I raised a ticket and the issue got resolved somewhere here, July 28 and then, but it started working but it's still, it's not fetching. Okay. Can you?
Nik K: Go to the settings tab. Yeah. So you did report data? Okay. Yeah. Okay. And scroll down. Is that the only filter property group?

Dale W: Hey, again, Mike.
Michael N: Let's see if I can get this up. Hey, Dale… they just put a bunch of new backgrounds in our zoom.
Dale W: Get it back up a little bit, get that brain right on your head. Yeah, line it up perfect.
Michael N: Trust me mine is significantly smaller… probably looks like that though. All dark murky.
Dale W: With the glowing edges.
Michael N: Yeah. Joe should be here shortly. What do we have going today, Dale?
Dale W: I'm in master data hell.
Michael N: What do… you guys use as your MDM solution?
Dale W: Ipg has another garbage ware, oracle one that they bought that they tried to attach to sap the different instances of sap, and then they have custom third party tools that they attach on top of that to try to issue some uch and other nonsense… too.
Michael N: So, you got to deal with all that today. Is that the integration that's.
Dale W: no, this is more fundamental. HR doesn't talk to finance. And so people have titles that have no grades or vice versa. And it's two people that they just don't talk and everybody knows they don't talk and no leader Ruben or our CTO want to fix it.
Michael N: So, they intentionally want a separation there.
Dale W: Well, one's in the HR system, and then one is in the finance system, but neither one wants to talk to each other. They just don't get along and they refuse to, and many people have complained about it, but no one wants to fix it.
Michael N: So, is it in your court to fix it now?
Dale W: Well, it lands on me because I can't find the people to put into the scoping tool.
Michael N: When is full rollout on scoping tool?
Dale W: It's rolled out.
Michael N: It's rolled out.
Dale W: Yep. It's going to hit the wall here in a couple of weeks when everybody because October is a big scoping due date… but I mean, it's just a mess.
Michael N: So, you'll see exactly how scalable it is when everyone hammers into it.
Dale W: Yeah. I mean, I'm less worried about that. I'm more worried about the quality of the data going into it because, you know, it blew up our HR system by putting in workday they half assed the master data around it. So we've got garbage coming in. I've got, you know, job profiles that have multiple titles attached to the same profile level. And then I've got, you know, the same title having four different employee grades. I mean, it's just a mess.
Michael N: Was that up to the business line of business owners to fix all their departments?
Dale W: Well, so… while I would love to have a single throat to choke it's, not all their fault because ipg stopped listening?
Michael N: Oh,
Dale W: because they were more concerned as an it project to roll something out rather than get it, right?
Michael N: Yeah. So, without the data being really clean, it makes it… almost a manual process at that point, right? Because they have to go through everything again.
Dale W: Well, yeah. So what, you know, the random PM will say, well, I can't find, so, and you have to start all the way at the beginning, find them and trace them through all of the different systems because it could be they got married and they didn't update them in the right system. It could be that their title changed and they updated in one but not another. It could be that title is not an approved title, which has rate card implications. I mean, you just pick it.
Michael N: And then when omnicom comes in, it's a whole different nightmare.
Dale W: Yeah, do.
Michael N: They have similar titles.
Dale W: One would expect because they're in the same industry that… they should be close. But who knows? I mean, hell, ipg doesn't have the same titles, so.
Michael N: Yeah. From company to company?
Dale W: That's part of the problem.
Michael N: I don't envy you. I mean, that's just a mess. How are you going to fix it? Can we help in any way?
Dale W: No, I'm just going to, there's a, I got a couple of meetings next week with some of the C suite and I'm just going to, you know, show them the data. I say, you know, you guys, I get that, you know, you're spread out, you have different reporting structures now here's, the different orgs, and I get all that, but we still have a business to run and it needs to run on this data. So what's the plan?
Michael N: Yeah… crap. It's a nightmare.
Dale W: And, you know, it's a complicated topic, but, you know, and no one, people just want to blame somebody. They're like, well, you need to just fix it. It's like how in the hell do you expect me to just fix it?
Michael N: You know, hit command F. So.
Dale W: It's insane. This one account person, she got married and she's identifying, she used to have three different names and it's either married or divorced. We're not sure which, but now two of the systems at least have a name that she wants to be known by. But the third system doesn't and she's like, well, clearly, it's a you problem. And I'm like, oh… it's a you problem that's how we're going to play it.
Michael N: Yeah, we actually have that at Domo quite a bit. When people get married… we don't either we don't update the name or we have two names. Lauren's like that, Joe. She's in with two different names.
Joe P: She also specifically asked to keep her maiden name in the system because she didn't want to change. She didn't want any confusion. And then when we moved to workday, it brought over her maiden name. So now she's stuck with two names because we brought in a new HR system. So, yep. So it's not even a name she wants to use, which is funny.
Michael N: I'm sure. She's thrilled about that. I like… her a great deal. She's awesome.

How's it going man?
Nick W: Hey, Danny. How you doing today?
Daniel P: It's going all right. It is going a, OK, man. Yeah, did you have?
Nick W: A good weekend?
Daniel P: Yeah, it was a pretty good weekend, man. It's not getting any cooler, but, you know, in the mornings, they take the one wheel and then the dogs out. So it's all good.
Nick W: That sounds fun. Man. That sounds fun. How fast did your one wheel go? I think I asked you that last time we talked about this.
Daniel P: I think they go up to like 25, but I personally only take it up to like 15 because I'm going to die.
Nick W: Well, and that feels fast when you're that long, you know, you're on the one wheel. Oh, a.
Daniel P: 100 percent man. Yeah.
Nick W: Yeah, cool. Yeah, I didn't really do much. I cleaned out my garage this weekend had some practices that I managed, but other than that, it was just like every other day.
Daniel P: Heck, yeah.
Nick W: What's up, Simon?
Simon N: Nick, Danny, how's it going?
Daniel P: Going? All right, guys. It's going all right?
Simon N: Good to hear you got out a little bit this weekend.
Daniel P: Yeah, man. I can't wait until it cools down a little bit, but, you know, that won't happen until like September. Good stuff.
Simon N: It's in the corner. Man. It's August. I can't believe it's August. It's like halfway through August almost. So September's almost here. Man. You'll be out of the woods soon Q.
Daniel P: Three started baby or at least Q3 for us. Wow. Yeah. But guys pretty good news. So, we finished doing like a… like using like the AI thing. It's pretty cool actually. So, I think like now that we have something, one of the things that we wanted to do is like send it out via email whenever values for a specific dashboard are updated. So that's pretty cool as far as that goes. So, we've been having a lot of fun just playing around with that and seeing what it does, what happens to it?
Simon N: Can you show us that, Danny? I'd be curious to know like what this actual like kind of user workflow looks like?
Daniel P: Yeah, for sure, man. So we don't have it in a way similar… to the exercise where people can just press the button and it shows, but effectively, we have our… we have it associated with this dashboard which just shows like actual spend updated versus like our budget. And so what we have here is this bad boy right here. So basically, we told it to look at it at a specific, like at the dataset that's powering it. And it just shows us like, hey, what's over budget, what's under budget? And then just write like a, really small thing. The next thing that we want to do to this is since this specific dashboard is based on like PDP, we want to test how like the AI thing takes like PDP into consideration. For the users because basically, we don't necessarily want, you know, our like customer success department getting budget and as well as what is it like compensation details on like other departments?
Simon N: I see.
Daniel P: So, I think that's the next step that we're gonna, that we're gonna try to do in order to make it like functional to people other than just, you know, our CEO and CFO?
Simon N: And so, is this only going out to CFO coo, right now? But eventually, right?
Daniel P: Now, it's going to VPS and their and C levels.
Simon N: Okay.
Daniel P: So, within each specific like department, well, not the email but the dashboard, but the dashboard does have the PDP. So let's say like if this Guy Anthony gaskell sees the dashboard, it'll be pre filtered to his PDP stuff. So, I think our next, like I mentioned, our next step is like, hey, can we have the workflow take into account PDP on when it's sending it out?
Simon N: I see. So right now, that email is the same for everyone that gets it, but eventually it would be filtered, correct?
Daniel P: Correct.
Nick W: Correct.
Daniel P: And then,
Nick W: is.
Simon N: there like let's say they want to get to the dashboard? Is there that button on that from the email? If they actually want to go in there? Or is this just a strict text readout?
Daniel P: It's a strict text readout. But yeah, we're going to want to put a like the link to dashboard because this is only going to be sent whenever this dashboard is updated. So basically, whenever we close our books, our actuals for the previous month are posted. And then that's whenever we want to say, hey, here's, what this last month looked like for you. And this is, and this is where all your spending is going kind of situation.
Simon N: And what tools are you using to get that output?
Daniel P: Yeah. So this is coming in from adaptive and workday. So adaptive insights is our.
Simon N: Budgeting?
Daniel P: Planning tool workday, is our ERP.
Simon N: Okay. And what Domo specific tools are you using?
Daniel P: We did this in workflows?
Simon N: Awesome.
Daniel P: Yeah. So we did this in a workflow. Yeah. So this is basically, you know, it didn't really take a lot, just queried the dataset… and then give it the task. So that was pretty cool as far as like how easy it was, it did take us a little bit of tweaking in order to get like the correct values because in our initial attempts, I was just kind of making stuff up honestly or it probably was in making stuff up. But like, I don't know where it wasn't the right numbers.
Simon N: Wow. This is really cool though. I haven't seen, I've seen AI tasked how the email sent but not kind of with this level of detail. Yeah. And the output, this is awesome.
Daniel P: Yeah, it's pretty freaking awesome. Like we really love it so far. We'll get you on.
Simon N: Main stage Domo, palooza.
Daniel P: That'd be cool. I'm down, I just saw the call for speakers. It was like shit guys, we need to come up with a project we want to do this.
Simon N: This is a pretty good start though. Yeah.
Daniel P: No, for sure. Other stuff that we want to do with AI is we… want to do a waterfall basically for our flex for our flex revenue model, but there's a lot of there's a lot of variables why revenue can change from one month to another, including contracts.

Benjamin P: Well, I know you sent me an email. I want to say it was Monday.
Jason J: Probably when I knew that it was like, yeah, I'm not going to have anything. Oh, it was.
Benjamin P: Okay. Yeah, it was that's okay. I've been traveling this week. I went to Utah and I got back last night at one a. M. So, can.
Jason J: you tell me how pioneer day was?
Benjamin P: So, pioneer day was the week before last, and that was something that even though technically I could have taken the day off because all demo employees are supposed to have the day off, I didn't take the day off. I was actually working that day dude.
Jason J: Like our Thursday call, we were laughing about it because I was like, and like nobody took it off but it's like only people in Utah because the first thing I said was, hey, how was your pioneer day? And everybody's laughing? It was like I worked, I did this. I did that.
Benjamin P: What ends up happening is it's the day that we can't we cancel every meeting and everybody ends up working, but actually getting some work done. And so, like we're supposed to take the day off, but.
Jason J: In all?
Benjamin P: Honesty, I think a lot of people actually still work. They're just not in meetings. So, actually… we actually were in, I was actually in meetings a couple meetings on that day. But anyway, nonetheless… I know you said that and I'll just pull your email up. It's not quite ready yet, but it sounded like you have some areas where I can assist, which I would love.
Jason J: Maybe, yeah, nothing quite yet. Okay. Here we go here's. My zeros, but those all just came in today. So, yeah, that makes sense. Okay. So, I mean, I'll show you what it is, what I'm doing and a lot of it right now is just waiting for data to flow in, unfortunately?
Benjamin P: This is in the labs or this is in the SV instance right?
Jason J: Slv, yeah, yeah.
Benjamin P: Slv. Got.
Jason J: It. Yeah. Okay. Here we go. Share. No. Okay. So the story behind all this is as we turn buildings on to have salvage put away where before? No, they were not scanning their widgets to a location. So once it got onto a pallet, maybe it got there. Maybe it didn't who knows it's like you lose actual tracking there. Well, we talked them into looking into putting in scan to pallet where you're actually scanning widget a to pallet one two three. So now you have a full manifest of, okay, this item is definitely associated with this pallet, With that being turned on, it also turned on a new process and category… that we call recycle. Okay. This had been running in Indy for a while, but what happens in recycle is it's I think it's anything under 10 dollars, just goes into the recycle category. But the problem is with how certain things are marked down or handled, in the stores. They come over to us with zero cost. Okay. So these zero cost items were of course marking up 20 percent. It's still zero. We're giving it away. Okay. Well, what Indiana was doing was they knew this and they managed it themselves. The high dollar items. They were kind of pulling off and putting on the turbo. Well, now we turned on scan to palette in two other buildings. Yeah. Two, two more buildings and they're not trained to do all that kind of stuff. So we saw there, hey, there's going to be a problem like more of this stuff's going to be flowing in at zero cost. How are we going to, or what are we going to do? So I, on our end, I was able to pretty quickly associate a cost with all of it. And you can say we're in. We're well over 2,000,000 dollars of cogs that were previously unrealized like we were giving them away. I mean, we weren't counting the cogs we were giving them away. And now I'm working on, the tracking here of like this is the weirdest thing though. I have no idea how it's possible that three days ended up the exact same amount, but we have some issues where how I have this link the data has to, it has to be invoiced before all the data links together. So like this will probably keep going up though, but this is the actual recovery so far that we've recovered in just these 11 days for sure. And it's like 133,000 dollars so far. So basically, I, I'm bringing in another 100 K a week. That, that we weren't before. So it's all like my focus is on this and watching the data flow and figuring out like making or getting all the data in here hopefully quicker and that, so we can even show it off even more because, this turned out pretty huge. I mean this is huge like, this amount of cogs that we were. So this is.
Benjamin P: This is just reporting that shows you the amount of cogs that you're saving?
Jason J: No, that we were losing before we were giving it away. Okay. And not capturing it and not capturing it too, we track our cogs so now we are capturing it number one and we are selling it instead. So we're getting an actual recovery from it that we were not getting before cool.
Benjamin P: And what is, what do you have? Like you have this card now?
Jason J: Right. No, I have this single card yet. Yeah. And one thing you can help me with once I have the data flowing in, right? Once I get the recovery part where I know I'm getting the right data connected because it is being a little weird. You… can definitely help me make tell the story of it better because I'm terrible with frigging dashboards. This is about the extent of it. I'm just not a visual person like that where I don't it's just not my strong suit, the stuff behind all this is.
Benjamin P: And so how does this relate or does this relate to our initial objective?

Ankit S: Yeah. All good. And Shane also invited Mamta. Hey, Shane. Hey, Mamta, Shane also invited Mamta who is one of our senior or principal technical consultants. So, Mamta, I'll give you a second to introduce yourself.
Mamta B: Yeah, no worries. Thank you. Hi, everyone. My name is Mamta bulaki, I'm a principal technical consultant in Domo. I've been in Domo for more than six years now. I help out with implementation just alongside with Shane.
Jesse M: Nice to meet you.
Mamta B: Thank you.
Shane W: Yeah, I invited Mamta and she only can be here for the first 15 minutes. I can't sorry, Ankit, I didn't mean to step over you.
Ankit S: Do your thing, do your thing?
Shane W: But Mamta can only join us for the first 15 minutes and I wanted to chat. I asked her to help me with the sso issue that we were running into. And so I, she looked at the, what we, some of our recordings from previously and kind of has some ideas of what the issue might be. And so Mamta, if you want to kind of speak to that and we can go from there.
Mamta B: Sounds good. Perfect. So you were heading, I don't remember from the recording who was actually showing or sharing the screen? Maybe Jesse, that was you, yeah… you were heading in the right direction. The option that you had to choose was sso, but sso configuration on your side, which is your identity provider side is not configured correctly, right? So that's why when somebody, when you Qlik on that sso sign in button, you're getting an error. So the most, mostly the error seems to be that the entity id field that you have set up in the sso is not correctly getting redirected from your identity provider. So we'll just need to work with your identity provider team or your network security team. I don't know who's who takes care of it in your organization. We just need to work on that application, see and just verify all the details.
Jesse M: Yeah, that's what I figured. Cool. Yeah. And I've got them lined up right now. They're waiting… to put a change in. Once we, once we get a date back on moving, the domain name for instance, to the new company. And I think they have to make some changes in there anyway. So I, if, we can kind of just attack it all at once. Once. That happens. That's what I was thinking.
Mamta B: Yes, perfect. Yes, because when the domain name changes, let's say you're changing from X, Domo. Com to y Domo. Com. They will also have to change it on their site to say, y Domo. Com. So, yeah, absolutely.
Jesse M: Great. Yeah. Sorry. So I think we're looking to do that later in September. I think around the 20 20 fifth or 20 fourth, something like that. So I'll just keep you guys posted.
Mamta B: Yeah. Until then, you can obviously use, the direct sign on option or, you know, whatever option you're using today to log on, right? With the username and password, you can just use that authentication. And when your sso is switched out, then you can test out the idp initiated flow or the SP initiated, the service provider initiated flow, any of those, and it should be working seamlessly.
Jesse M: Sounds good.
Mamta B: Okay, great. Sounds good. Thank thank you for giving an opportunity to just hop on this call and chat with you a little bit. I'll drop off Shane. I don't know if you needed me for anything else. Okay? Sounds good. Take care. Thank you.
Jesse M: Bye.
Ankit S: Thanks, Madhav.
Shane W: Yeah, Madhav's. Great. He's an awesome resource. So I appreciate her jumping on. Okay. So it sounds like, you know, the sso, will adjust that when we update the instance name, and that's still in process. I think, I don't know. Are you guys using any workbench? Or any other? Any other utilities outside of just what's inside of Domo?
Jesse M: No, we, we've been wanting to play around with workbench. Okay? And we had a couple ideas but, we haven't had time to kind of dive into it yet.
Shane W: I ask because like if you have jobs that are running on workbench, we would need to update those as well, but if you don't have anything then that's fine. But I think otherwise, I think we're kind of in a holding pattern until you guys, are ready to pull the trigger, on moving things over.
Jesse M: Okay. Yeah, that's fine. Anything else, when we change that instance? Obviously, everyone's going to have different urls to go to if they've been bookmarking anything, but outside?
Shane W: Of.
Jesse M: that, we… do have some external users, that have, you know, in some publication groups, that link them to specific dashboards… but it's nothing too crazy, right? We can easily send out emails and let them know what's going on. But anything… else we… need to think about?
Shane W: I… think that there is, I know support sent over a list, of things to look at. Okay? Let's see if I can find that email.
Jesse M: Yeah, I might have not scrolled down on that one that's all good. I still have it.
Shane W: Okay. Yeah. There, is that, there is just a few things, to think about, but I think for the most part, you're you guys are in line? I don't see nothing too major.
Jesse M: No, it's pretty late. There's a couple of reports that were, embedded in our portal, but that'll be easy to update too.
Shane W: Yeah, that should just be able to, it may not even change that much because like the, you have like, a, just a… embed id the, so it's pretty, it's not a huge lift to change that. If it, if it does change, it may not change. Actually.

Dan H: Did you see the one thing that I thought would be good for us to tie up on are the new features that were released last week? Did you get a chance to look at those?
Sonja D: Yes, I did. And they broke my dashboard.
Dan H: They broke your dashboard. Yeah.
Sonja D: What it did is it wiped out all of the controls on the dashboard. And so I couldn't figure out what was going on. And finally, I, because I didn't know that something new had rolled out with the controls and the dates and stuff like that. But it just basically wiped out the, what do you call it? The default values. So I had to reset all of the default values in order for it to stop, so or to work. Oh.
Dan H: Man. Well, that shouldn't have happened. I'm sorry to hear that one of the things that I thought you might be excited about it was a big enhancement. There were two that I thought could be really helpful for you guys on that front. One is the ability to have the date variables have a relative date.
Sonja D: Yep.
Dan H: Right. So, you know, yesterday last week, whatever, yep, which I was really excited about. They changed up the, you know, the previous last, you know. So the ability to quickly exclude today or whenever to focus on certain timeframes. But the other one, that I thought might be helpful for you guys with all the filtering that you do is that page filters can now leverage contains functionality which has existed on cards but hasn't existed on pages or apps. And so, you know, that was another enhancement that was introduced lumped in with the filter and variable enhancements. I don't know if you'd seen that one or not.
Sonja D: I did, I mean, I think the way that we designed, this app though, I'm not sure it applies to how we're going to be looking at the data. I'm sure there's going to be a use case for it, but I just, I couldn't think of anything off the top of my head, that we would re like, it wasn't something I would want to redesign what we have today. I think it would be.
Dan H: Sure.
Sonja D: It wouldn't be applicable. I guess.
Dan H: Yeah. The other thing that I've been really excited about and that I don't know if you had a chance to look at the new navigation, did you get a chance to see that?
Sonja D: The new navigation? I don't remember seeing it?
Dan H: So let me show you, I'm going to really quickly switch it off so that we can start from your current state here really fast. And then I'll show you what it looks like. Okay? So let me share my screen here. This is what your navigation looks like today, right? You've got your, you know, if you're on your dashboard, you've got basically your sub menus over here on the left yep your main kind of category headings here at the top. And we introduced the new nav we've had in beta for the better part of a year. We've got a lot of really great feedback and I'm excited to see how they incorporated that if you go into the admin section. So more admin and then under features there's feature management… you'll see new navigation and it sounds like it's not enabled if it were, you would know it. And I'll show it to you here in just a second, but you can enable it for everyone. You can enable it for admins, or you can enable it for specific groups. So if you wanted to just incorporate a small test group, I'm going to go ahead and enable it for everyone and hit save and you'll notice. And again, this is in my instance, not yours. Everything up top that header at the top goes away and we've incorporated it all in this left rail. So the few things that are important to be aware of is this rubik's cube looking thing now that was part of the more menu encompasses everything. So including things that used to be sub menus, right? Like accounts or data flows or a subset of data sets. Everything is now kind of merchandised and directly accessible from one Qlik here. In the feature menu, there's a search up here so you can quickly search for what you're after they've kind of color coded things around different sections of the product. But you can see everything there. You've got your global searches here.

Michael N: Good. How's your week going slow? Has it been a long week? Yeah.
Tracy P: I've been sick, so it's just been dragging for me.
Michael N: Cold or?
Tracy P: Yeah. I guess, I mean, who gets a cold in the summer?
Michael N: It's the worst.
Tracy P: The only thing I could think of is that we had that heat wave where it was like 100 and something plus every day and then it dropped down to like 60 something. So, maybe that temperature change did it, but I don't know.
Michael N: I've been hearing because we travel a whole bunch our team that this new covid strain that's going around is like the least, it's the least risky for hospitalization and stuff, but it's just brutal sore throats, people like it just feel like you got you're swallowing razor blades?
Tracy P: Yeah, that I don't have that symptom. So I don't think that's what it is but I didn't I've just been trying to ride it out but it's been like it started last week. So I'm really on my second week of it.

Joe P: Good morning, everyone?
Michael N: So, Tiva's, not joining us this morning, so we can get started if everyone is here from the ipg side? Yeah, Dale, is matt joining us or no?
Dale W: Not sure we can go ahead and get started though.
Michael N: Okay. So, Dale, you were testing that workaround or fix that we sent over? Is that still functioning? Please say yes.
Dale W: I believe so, Kevin, you made it through the passes, right?
Kevin M: Yeah, this is for the workflow list.
Joe P: Yeah.
Kevin M: Yeah, so far so good.
Michael N: The latest.
Dale W: Piece of chewing gum is holding its structural integrity.
Michael N: We like to hear that. Does that mean Dale that you're okay to continue with your testing today and release or did we screw that up?
Dale W: I think we're going to launch? The big question will be the embed stuff that we left behind and some of the embed versus app studio stuff that we said were on the roadmap and things like that. We should pick that conversation up after everybody gets to take a nap.
Michael N: Okay. How big of a release is it going to be today?
Dale W: Well, we're going to give almost a 1,000 people access to this thing.
Michael N: Okay. Wow. All right. And the reason I'm asking is I'll let Tiva know and… we'll stay on top of this to make sure if any tickets come through, they get routed right away. If anything pops up, we'll let you know on our side and we'll continue to track this as a high priority through today and then through next week. Sure. Joe, anything else on your side for that?
Joe P: No, for the release, no, I'm hoping that everything is in a solid shape. And to Dale your point, the bubble gum, the way of pulling things together on a few places holds. I think we're going to be okay then?
Michael N: Awesome. Anything else? Dale, we should be aware of going through today and going through the release?
Dale W: I don't think so.
Michael N: Okay. Carl, anything on your end?
Karl A: Yeah. So there is an issue with the workflow, but I have a meeting with Tiva later on today, and we're going to have a chat about that.
Michael N: Okay. Excellent, let us know if after that, you need any other resources pulled in and we'll make sure we'll grab those and bring them in. Is it a dead stop, Carl, or is it?
Karl A: Well, we can go without it. It's just related to refreshing a collection at the end. When the workflow runs, it's not working for some reason. So obviously, the collection will refresh itself eventually, but it would be nice if it happens when we want it to.
Michael N: Yeah, no, for sure. I'm sure Tiva can help out with that. I could also grab someone else in the workflows area, if you can't come to resolution with her today.
Karl A: Yeah. I mean, it's just more of these permissions. It's like my bane, right? It's like giving what kind of permissions do people need to run these workflows? I think that we've given them everything they should need. But for some reason, it still isn't working and it does look like it's permissions issue?
Michael N: It's odd. We'll get it figured out for sure. Is that the only issue that you're facing now… or do we have other things we need to work on?
Karl A: Yeah, I think so. Let me just check. You can ask everyone else whilst I just check.
Michael N: Okay. I'll start at the top where I see it on my screen Tracy.
Tracy P: I'm good.
Michael N: Okay. Brendan, everything is good for me over here. Love to hear that, Kevin.
Kevin M: Yep, I'm good.
Michael N: Awesome. Sabrina? Welcome.
Sabrina P: Hello. My issue is with Carl. So thank you, Carl for taking point on that.
Karl A: Yeah, no worries.
Michael N: Okay. Carl, anything else?
Karl A: No.
Michael N: I love that. So, I know you guys have that going on today. I'll update the team, make sure that gets prioritized and gets eyes on it. And we'll look out for anything that comes through… Joe. Anything else for this call?
Joe P: I want to call out or send out reminders or maybe a first time if you haven't seen it for the connection store. So we're getting pretty close to this kicking off. So if you're not registered or if you haven't heard of it yet, I'm putting the link in there.

Fui K: Right? Yep.
Sasha G: Okay. And I'm not sure where we were on that. I think junior… do you have this meeting on your calendar? Do you, or should I just share on my, I can probably just share on my screen cool?
Fui K: I was going to say, yeah, if you're able to share your screen, then, you know, we can take a look at it. Let me take a look go from there.
Sasha G: Get into Domo real quick. Get into… that data set. There. We go. All right, zoom share. Okay. So… over here, you should be able to, can you see our screen?
Shana B: Yes.
Sasha G: Okay. So we've gone ahead and set up the connector. And from my understanding.
Shana B: This was a standard connector, like going through our connector library or you set up the Domo on snowflake integration?
Sasha G: I set up the Domo on snowflake integration. So if we go into data and we go into here into the data warehouse, it's set up right here.
Shana B: Okay. So that, yeah, that is the, okay. I think in the email, you guys said you were using a standard connector?
Sasha G: Oh, yeah. Sorry?
Shana B: Which would have had a different answer. Yeah, I think the one example where you weren't seeing row counts and a change to the last update that's actually expected behavior because it is a view in snowflake and snowflake just doesn't pass metadata on views because they kind of, they don't really exist. They don't have a row count. They're sort of generated on the fly. So, when you said it was scheduled to update daily, do you mean that you had the freshness checks set daily at the integrated?
Sasha G: Level. Yes. Okay. And so only one of these is a view. This one is a view. And so, yeah, one shows zero rows, but this one is a table. It shows it. Okay. It shows the rows but it still shows no history. So I understand that it's checking the freshness, but I guess it just works a little different than the connectors normally do.
Shana B: Yeah. So definitely with the view, we expect the zero rows and last update like that's, just, it doesn't mean that it's not showing fresh data when someone loads a card or when you open the data tab, it just displays a little differently than a connector. I can follow up with my product team, but I think as long as we're seeing like, are you seeing the rows, do they represent what you expect them to show? Like if you load the data tab, that will always send a fresh query to snowflake, regardless of your freshness check settings? Is that lagging like showing data that looks old or it's updating as expected? It's just the last update field that's causing confusion?
Sasha G: Yeah. No, this does seem to be updating. We just don't see any history whether or not there were any new rows added or anything like that, which is something that we kind of rely on. So we can't really see whether or not this ran within Domo.
Shana B: So the way the freshness checks work unlike a connector, so say we had used a standard connector which brings data into Domo and stores it in Domo, that one would run on a schedule. So for equivalent purposes, let's say you put it on a daily schedule. Then every day at say nine am, you're going to see in the history and dataset ran and it has 50 rows or whatever it has. And, you know, yesterday it had 52. And the day before it was 110 or what you know, like you're going to see that history of it running every time. Sure with a dataset using this Domo on snowflake integration, we don't actually run your full dataset at every freshness check interval. Instead, what Domo does is a metadata query on the snowflake side. So we check with snowflake has the underlying data changed, but we don't actually query the entire dataset just some metadata on the last updates on the snowflake side. And we use that to determine when someone loads a card, Domo can cache the data necessary just for the card query. So in your case, we've got what 18 columns in 611 rows, maybe to load the card, we only need two of those columns and maybe it filters down to 20 rows. All right? So we will turn that card, whatever you know, fields are in that card. We'll convert that to a SQL query. And that's what we query snowflake for rather than the full data set. And then if the freshness check says, you know, maybe we're caching things for a day and we've got a day long freshness check and we happen to do our freshness check. And even though we've only cached for two hours, if our freshness check says the underlying data has changed, then the next time someone loads a card even if we haven't cached for your full cache length, we will send a fresh query to snowflake because our freshness check says the data has changed, but we're not going to go and just store new data in Domo because this setup is not storing data in Domo. So we're not going to go update your data tab, for example, every 24 hours just because the freshness checks happen. Anytime you, if you individually like manually went to the data tab, we would send a fresh query so that you can actually see everything in there. But most of your users, they're just interacting more on the front end, right? Loading a card when we're not querying the entire data set from snowflake, we're not sending like a select star over to snowflake and getting everything every 24 hours. We're just getting what you need to load the card and that's how the setup works.

How you doing?
Mat W: Good morning, Scott.
Scott T: How are you today? Not bad. How you doing? I'm doing alright.
Mat W: I'm just driving between a performance event. So I'm just in the car so I can see you, but I just have video off.
Scott T: Yeah, yeah, stay safe. I don't know if Michael had a chance to talk to you, but we were able to get the Domo workbench set up connected to business.
Mat W: Yeah, I talked to him yesterday, okay?
Scott T: Awesome. So I think we have it.
Mat W: That's great. So that is, so that will have, yeah, that's great. So that is all of our current business central. Does that also bring in the legacy data? Scott? Do you know, like does that bring in the pre June first data or just the stuff in the new kind of instance?
Scott T: So it's connected to the business central database. So whatever tables are available in that database, we can bring in now through workbench. So I don't know. Oh, great. I'm not sure what tables are there. So I can't answer that question, but whatever's in that database, we should be able to bring in though.
Mat W: Right. And I'll talk to Michael, I'm on my way to the office. Now, I'll talk to Michael this morning to see like if you're connected to the database, we may just have to go to some like older like so the old tables and they may be in different tables because I know we transferred from an old system to a new system, but I'm sure connecting to both will be easy because once you've connected to one, it should be easy to find the other. Yeah, that's good. Okay. Well, that's great. Listen, Scott, that's got a lot of the data, right? So like,
Scott T: we.
Mat W: have that has almost like the only thing that's not really in there is our like our packing equipment, which is viscon, which we're still trying to get connected. Our labor tracking system isn't in there like priva, and then the last one which is like anything to do with like QA quality assurance. We still have it in like some of it's still being done in excel tables. So I have a list of those that I'll send you and Michael that like I think some of it, we may just have to start a Domo folder and put a file in a Domo folder that constantly gets refreshed. You know what I mean? And grabs as new information gets added and we can just pull directly off the folder.
Scott T: Okay. Yeah. Would that be like on a sharepoint site, a onedrive folder or is.
Mat W: it like a network? I think we can do anything. So you tell me what's the best way to do it? Like I think we would have it typically. We probably can just do it on a sharepoint drive to be honest.
Scott T: Okay. Yeah. So we do have a sharepoint connector. Yeah. As with all of our Microsoft connectors, it's a bit tricky to set up. So, I think with Michael, I mean, I think he's one of your it admins. So assuming that, so the issue typically is that in order to allow Domo access to the sharepoint folder, Domo kind of has to get like whitelisted or that Domo, that sharepoint site has to get like has to allow Domo access to it. And that involves like doing stuff with azure and the, and all of that. So, I can find the documentation for that, but that's probably the easiest way to do it especially if you've got a sharepoint set up and that's easy for your users to access. So, yeah, I'll find that documentation and send it over and then we can get started on that too. You mentioned diskon. Is that the name of the system or is that?
Mat W: It is gone? VISC o N. So it is the, it is the it's like our like I would say, our packing system. So it's the thing that like, it's a conveyor system. We, we have a, I cc'd you on an email with matt doja who is our operations manager. He's having a conversation with this gone and, they, I think have an API. So I have to follow up with matt. I'm gonna have him CC you on an email with them just to see if we can get an API connection with them like this gone and priva, our labor management system are also talking because they are trying to get an API connection with one another. So, I think they both have apis. It's just a matter of how do we get them connected now through workbench to Domo?
Scott T: Right. Yeah. It doesn't necessarily always have to be workbench right? So, if they have an API connection, we can connect Domo using that API connection directly and that can speed… it up a bit… if it's easier for you to get the data into your business central database, then we can always get it there first and then pull it into Domo through workbench. Yeah. But workbench is primarily designed to help with getting like on Prem data into Domo. So data that's not kind of if it's already up in the cloud. Typically, we can connect to it a little easier than going through workbench but if it's on Prem or something that's where workbench comes in handy. So, or if there's like firewall issues, the workbench is able to deal with those.
Mat W: I see. Okay. So those are really like, you know, if I was to say like those are really the three. Once we have dynamics connected, the three that are left are viscon, which is like our packing lines and like it would track like the weight of product moved the, you know, how much product was packed. Like all of those kind of operational KPIs, you know, would come off that Scott viscon would be our labor management system. So that's going to tell, you know, hours worked in various areas of the greenhouse or pack house, right? So that is one. And we have a connection at moochie, which I know is his name, Simon or Simon, like, you know, I don't know who is the who's the relationship manager on this account and also on the moochie account.
Scott T: Oh, Simeon.
Mat W: Yeah, Simeon. Okay. Yeah. So Simeon as the relationship manager, like I'm happy to reach out, to the Domo kind of rep at moochie to get like how they did that kind of connection with priva, but it's going to be the same deal for us because it's the same system. So it's almost like I'd like to almost piggyback on the back of what moochie did to get the same connection here at Kronos, but I don't know if Simeon can give us that or if we need to go to their like Domo rep and have",Consumption Pricing Model,86250.0,Corporate,THECRONOSGROUP.COM,1,Retail,447,$100M to <$250M,Upsell,Blank,Closed Won,Simeon Nielsen,2025-07-30,2025-07-29,2025-07-29,2025-07-30,2025-07-30,2025-07-30,2025-07-30,,0013800001Ms6YZAAZ

I youtubed it. I googled it and I still don't know, right? Okay. So, now I teach him like the next level which is like chatgpt, like talking to it. But yeah. So, I'm thinking about that too. Like, I don't know technology and, my young one.
Sarah C: It's, you eventually just kind of have to get it at some point like we ended up having to get an iPad during covid for it to do a work.
Jaran P: Okay.
Sarah C: So, I mean, it was kind of forced on us earlier, but I mean, the longer you can stay away from it, the better because they become so mesmerized that they, they're non functional adults and then they get a real bad attitude.
Jaran P: I.
Sarah C: mean, I don't know like, because my daughter was, like the first couple of days she would sit and watch me do conference calls just to watch movement on a screen.
Jaran P: No way. That's.
Sarah C: addictive. That's terrible.
Jaran P: Yeah. My son right now, he will like break his back to turn around and look at the TV. If we're watching something or like if I have my phone out and he sees it, he's just like locked in. Yeah, it's.
Sarah C: crazy, but we were like that too. I mean, you're younger than me, but we were like that too with TV like when you get home from school and stuff. I mean, it was just like zoned out and now it's like please watch TV. At least it's 30 minutes long and at least you have to pay attention to a storyline for 30 minutes instead of 20 seconds on a YouTube short, like I'm like please watch TV?
Jaran P: I know, right? Yeah, my memory right now is like terrible because of like tiktok and YouTube shorts and all that stuff. Everything is just way too fast. On top of that, I watch everything on double speed as well, which makes things even worse.
Sarah C: Yeah, that would be very hard.
Jaran P: Cool. All right. Hey, Ivan. Hey, aish. Are we waiting for Simon to join?
Ivan S: We could go ahead and just get started and then just cover progress… and then towards the end, just reserve like five to 10 minutes just to talk about ours.
Jaran P: Sure. Cool. Sounds good. Sarah. I added you to a bunch of dashboards yesterday.
Sarah C: I saw them and I saw that you all shoved them up under middle east.
Jaran P: Yeah.
Sarah C: Yeah. And the middle east, like homepage looks so good now.
Jaran P: Yeah. Okay, great. I'm glad you like it. Okay. So let's quickly. Just talk through it. Any questions though top of mind that you want to just focus on?
Sarah C: I just had a quick question. So like there's three guys from the middle east now invited to their dashboard. When they open up their home screen, do they automatically see the middle east homepage?
Jaran P: Do you mean when they log on to Domo, like that?
Sarah C: Yes, instead of it saying like overview, does it start here? Because I mean, when I open up now, we're going to Canada, I go to Canada, like how do I set a default for a user to immediately start their dashboard?
Jaran P: I think there is a way to do it. I need to look into it. Aish, do you know if there's do you know how to do that?
Aishwarya D: A default landing page, right?
Jaran P: Yeah, yeah, yes, I want them to like the people in the middle east are just when they log on. It's just this page.
Aishwarya D: I know how to set it for all users, but for a specific user group, I'll have to look into it.
Jaran P: Okay.
Sarah C: Okay. Yeah. At this point,
Jaran P: I'm sorry.
Sarah C: Everybody up to their home page is their default. Yeah, because I mean, they're just not getting access to their own pages. And so it's like if we're starting to build that, yeah, I think it would just be easier… but, yeah, yeah.
Jaran P: I imagine it's something to do with their user profile or something like that.
Sarah C: I would assume. So I'll poke around in there. Okay. Yeah, I can have.
Aishwarya D: A look at this one.
Jaran P: Okay. Cool. So, yeah, this is the middle east homepage. It's a little different from the other ones because the other ones have the form comprehensive and simplified, but the idea is pretty much the same. They can just navigate to each page. So when they Qlik, this separate page opens up and this is the homepage for each of those areas. Now, the only kind of difference here or challenge I ran into was the character limit on the title. So I was able to include all the countries in the title that's fine. And Canada has like, you know, Canada brackets, but since it's being nested in these folders, it says it right under. So I just removed it from the title and it just left it here. So I think that's fine.
Sarah C: Looks great.
Jaran P: Perfect. Now, we added the country filter. I think that's the biggest change here. So when there's multiple countries per that region, you have this country filter. So for this one, you'll have it",Consumption Pricing Model,15000.0,Corporate,STAAR.COM,1,Manufacturing,964,$250M to <$500M,Upsell,Blank,2: Determine Needs,Simon Noling,2026-02-11,2025-08-18,2025-08-18,,,,,,0015000000t6GeXAAU

They reviewed the current work, explored data integration options, and planned for the next session to create a more complex report involving data from multiple sources, including an ERP system and an Excel file. Lindsay provided guidance on formatting, filtering, and sorting the data, as well as suggestions for improving the dashboard layout and functionality.","Lindsay G: hi, how are you guys?
Appu C: Hey, good afternoon. Good. How are you?
Lindsay G: Good. Thanks. Do you guys know how many will be joining us on today's? Call?
John D: I'm unsure. I see that Mike and matt are invited, but I haven't spoke to them if they're actually attending.
Lindsay G: Okay. No worries. I believe matt's planning on attending, but let me just go double check the… yeah, he accepted the invite.
John D: This will wait for them.
Lindsay G: Have you guys been told at all about ace… and Domo yet?
John D: I don't believe so. Okay. So.
Lindsay G: My name is Lindsay and I'm your guys' ace account manager. So I hop on calls with my clients weekly to kind of review core product features and new product features that are coming out to help you guys feel fully enabled in Domo, so that you guys are maximizing the value you get from the product. So I'm here to basically help guide you through working sessions and answer questions as they come up. But I am your dedicated resource for that.
John D: So, you're the person to go to?
Lindsay G: What was that?
John D: So you're the person to go to?
Lindsay G: Yeah. So if you ever have questions, if you're stuck on a certain project or anything like that, you could reach out to me and we could hop on a call or I could respond over email, but you guys have a certain amount of hours per quarter. And as far as like the ace department is concerned, we don't really track those hours strictly, we just kind of monitor them. And if you have an excess, we can use those hours to send projects over to our consulting department and they can help you guys build out solutions if you know, it's a bandwidth issue or a more technical solution that you guys are wanting support on. But anyway, yeah, I mean, we're really just focused on making sure you guys have all the resources you need.
John D: Awesome. Thank you.
Appu C: Perfect.
Lindsay G: I think today's call is meant to go over maybe some cards you guys have already started building out.
John D: We've only had one session with Jenna and another gentleman. I forget his name, was it? Alex?
Lindsay G: Alex would be in the consulting team, but yeah, that sounds right.
John D: Yeah. And we kind of just went through the basics of like,
Lindsay G: a card.
John D: Analyzer. Yeah. And I think this one is for visualization.
Lindsay G: Yeah, I.
John D: don't know if you have that same card that we kind of started on.
Lindsay G: So, I'm actually not in your instance. So I don't know what you guys previously worked on, but what we'll do is I'll have one of you drive the session. So bringing up your Domo instance and I'll walk you guys through visualization options and we can talk through some other core product features. But what are you guys' positions at Kronos?
John D: I'm the ERP coordinator, I handle our dynamics system, Microsoft dynamics business central.
Appu C: I'm part of the ERP team, but my title is supply chain analyst.
Lindsay G: Okay, cool.
John D: And I'm the it manager.
Lindsay G: Awesome. So, are any of you like dedicated resources for working in Domo daily or are you guys all kind of hopping in and out?
John D: It's going to be mostly apu and I kind of building the cards for our users here or whatever somebody needs. But I don't know if matt's going to be like having the other departments create their own. I think we're the… everyone will come to us and then we can build cards for that because we know the ERP pretty well and where to grab tables and fields.
Lindsay G: We.
John D: have experience with a program called jet. It kind of works the same way where you grab a table, you grab… all your information in your fields and you can manipulate it using excel.
Lindsay G: Okay, cool. Do one of you mind driving the session today?
John D: Apu? Do you want to drive?
Appu C: Yeah, we could probably.
Lindsay G: Just jump right into it, so we don't waste any time if matt joins. Great. But if not, we can just get a feel for what you guys have going on so far, and as far as like the data that you're bringing in, are you bringing in tables directly from the ERP or where… is your data coming from?
Appu C: The first exercise we did was a very simple card building. What we are currently doing is we have around 50 check reports we need to create Domo cards for it. So we started with a very simple one means all the tables are pointing only to the ERP part. But the next one we'll have multiple data points pointing out to ERP, and also maybe a shared excel file, but that's our next card building session. So the one we already built was a very simple one, but we just add time to complete, you know, the building session. But now today, I believe we can use the same card for visualization.
Lindsay G: Okay. Yeah. Do you want to open up Domo?
Appu C: Yeah. So this… is the demo dashboard. Oh,
John D: we don't.
Appu C: see it.
Lindsay G: Yeah, we're just seeing an empty desktop.
Appu C: Maybe I'm not sharing the right screen.
John D: But yes, we are, we've loaded a bunch of like… static data from our old legacy system that was in CSV files into Domo. But then we also have a connection to our ERP… system using… was it cdata that's pulling it Mike?
Appu C: Can you see the screen? Yeah.
Michael T: It's, cdata pulls the live data, but the nav data or the static data was all just uploaded via excel?
Lindsay G: Okay. Awesome. Yes, we can see your screen. Thank you. Let's go ahead. Can you go to the data tab? Perfect. And then I'm just looking here. Can you go to, if I write on the screen? Are you guys able to see it? Like if I circle here? Yes. Okay, great. So, let's go to etls or transforms? Okay. So, you guys have, looks like Alex has gone in and added a data flow, but it doesn't look like any of you have touched data flows yet, right?
Appu C: No.
Lindsay G: Okay. That's also something we could review that's. Just a mechanism for transforming and joining your tables together. Definitely. Can.
John D: I stop you real quick. Are we recording this?
Lindsay G: Yeah.
John D: Okay. Yeah, I just didn't see if we were or not.
Lindsay G: Yep. I can send you guys the recorded link afterwards. Perf",Consumption Pricing Model,86250.0,Corporate,THECRONOSGROUP.COM,1,Retail,447,$100M to <$250M,Renewal,Blank,2: Determine Needs,Karlie De Vries,2029-04-01,2025-01-22,2025-01-22,,,,,,0013800001Ms6YZAAZ

Abraham M: Hey, Ben. How you doing, man?
Benjamin P: Good. I'm not sure why the meeting didn't yeah.
Abraham M: It's weird.
Benjamin P: Because on my calendar, it says at three o'clock so, I don't know. Yeah.
Abraham M: I have no idea. Hey, and I'll let Greg speak to it more, but we actually have… an slw where you guys signed for additional work. So, is that something you can help us with? Or are you just like more solutioning for us instead of actually doing like new cards or reports?
Benjamin P: Can you tell me a little bit more about that?
Abraham M: I'll let Greg loop you in, but I mean, we had a request where I think he's coming on now, where we needed to redesign one of, our Domo cards or reports or dashboards. Hey, Greg. Howdy, can you speak more about the work that we already signed an slw for? So maybe that's something that Ben's team can help us with.
Greg H: Yeah. So this was to actually build out a dashboard similar to one that we had a third… party team build for us last year. It's just taking data across multiple of our data sets or existing cards and helping us create it like a historic trending view in a dashboard format with like snapshots essentially. So.
Benjamin P: Okay. So you said that was with that third party?
Greg H: Yeah. I forget the name of it. Clearsquare, I think is the name of it.
Benjamin P: Oh, clearsquare. Okay. Yeah. So they're one of our partners and so it sounds like you guys have been engaged with them in the past and you were looking to re, engage with their team to assist with some dashboarding work? Is that right?
Greg H: Yeah. But I guess the question now is like, should we have done that or would this has been an appropriate forum to try to get stuff like that created?
Benjamin P: Yes. So we're here to help in with anything related to demo that you might need. So, yes, we could have helped with that, you know, if you wanted us to. But the goal, one of the goals of this adoption program is to put together a roadmap of how you guys can maximize your value from the demo platform not just today but in the future as well. And so I think that it is, it's good that you're working with them. And I think clearsquare, they're excellent at what they do. We can work in parallel to them so that we can execute on other use cases in addition to what they're doing for you on the dashboarding side. So, yes, we can help in that area. But as we're building out this roadmap, we're hoping to uncover more than just one area where we can help provide more value so that we can work in parallel with them.
Greg H: Okay.
Abraham M: So, can we pivot to you guys then and then put clearsquare on hold?
Benjamin P: Yeah, that's entirely up to you that's your decision to make. I'm not sure where you guys are with that. We're not part of the sales team, Ankit, and will and I are part of the sales team. So I'm not sure where you guys are in that process, but certainly if you guys would like to work with us on that, we would be happy to do that. But I know you guys have worked with clearsquare in the past and so if they already have a familiarity with that dashboard, maybe that's a better approach, but that's entirely up to you guys.
Abraham M: I think maybe it's worth the time. So we do want to bring in the rest of the team to actually start looking through what other areas we want to expand Domo into, so that still can go in parallel. But I think we should pivot and then just see how you guys can help us with the work that we were kind of outlining now because I mean, we did sign the… slw… but nothing has been scheduled yet. And I don't know Greg if you've seen anything from your end, but I.
Greg H: no, I actually had on my to do list to reach out to them today, but if you want me to hold off on that just because I hadn't seen anything, I thought you'd signed it last week and then I thought we would have heard from them this week, like to schedule like a kickoff call or something, but I have not heard anything.
Benjamin P: Well, I'll let you guys speak with Justin about that to see, because again, that's on the sales side, so you guys can work that out. But if you do want to work with us, we're happy to work with you on any use case that you have related to demo that's what we're here for, okay?
Abraham M: All right. So, Justin's out of the office till next week, right?
Benjamin P: Is that what I, yes, yes, that's right?
Abraham M: Okay. So we'll engage them and see how we can pivot.
Benjamin P: All right. Well, yeah. So I think the goal for today is to ensure that you guys are comfortable with the governance dashboard, answer any questions that you may have, so that you can use that to get as much value as you can from that so that we can move on to other use cases where we can help you guys out. So, Greg, do you want to just pull that up and drive? And, yeah.
Greg H: Sure.
Benjamin P: Start, you know, sort of, you know, asking whatever questions that you may have. Will is here. He was the one that was the primary driver of that. And so I really wanted him to be in attendance today. Yeah, no, no, because he'd probably be better equipped to answer those questions.
Greg H: Yeah, no, no. The dashboard itself is actually pretty useful. I think where I'm like just like hitting a mental roadblock is like following it through like the whole process like, okay, we found a signal. We found this, okay, that like… if we can walk through just one like low hanging fruit today and be like, yeah, here's how we can actually now go through and update things and understand the impact of the changes we're making, right? I think I've been a little hesitant to do anything. I'm like, oh, wait, is this gonna, if I change this dataset? Refresh? Rate? Is that like jumping back and forth and they're like, what else is that going to impact, right? Like, right? Because, well, let's just dive in, right? Let me share my screen. Let's just go. Give me one second here. Sorry… where is it?

So I don't know if we need to talk about much more or anything like that, but.
Zachary O: Not really. I mean, that was the big thing is because I was able to pull, but I need to be able to try to test the refresh. So I'm going to be testing the refresh on those two files when I go in. So I'll set up my account. I'll go in with Domo support, make sure that account has access to all the cards that I need. And then I will in our… system, make sure that I go and then try refreshing on both. And when I do that, I'll be able to pull all the logs saying, okay, this is what happened. This is what didn't happen and I'll be able to go from there.
James H: Okay. Sounds good. Does it make sense to lead you since you're like our dedicated technical person as part of our account?
Zachary O: To what?
James H: Like to just be a user inside of our Domo account? All depends? Does that help you?
Zachary O: It helps for instances like this where I need to go and with Domo support, verify that I have access, but then I got to reproduce it as a normal user because Domo support doesn't get anything but full admin go. So it's that, hey, I have to have lesser and just to make sure you're fully aware if I have to change my roles, I will be making sure that I communicate. Okay, I am doing X to make sure that when I go through this, I am reproducing but my personal account will never… be elevated without you knowing if I do some restriction of roles. I'll at least make sure you're fully aware of, okay, in order to test this. This is what I'm doing. But if I ever have to elevate the roles, you will be notified before I ever think of doing anything like that.
James H: Okay. Yeah. And part of the reason why I asked too is like, I know now like the users are no longer like a factor with things and stuff too is for your situation right now is your preferred role for doing this test like participant or editor?

Nick W: Yeah, that's the most exciting part, right? I got some football starting to roll out and we'll have some regular football every week. And, yeah, I trained my boys. I don't know over the last four or five years to really enjoy watching football. And so, it makes it to where they request it on Saturdays and on Sundays.

Now we play each other each year, two again. And so, I try to get to that with those of them both. I would, I think I'm more of a BYU fan than I am a Utah fan.

The discussion also covered cost considerations and the need to establish a structured process for evaluating and implementing AI use cases within the organization.","Chris L: everybody. Good afternoon. I think so far it's just you and, I know… it's amazing that we wind up being the ones here who are early, right?
Casey D: Good afternoon, everybody and happy Friday.
Braxton F: Hey, Casey.
Chris L: How's it going?
Casey D: Hello. Good, good to see you all joining. I am recording just for your awareness, I've been asked to record and then we can distribute this to other folks who aren't able to make it today to reference the content we're reviewing and also start considering some new use cases. At Braxton and Kevin, I saw, and… Scott thompson from the Domo side, I think that's it from the Domo side. If you don't mind, we'll give just another minute or two for some other ups folks to hop in. But while we do so, just some quick context, this is an overview of the Domo AI capabilities that we provided to Ravi and the it symphony team about a few weeks ago. They found it pretty valuable and just kind of understanding what's available now and what the different use cases are and applications for the Domo AI to start figuring out how it can help their products, whether it's the internal operations, reporting and dashboards, and cards and functionality, or the external facing products and services like symphony specifically for symphony. They were looking at like the Domo chats, and to improve the symphony tier two offerings. So customers can come in and ask, you know, ad hoc questions of their data. They're also looking at the auto summarization and insights piece where you can take an app, studio page or a dashboard and ask it, you know, just summarize like what are the important insights and that sort of thing on this page and then auto content building where you can ask AI to actually build a card or dashboard for you just by putting in some descriptors or so. I probably just stole some of the thunder from later from Braxton, but just giving some context and why we ended up with this meeting. Is that again, we wanted to expand to the larger group and audience to go through the demo AI capabilities and really… help you guys start exploring what you can use it for, and what use cases you can solve for. So before we get started, is there any questions or any expectations, call outs? Anything from the ups side?
Chris L: Not from me. No, you had my list, Casey?
Casey D: Yeah, appreciate it. Yeah. So again, we'll let Braxton kick things off here. The kind of the flow or the agenda here is basically to kind of go through, you know, what is the core capability a demo AI offers? What are some of the more specific features and functionalities, what are customers using it for? What's the value they're getting? And then really open it up to you guys to ask questions right there's. A lot, you know, both on the technical piece of this and strategic piece of AI. And then for your individual use cases too if you have ideas that you want to present like Kathy already shared with us. So I think I, what did I set this for an hour? And a half? So yeah, we should have plenty of time again, I'll distribute the recording afterwards and we can continue working with each of you individually or your individual groups to explore these use cases further once we get there. But I guess… Braxton, I'll turn it over to you and let everybody know if it's okay to hop in and ask questions as you're going, or if you just want to get through the content first.
Braxton F: You guys, you guys know me we'll keep it sort of informal and high level and if you guys want to double Qlik on anything or drill down, let me know and we'll kind of cover. So I plan to cover a little bit of the technical. We're not going to get too deep into the tech, but I want you to understand some of the underpinnings and the things that are sort of foundational. And then really we'll spend more of our time looking at what does it look like to build really… cool solutions on top of these AI services that are available? So that will be a lion's share of it… sharing my screen here. So Domo… just like we do with everything we're taking a really agnostic approach when it comes to what models you would like to use and even where those models are hosted. And so what you'll see me use today is primarily a service called Domo gpt which is our privately hosted large language model. We've submitted to the infosec team, all of the information about this model and what it is and where it lives and everything about it. And so I think this is primarily what's in scope. But I want you to understand that we also support you bringing your own models from these other vendors. And so, in the context of SE SX which is hosted in databricks, there are models that you can leverage from databricks or, you know, I know ups has data stored in Google and you might want to use Google gemini or you might want to use openai hosted in azure. And so, I just want to sort of lay the foundation that we are model agnostic. And you can really leverage multiple models in the same instance and have different services sort of running on those different models as you see fit. And if you don't really understand the difference between all these models and things like that, no worries. Because we're primarily going to focus on Domo gpt which again is a privately hosted large language model. They're from a family of models called from a company called anthropic, and it's a series of models called Claude models. And so if you've ever played around with some of the public stuff that's you know, what those services are built on. We have a private version of that hosted in Domo. So that's just some level setting there. Any questions on that? I didn't expect too many there.
Casey D: The next I'm sorry. Yeah. Does this have relation to Claude AI?
Braxton F: It does so, anthropic is the maker of the Claude models and Claude AI is their sort of public facing tooling. And we're using the same foundational models on the Domo backend tuned for different services that we provide.
Casey D: Understood. Thank you.
Braxton F: So the next thing I want to cover again is just some of the tooling in fact, I want to go back and make sure that we… yep, I d",Consumption Pricing Model,630700.0,Enterprise,UPS.COM,3,Consumer Packaged Goods,536000,>=$1B,Renewal,Blank,5: Negotiations,Casey Dorman,2026-01-01,2025-01-08,2025-01-08,2025-08-25,2025-10-02,2025-10-02,,,0015000000Yrl38AAB

How's it going?
Ted S: Good. And you?
Juliana J: It's going well. I keep forgetting it's already Tuesday same. So, it's a, I guess it's a good thing, but it definitely feels like a Monday.
Ted S: Agreed. Yeah, it's been one of those days all day.
Juliana J: Yeah, we've been since we lost today. We've like just had a bunch of 30 minute calls today, so, it's a lot of shifting between things, but it's always good to have a long weekend. So, hopefully you guys had a enjoyable weekend.
Ted S: Yeah, pretty good. Gorgeous weather here too. So, I know you had a worse one. I guess. But yeah, I had a kid with double pneumonia and then, I think I slept like 12 hours yesterday, so I don't know, I'm in a small room with him. Yeah.
Juliana J: Stay away… awesome.
Fui K: Yeah, something's definitely going around. I have, caught something similar over the weekend. And so, similarly, Tyson my, colleague sitting right next to me, they're joking. They're like, oh, good thing. What you have isn't contagious, right? As they, yeah, give me the wink. You know, I'm like, hey, I hope it's not, it should be okay, but, yeah, hopefully you're doing better after some much needed rest. It sounds like.
Ted S: Yeah, you too, hopefully.
Fui K: Yeah, you just cross.
Juliana J: The seasons are changing. It's bound to happen wow.
Ted S: The kids are back in school for one day that's what happened?
Juliana J: Yeah. Huh, school started. I forgot about that. Awesome. Cool. I was just about to say we're just waiting on, will. He is here now? Cool. Hey, will.
William W: How's it going?
Juliana J: Good to see you.
William W: Yeah. Do you guys, do you guys, I know it's the trades and the trades never stop. Do you guys get Labor Day off?
Ted S: Yeah. I was just kidding last week when I said I was making it work.
William W: Hey, Ted, you didn't have to mess with anything over the weekend, dude? No.
Ted S: Took it off. Yeah, back at it today, but yeah, it is throwing me off with it being Tuesday, made that mistake a few times.
William W: Yeah, I'm feeling that too well. Yeah, it's good to see everyone. Thanks for waiting.
Juliana J: Yeah, awesome. So, I know you only have 30 minutes today, so I think we wanted to quickly review next steps on the skills matrix changes. Just talk about where we're at there. And then we can move on to updates and starting to do user acceptance testing on the manning app that's in a really good spot. So I think we're ready to get your feedback there. So, yeah, let's start with the skills matrix. I think that'll be… just a quick conversation. I don't know if you guys heard back from Jacob at BT? No.
Ted S: I don't think I saw any reply back. So I guess I can reply again here. I assume that's the same contact as you would have at this point too?
Juliana J: Yeah, I would think to go to Jacob as well so I can also poke him too… and follow up there just to see so I can take that. Yeah, cool. And then as far as the other changes, Nick, I know we talked about that a bit this morning, but… go ahead.
Nik K: For, for all of the other stuff, what we're gonna do is we're gonna spend some time just looking at the output data sets and essentially map it back to the requirements that HR shared with you, right? Do we have the right data to be able to build it out independently? And I think last time we said if it happens that there is more data required or something is required to modify in the app and we need to get to the code, then we'll put a pin in it and deprioritize it, right? So, yeah, yeah. So I think this week or early next week, we'll spend some time just getting into the data and mapping it back to the metric. So, yeah.
Ted S: And then the other, the only part that I was hoping you could help with is the filtering out. The people who don't work here anymore, don't forget that part that's probably, the bug that needs fixed for the others or future enhancements. Yes.
Nik K: Yes, I have that in my notes, but we're going to add that as a, to do because I had forgotten that. So. Okay.
Ted S: You, you want to make that the first thing you do, we would instantly be better off. So. Okay.
Nik K: Okay. Yeah. Good to know. So we'll start with that, remove the departed employees now. Okay?
Ted S: And I think Ted had the field that he emailed out that drives that. Yeah, between that and the title field that we would be able to filter off of for welders themselves. Yeah.
Nik K: Yeah. Well, and are you good with the skills and any other questions we had there or?
William W: I would… just make sure that we're all super aligned on what the expectations are on the skills matrix. If what you guys need is manipulation to the app, then it is, and we can't get a hold of BT. It is rebuilding, which is not a problem. If what you guys need is like to leverage the data or make small changes that HR can pull off of. We can do something for them with the data in the back end without having to rebuild. So, I just want to give you guys the confidence.
Ted S: Yeah, no, I heard you last time. I think what I said and I still believe is to be true, is that, so so long as you can get the reports from the data and I think you mentioned adding those onto a new tab to see, you know, kind of the same data, just different views of it. We don't need you to rebuild it. But if you get into it, you realize, hey, to do that, I have to rebuild it, then let's cross that bridge when we come to it. So, yeah.
William W: I looked at the back end. The data, is looking fine to me. It would just be aligning with you guys that what I'm seeing is what I'm what's there, and that I am accurately attributed or like a metric mapping like, hey, yes, this does mean that I can go through the app and figure that out myself. But I want to make sure I'm super aligned with you guys. So no matter what we need out of that, I feel super confident that we'll be able to deliver, if contact with BT is an issue, like it's not a blocker for us do.
Ted S: You need us to look at something with you separately? Or what are you saying by the agree part of?

Phil S: Yeah. Hey, ridge. Great to meet you. And good morning.
Ridge F: Same here. How's everything going?
Phil S: It is going pretty good. Yeah, just to introduce myself, I'm Phil Stewart enterprise account executive here at Domo. Been here three and a half years or so. I've been working with the home depot team as a customer for close to three years now. Actually, I think it'll be three years officially. As of January. I'll actually be on site at the headquarters there in Atlanta Tuesday, but yeah, I've really enjoyed working with the team and excited to really excited based on your background of, you know, really making sure that, you know, it spend is optimized. So, yeah, I'm particularly excited to talk with you. But, yeah, ridge, I'd love to hear a little bit more about yourself and your role within home depot too.
Ridge F: Yeah, sure. So, I've been here at home depot. It'll be 20 years next week. Wow.
Phil S: Congrats. I spent.
Ridge F: most of that time in a technology finance team and have managed everything from portfolios and labor and projects to most recently, I was doing all of the non labor stuff, cloud software, all of the incidentals around travel training, that kind of stuff. And about seven months ago, well, really about two and a half years ago, we started what I'm now calling finops lite, okay. Trying to do that from a financial perspective. And about seven or eight months ago, our CIO at the time decided he wanted to move it over into it, okay, and really start doing what we're now calling real finops. It's a, you know, our finance friends are still a part of it, but it's really about establishing governance and guidance and creating the culture of everybody needs to care about what we're spending and what your contribution is, and the value we're getting from it. And so that's where we are now. And quite honestly, we're focused on cloud and software right now, but we'll be adding in data centers by the end of the year, data center, databases, probably on into next year. We'll add in networking and telecom. So it's just kind of making this a, I don't want to say baby steps, but we're just trying to get our hands around the things we know and make it more visible and give that transparency to what we're spending and what we're getting out of it. And then we'll just expand from there.
Phil S: I love this initiative, I can give you some like outside validation. I have, I guess a biased perspective. But having talked to so many people inside of home depot, one of the things that's always kind of shocked me is like, well, how many different ETL tools that home depot is paying for? Like how many different of all of these systems and they're so siloed from each other and I've seen the real pain that it creates because mostly I interact with the business unit teams, right? And I can give you just again validation from that side that's a worthy initiative where there are tens of millions of dollars to be saved, you know, inside of home depot?
Ridge F: I'll tell you one of the biggest things that it's almost too huge to attack, but you have to at some point and that's our database structure.
Phil S: Yeah, you.
Ridge F: Would just be blown away by how many databases we have, how many are connected to each other? There's connecting points to everything. But then how many we've got that never get touched or have duplicated data across all of them. And, and yeah, we actually had to, I don't know if you know, Jonathan Forrester or not, but we actually were working with him and trying to get some of that initial data and we brought some outside help in and the response was like, my God, this is a freaking disaster and it's kind of the same story we've done with our cloud environment, right? We've been in cloud for a decade now, but when we first started moving over and migrated our online space into the cloud, it was wild west for lack of a better word. Everybody's just going to do what you need to do and cloud first and damn the cost, right? Just go get it done. And unfortunately, I love my it friends but they haven't always been the most fiscally responsible. So they go, they've got a task to deliver, not necessarily a budget to stick to and that is a very bad combination because, and while we need to deliver whatever the business needs, what the customer requires, there's… always more than one way to do it. And we've always opted for the, you know, the, what they call it the golden triangle where you can either have it fast, high quality, fast.

Greg H: Right? I'm just trying to think if there's any way we can get approval ahead of his, like I want to get moving on it. Like I get asked like every day, like how's that going? I'm like it's we're sort of playing ping pong with this sow. I'm just trying to figure out if there's a way since Eric's out for like another four or five days like he's not back until the middle of next week. I was just seeing if there's anything we can do.

But one of the reasons is because I've been putting out fires and one of them was a Domo fire from this morning and it was in relation to our workbench and I don't know if you know much about problems with workbench or not. But the long and the short is it just lost its authentication. All of a sudden, none of our data was populating and I logged into our server and I'm looking at the workbench and it was blank. We had never configured it. And I'm like where's all the stuff, years of work. It was like it never existed. And then I looked into the logs and I see, okay, there's some bad requests, HTTP requests going on. So I googled that and it's like, oh, check your authentication. And sure enough, the workbench just wasn't authenticating anymore. And I was like… I've never seen this before. And then some people were like, oh, yeah, that happened to us. We had to rebuild all our jobs. I was like, oh God, I don't want to have to do that. Unfortunately, I was able to get it to re, authenticate and everything popped right back in. But I was like, what caused this? And how do I know? So the issue is I get alerted if a job fails to run. But in this case, I wasn't getting those alerts because it's like they didn't exist. And so I was like, what's happening? So take a look. Yeah, that's wild. I've never heard of that. Yeah, it was, did you catch that? Yeah, Ben, I can. So that was my fire this morning. When I was going to spend some time looking at our project, I ended up spending about an hour and a half digging in and figuring out why our workbench had cleared out. At first. It was just loading. I'd go to it and it would just load and it was never pulling anything back, right? And then… I was like, oh, is it corrupted or something. So then I tried to authenticate and I authenticated myself and it was blank and I was like, okay, well, that makes sense a little bit because I didn't I never set up the jobs. They're set up under a service account. Then I authenticated it as the service account and they all came back. I was like whew, but I was having, a mini panic attack like all of our, because I read like yo, stuff's backed up. You can get it, but it may create a new job id and then you have to redo all your cards to point them to the new data sets because it's like a new, that would be a nightmare. Yeah, exactly. I was like, oh God, please, I don't want that. And like I said, fortunately, it didn't come to that. I was able to get it re authenticated on the service account and everything just popped back in. But yeah, we were essentially, nothing was updating for like 12 hours not the end of the world, but I didn't get any alerts. Like normally in the morning, I'd see an email like, oh, this job failed to run like it, you know, it errored out but I didn't have any of those because the jobs just didn't exist, right? It's like it wasn't even trying to run them. So, yeah.
William W: I think there's a way to create a second trigger outside of the workbench. But I think that's besides the fact like I.

Casey D: Everybody. Good morning.
Shelly V: Morning, Casey.
Casey D: Hey, Shelly, Scott, John, Ravi, hi.
Ravi K: Good.
Casey D: Morning.
Parsa N: Hello? Good morning.
Casey D: Really quick before we get started. So I don't have an exact date yet, but we're supposed to be releasing new features. We have new feature releases. I think used to be quarterly. Now, I think it's six times or so a year. There was originally supposed to be one in July but it got pushed back as we were still testing and finalizing some new changes. But in my recap there's a link for the new products page in the Domo website. Actually, I can paste it in the chat, but basically, there's… always a handful of features as we continue to innovate and enhance our products and tools. So if you see anything, let me know if you need a deep dive into anything new that's coming out. Usually when you log in to Domo for the first time after these feature releases have been released, you'll see kind of a prompt window pop up in the bottom left corner of your instance and you can Qlik through and it'll describe what the feature release is, what it does. But again, if we don't talk about it on our next status call or if you have any questions more immediately, just let me know we can provide a deeper dive… because I keep catching wind of these new features… that are really important and helpful. I know a lot of our focus right now is AI and workflows, automation, and app studio, and those sorts of things. So again, as you guys are continuing to build and innovate and iterate on your solutions in Domo, let me know if any of these new features that come out later this week, I think it's later this week. I don't know Braxton or Lucy. Have you guys heard any specific dates or times? If it's not later this week? It's definitely next week. They're coming soon. But yeah, let me know if you have any questions. And then on one of these status calls coming up, we can also review some of those features in more detail if you'd like… as we get started today. Just a quick reminder again that we have this call separated into two parts. First part is basically just general updates, questions, requests, review of issues, that sort of thing. And the second half hour is dedicated specifically to technical open office hours for Braxton and Scott thompson to address anything that you're working on or take a look at anything that needs a pair of technical eyes to help solve. So with that in mind, anybody can start any questions, call outs updates for the Domo team today that we'd like to address.
Ravi K: I'm good from my side, Casey.
Casey D: Okay. Sounds good. Robbie, just quick updates from Robbie's side. We did have some Domo training scheduled for some new users that has coming up. And usually these private instructor led sessions allow up to 15 users. So I don't know Robbie if you have any open seats for others to join as needed. But the basic sessions that we're targeting this month and I'll include this also in my recap on the days and times, but the training is data connection bootcamp on the nineteenth of this month, data transformation bootcamp on the 20 first of this month and data visualization bootcamp on the 20 sixth of this month. So again, I guess if you guys have any buddy that might benefit from that, reach out to Robbie, and hopefully I'm not throwing you under the bus, Robbie, if you already have too many people already scheduled for these, but I know we did talk about inviting other people before, so.
Ravi K: No, no, definitely. I'm looking if there is any opening seats. Definitely. I will open up for everyone. I'm working on the filling those seats. I'll let you know the other team members and thank you Casey and Jack for helping us to schedule the trainings.
Casey D: Yeah, no, yeah. Keep bringing them our way. So, yeah, you guys have four training, private instructor training sessions available till the end of the year. But there's you guys have unlimited public training sessions with a demo instructor. Just keep that in mind or we have a huge library of online modules too for, you know, demo certifications like the online self paced content that you can be trained for just about everything and anything? Thank you. Ravi. What about you, Parsa? Is there anything we can help you with either as part of just general demo account updates or office hours after this portion?
Parsa N: No, I'm okay. Right now. Thanks.
Casey D: Okay. Did you ever end up kind of getting more figured out in terms of those workbench jobs that were stalling out?
Parsa N: Right. No, all those issues have been resolved. So we are okay, you know, eventually I may need help maybe figuring out if I want to design or create new things. But for now status quo from Todd is pretty much okay.
Casey D: Good deal. Just while we're on your… international air freight subject Parsa. I know we had that AI overview last week and one of the things that Todd had called out specifically as a potential use case for you. And that AI group was the forecasting and predicting on time deliveries. He thought that could save days worth of time in delivery operations. Yes.
Parsa N: Yeah, definitely. It is definitely a good like a proactive type of thing that would tell us, hey, these shipments are at risk and it could help us to save and improve our time in transit.
Casey D: Yeah. Let us know once you're ready to get started with that, we can start with just a POC. We do have to run it through Colette and Noman here just to get the fit for use readiness assessment, the security questionnaire and all that. But other than that, we can set up a POC instance and kind of qualify that before using any credits or before putting anything into production. Thanks. And that reminds me, Robbie, did you, we sent back the questionnaire for you and your use case. I think that should be in the ups hands at this point. So as far as next steps, I think as long as there's no other further questions, everybody checks out with that questionnaire, just let us know when we can schedule a call to go through objectives and requirements of the use case.

The team agreed to prioritize the forecasting app project as the first deliverable and continue investigating data entry solutions, with a follow-up meeting scheduled in a week to discuss the options.","Keaton M: hey, Scott.
Scott T: Hey, Keaton. How you doing?
Keaton M: Good. How are you?
Scott T: I am doing well, thanks. Looks like it's just us today.
Keaton M: All right.
Scott T: Excuse me. Okay. So what I was hoping to do well, I guess first of all, hi, how was your weekend?
Keaton M: Good, good. Good. How was yours? Yeah, you.
Scott T: Know it always seems too short, but that's all right. I'm actually taking a four day weekend this weekend. So, I'm looking forward to that. I'm gonna go see my mom in st Louis, so.
Keaton M: Oh, good. That should be fun. Yeah. How were you growing up?
Scott T: Yeah, I grew up in the st Louis area, yep, and then met my wife at college and moved to Chicago after we got married. So, yeah… I'm trying to find my notes here one second. So, I think what I would… like to do on today's, call is walk… through. I think we can have kind of two different work streams working around this forecasting app, right? And so, I think that the… first… piece and I'll share my screen. The first piece would be, can you see my screen first of all? Yep, okay, kind of taking, let me move all these other windows out of the way, taking the app that you've already developed, right? And trying to kind of reimagine how data is entered, right? And so you had mentioned a data product that you guys purchased that you're planning to kind of build into this. So it's more of a grid like data entry system. We can explore that option. We can explore other options of like just data entry, whether it's you know, having splitting it up into like, you know, we can still keep this visual app on top with maybe having like a separate card that's more data entry focused or something there's other options we can explore, but I think that's one path forward. We can take while we're working through this because obviously, what I don't think we want to have happen is say, okay, we have to wait until we fully replace kentone to make any progress on the forecasting app. I don't think that's required because as long as we can take, and create an alternative for the kentone data eventually, and get it into the same format that kentone's feeding it to Domo in now, then we can just swap out the data sets when we're ready and people can use an improved forecasting model, or methodology quicker, while we work on the kentone replacement in the background. So, okay, good. So, I think that will be kind of one work stream we work through. And, the other side to that is kind of what I wanted to dig into more because I feel like this piece, I have an understanding of what needs to be done. I know it's a lot of work, but I feel like, I understand that part. What I don't know necessarily is like… that kintone piece. So I was hoping that we might be, oh, hi, Sam. I see you joined the call too. I didn't know that was just going to be the two of us today. So, I didn't know if you had anything you wanted to go over, Sam, before we dig into kind of the technical side of things or if you're just here to listen?
Simeon N: I had a free hour and saw this, right? I'm just going to make sure, you know, you guys aren't you know, dangerous or anything, breaking anything and dumb up, you know,
Scott T: checking up on us. All right, don't.
Simeon N: Mind me, don't mind me. All right?
Scott T: Okay. No, that's great. So where I would like to take the forecasting thing eventually though is, you know, there was a mention of like when this was in excel, there was a separate tab for all of the customers and that part was kind of a pain to deal with. But what was like about that was that as forecasts were adjusted as numbers were called in, there was a kind of real time estimation of how those numbers were going to deliver a gross margin profile for that customer. Is that right? There was like a summary up at the top that kind of showed the total margin, right? And that was a piece that Perry really liked at least that's my understanding of it. And then we went to kintone and we lost that ability, and then we went to Domo and we've lost the ability to enter multiple products at once. And so to Perry, like it's getting less and less useful to him, right? So, yeah, I would like to get this to a place eventually where as they're entering their quantity values in the forecast, it is also presenting… that margin profile information as well. I don't know how much effort that's going to take to get there, but I'm hoping that we can try to March towards that so that we have the functionality Perry's looking for.
Keaton M: Yeah. So.
Scott T: You don't seem optimistic?
Keaton M: Well, okay. I was just going to just add to that.
Scott T: Yeah.
Keaton M: We specifically with the forecasting we used to actually just have like a, it… didn't… even have like that margin stuff in it. It used to just be a sheet that just had like basic item information and you'd put in your numbers, right?
Scott T: Yeah.
Keaton M: And what I'm sure Dave was talking about and what we've talked about was more the business planning side of it where it had the margin stuff. So I don't know if the, it's tough to say if we should.
Scott T: I see what you're saying. So you're saying maybe it's better to have like a forecast entry system where it's just focused on quantities. Yeah, that's all we're dealing with. We don't care about the pricing or do we care about the pricing at that point? Do they just simply say here's our like, I guess where I get confused is where do, where does the variation in pricing happen? Right? So like my understanding is if I'm doing something for Lowe's, I don't know why I always pick Lowe's but it's way down here and I don't know what your product numbers are, what's a good product number to pick for Lowe's you.
Keaton M: know, do the four, one, two five?
Scott T: Okay. I would love to, I know you guys apparently just know what all these numbers are. I would love to like have a, this is a griddle sort of thing, but that's all right. If you guys know the numbers and we can leave it like that. Like, so, like… if I'm going to Lowe's and I'm filling out this forecast, right?

Fui K: Oh, yeah. No, we see it on our site too. We're on zoom then we're on meet, then we're on teams. And then, yeah, there was an old one called BlueJeans back in the day, like it's just weird all the different virtual ways to collaborate, right? Exactly. Well, we appreciate you hopping on. I think we have everybody from our side, we do have one new face that we'll have when we kick it into introductions, but is there anybody else, Preston from your side? I think just for this intro, right? Seeing if we're going to just.
Preston F: Yeah, I think so. Just me and I know John was on the invite, but I'm not sure if he responded.
Fui K: Okay. Got it. No worries. We can just dive on in and then I can send him the recording and any follow up notes as well. Yeah.
Preston F: Sounds great.
Fui K: Awesome. So today's outline or agenda, I'm just going to do a quick snapshot of the Domo account team supporting you and the extended, you know, departments for the church. And then we'll dive a little bit more into the conversation that we had. I know it was very high level, right at lunch last week with truman and Doug and I, but then we'd love to just get a little bit better understanding of the current state, understanding the partnership, right? With Google and our relationship with Justin and team, right? To see exactly from a value standpoint, where we could help drive value for you and the extended organization. You know, I think many of us on the Domo side, I think majority are personal investors, right? Of the bigger impact, right? And mission of the church. So, and then from there, we'll determine next steps. So anything that I may have missed or hopefully this aligns with, you know, based off of our previous conversation last week?
Preston F: Yeah, this looks great.
Fui K: Awesome. Perfect. So I'll kick things off, won't have truman myself or Doug give a intro as we met last week, but I will give some time over to Shana Brennan, who is your assigned solutions engineer. What that means, right? Is I like to call her the brains of our operation or team. But, yeah, Shana I'll give a couple minutes for you to intro yourself.
Shana B: Yeah, absolutely. Preston. Great to meet you. So like fui, said, Shana Brennan solutions engineer here at Domo. So think about me as kind of that technical counterpart to the account team. So, you know, will it, Domo? Is there a feature that we don't know about here's? A problem. We're trying to solve? What kind of functionality does Domo have that could help us get there? You know, I'm here to help answer those questions. You know, what's possible in the platform? And I've been with Domo for over three years and prior to that, I was a Domo customer. So I was leading a bi team and used the platform for many years and obviously liked it enough to come over to the Domo side.
Preston F: Yeah, right. Nice to meet you.
Fui K: Yeah. Nice to meet you. She is based on the east coast, the northeast, but she will make it out here occasionally in salt lake as well. So we'll make sure to break bread in person as we're able to.
Preston F: And we won't hold that against her at.
Fui K: all break bread or we'll hit the gym, right? Yeah.
Preston F: Yeah.
Fui K: Two additional things that I wanted to call out from this slide. And John wicker and the rest of the team as we meet with them, we'll let them know as well. Number one, you have assigned resources assigned folks. It's not just some random Joe schmoe, right in timbuktu that's just like, hey, Domo, you know, really values the church, no, you have individuals who are dedicated to make sure that as we have conversations that, you know, we deliver. And number two, from a commitment standpoint, any resources questions you have, this is a few folks on our side. There are other leaders and other resources assigned as well, but just wanted to paint that picture. So we'll now transition. I'll turn it over to truman to dive into the architecture. Again. Going back, I think John wicker was a part of some of the previous conversations, right? Of Domo, understanding the layout, the relationships, but we'll kind of go into the history of like what we see from a data architecture standpoint. And then we'll wrap up with Doug from the Google side and where the value is overall. And then we'll dive into more of the discovery in Q. A. So any questions up to this point? Preston? Nope. I think that sounds good.
Truman B: Awesome. Well, Preston, as we go through this, I'm happy to just kind of paint that 30,000 foot view, right? So if you have questions or if it's around capabilities or anything, let me know. Just trying to really give you the high level view. We can go down into any sort of rabbit holes we want as time continues. So as we look at like the traditional modern, like the traditional data stack, this is traditionally what we see all the different sources, whether they're cloud on Prem data lakes warehouses applications. There's all the different sources. And usually customers are obviously trying to access all those store them in a single source or multiple sources and then model and prepare them for the business to use, right?

Simeon N: Oh, man. We were on with a customer earlier today and he went to the Ryder cup and he's like, I loved it but I'll probably never go again. It was a lot of effort, a lot of work but it looked awesome. It looked fun.
Dave A: Yeah. It was a fun weekend to watch it. All all the crap shall go down.
Simeon N: Yeah… almost snuck it out.
Dave A: Yeah, but.
Simeon N: Now, it seems like there's a lot of aftermath going on now, which is pretty wild to watch.
Dave A: Yeah. It's kind of crazy. I will say though. I did watch the video with Rory's wife and I thought she was being a little baby. It looked like the cup was empty.
Simeon N: Yeah, I was laughing because we were on a plane and it was on and it was right after Bryson finished his round and he's just all passionate and just pumped up and they're like you look a little bit emotional why he's like, I just love my country. I'm like, wow, what an awesome answer. He's a legend.
Dave A: Oh, that's funny. Well, I just emailed all of you… just a file quick that says, so I went out and met with Jen. She's my new boss… Domo was a major part of the discussion and we did have their analysts there. It was head of their analyst team and he, you know, of course, he's like, yeah, yeah, yeah, no, like Power BI will do that too. Made a few comments like that. And then he showed Power BI and everybody in the room was like, hey, there's no argument that Power BI is not capable of doing this but it's just not as clean and beautiful and user friendly as Domo. So, and that was said by Jen. I will say that based on the emails you're getting Simeon, it sounds like.
Simeon N: it sounds.
Dave A: like there's some cost pressure from the it department on the weber side, so I can't control that. But my summary of this is I want to win on features and benefits and enhancements that we're doing right now and we're competing against cost and on that, you know?
Scott T: And you,
Dave A: guys can drop price all you want. But like I think we got to compete on features and usability and ease of use.
Scott T: I think when you look into cost as well, I mean, Simeon's probably way better at communicating, I'll just let him do it. But I mean, there's more to just the Power BI, visual side of things that Domo's doing on the background, right? And so, to compare cost to just what Power BI does to all of what Domo does, I do think you have to look at more of the features of what you're getting and not just like the visualization layer. So I'll just,
Dave A: well, from what I saw, it was garbage. So I don't want to use their visualization layer, whatever that's just me.
Simeon N: Yeah. So I did meet with Tracy yesterday and I tried to just help him kind of understand because we've got blackstone, which has Domo and Domo really can do a lot of that majority of the data pipeline and the processes that the weber's probably doing over there as well. Weber has snowflake, and they have Power BI, right? And I tried to articulate like how Domo would fit with a snowflake and how they're you know, complimentary, naturally, Power BI and Domo are a lot more competitive in, you know, the functionality that we offer, but there is a whole heck of a lot more. And this, I mean, I bleed blue, right? I'm not a BYU fan, but I bleed Domo blue and it's there's just a lot more that Domo as a platform can offer you aside from just visuals. And so like I think you're right? Dave, where we win with that. And so, however best we can help support and help you position that to the business. I told, I also told Tracy there's no, like I know that we're in this phase where weber and blackstone are trying to figure out, you know, which processes are married and merged, and how that looks. And there's no issue with providing access to the Domo platforms or weber, whoever wants access, whoever wants to see things in Domo and begin to explore and have fun and start to build there's access to Domo. It's just a matter of how you guys govern and restrict that or promote that access and how you want to, you know, not muddy the water between or blur the lines between blackstone and weber. But over the next year or so, as you guys are kind of working out what the future looks like and reporting over there, Domo, you have access to it from a just a, you know, user perspective, there's no restriction there.
Dave A: Cool. Well, the file that I sent to you, Jen has been employed at three places. She's used this report in all three. She demanded that it be verbatim copy of her last two. And so, Jenna, I think it would be who of us to like dive into this and create a dashboard as soon as possible and just get ahead of this. I think that's an easy quick win. The other things is just like talking through where our focus points are, is, I hope that we're I hope I've been clear on the like what I think the wins are for Scott. I think it's in that realm of forecasting and pricing and Jenna, you and, I think it's like getting to app base as quick as we can. One of the things that I met… with Jen on and we talked about was she agreed, she's like, yes, we need one design language to go forward for both brands.

Dylan C: We've seen more.
Signe P: Brent, I think you scheduled this meeting. Do you want to get it kicked off? Or do you want me to do that?
Jordan K: Yeah.
Dylan C: Well, happy to do that. Dylan, is Sam joining us today? I don't think so. Okay.
Signe P: And I think we did that by design. Honestly. I think we wanted to run this by Dylan first. We want to get your feedback as we're trying to go through some iterations on the solution. And so, before we present to Sam, we wanted to get your feedback and make any changes that we need to on our side. So that was kind of by design.
Dylan C: Okay.
Signe P: If that's okay?
Dylan C: Yeah, that's fine.
Signe P: Okay. I'm sorry, Brian, I think I just kind of took over a bit with that. So, Jordan's been working with our internal team to put some stuff together. So, I think he'll take over the meeting and kind of walk you through some of the things that we've put together, please let us know your insights, thoughts. If we're getting closer to the mark, things that you would like to change or update, we're just, you know, we really want to get this right for you.
Dylan C: Okay.
Jordan K: Yeah. And just getting this pulled up one second here on my end… and I guess one thing… Dylan that we did ask and I don't I never saw anything come across but was hoping if possible, maybe get a peek at what you guys have done with Power BI in the first draft. I was hoping to make sure I was headed down the right path with kind of coming up with something that was art of the possible. I don't know if you feel comfortable with that, if there's if we want to take like maybe the first like three to five minutes and just kind of walk through what you have there.
Dylan C: The only thing I have in that regard is just reports. Otherwise everything was talked in concept, okay? And what they're able to do. I don't know if the reports would be helpful at all.
Signe P: And maybe understanding Dylan a little bit. So, at the current stage, we know that this is a big priority for folks. Is this something that's so, has this already been built up by Power BI, or is this something that you're still going through the concept with that site as well? And you're trying to just determine like if doma can do it or if Power BI can do it? Let us know how this decision making process is going.
Dylan C: Yeah. I mean, we don't so we have a scope of work that our consultants have given us in regards to moving forward with that. We haven't due to budgetary reasons right now. We haven't moved forward with it. And I anticipate that we will within the next fiscal year. So the nothing's been built yet. It's more like it's the proof of like that they can deliver and that they and we have like the scope all ironed out.
Signe P: And maybe through this conversation, and as we build this, I don't know if there's things, are they able to check off all of the things that I don't know if it's the same excel sheet that you gave us and they're able to do all of those things or if there's anything that they're missing that we can make sure that we do. How does that look?
Dylan C: No, they're able to do it. Yeah, it's I mean, it's mainly the broadcasting piece that… they're able to do and they have.
Jordan K: It, is that the custom schedule?
Dylan C: Yeah, scheduling. Yeah. When I say broadcasting, it's just the term we use because it's what it's called within our, the tool we're trying to replace. But yeah, it's the automated scheduling of reports in PDF and excel.
Jordan K: Yeah. And that's both like subscribing to like your historical reports as well as users being able to go in and create their own custom reports, correct? Is that right? Yes.
Dylan C: Yes, exactly.
Jordan K: Cool. So I'm happy to share what I have, right? This is kind of what we were thinking is like, hey, like with 20 to 40 hours of some work like HTML and CSS work, like we could make like with our campaigns app and like embedded reporting. I think we felt pretty confident we could come up with a really good solution. Now if we want to take that one step further and have more of like a custom pixel, perfect more streamlined version, right? With workflows that would kick off a bunch of the different like portions and have this work exactly how you guys want it to like just kind of art of the possible. And now I don't have all the buttons working. So a few things like still more of like concept at this point. So just throw that out there. And, but let me go ahead and I'm going to share this window with you… here. And let me figure out how to minimize all my zoom controls because I'm working off just my laptop window here. So this is, and this, I got two examples. One is kind of a report scheduler with some legacy reports and building out custom reports, right? Not specific to, the traveler hospitality industry. But I think maybe give you an idea of, you know, what this, you know, potentially could look like, right? And so like very high level, right? Like, and I'd probably change this layout a little bit if I had a little more time but showing like, hey, what reports have I subscribed to? Right? Or do I have scheduled, right? I've got, you know, the monthly review, a quarterly analysis and a weekly report that I've kind of subscribed to. I've got maybe some legacy reports down here that you've traditionally had your customers get that.

Jason J: have fun with Joe flacco with no offense. Oh, my.
Michael D: gosh, we already see how that.
Jason J: works. And your o, line is worse than ours. So good.
Michael D: Luck, there was a funny Meme, I saw on Instagram. It was from the movie old school where they go pick up the Guy blue and he was supposed to be Joe flacco. It was Zach Taylor and chase going to go pick up Joe flacco who was blue? I was like, gosh, oh.
Jason J: That's great.
Michael D: We're in for a wild season like the season just started.
Jason J: I know. And then on top of it, it's like then, like Baltimore traded o, way?
Michael D: Huh. He.
Jason J: Was the number one pick. And then late last night, we trade Greg newsome for another quarterback with Jacksonville.
Michael D: Which quarterback, what?
Jason J: Is going on?

Phil S: Okay.

Michael D: They, they've passed on their problems to Cincinnati. All right. Let's see. Yeah, Zach declined. He's out of the office.
Jason J: He's out of the office. Yeah. All right.
Michael D: Jason, anything urgent that we need to address?
Jason J: No, not… that I'm aware of. I thought you sent.
Phil S: Us a note.
Jason J: Yeah. What was, I remember sending something? Because it was an idea or something?
Phil S: Yeah, co pilot studio integration? Oh,
Jason J: yeah, yeah, yeah, not, like top of mind or anything like this, but I was messing around with the co pilot stuff that they have for us and like just in it's Microsoft, it's Microsoft's regular co pilot studio and stuff. They have a lot of connectors there. I think I put a screenshot in it. Yeah, with all that, yeah, there, there, there are tons. Okay. Tons, Domo does not happen to be one of them.
Michael D: We do have Microsoft add ons. The question, is it part of co pilot, this?
Jason J: Is co pilot specific?
Michael D: Let me route that to Khushboo, who is, over our add ins and integrations and see if she has any idea, matt, I don't know if you're familiar, nope.
Jason J: Yeah. And if you want me to, walk them through what I saw through co pilot and that, and like how that part of it works and stuff. I'm happy to do that.
Michael D: Okay. Yeah. Let me float that by her first, see if she has any,
Jason J: They may be aware, any immediate thoughts. Yeah, like, hey, we should get in here, but like I said, they do have a rest API that you can build yourself. So like if I do get to that point, like without it, I'm sure we can figure out something. But, basically, what we're goofing off or goofing off with really is making a chat bot because it's so stupid, simple in there. But when you do it with copilot studio, you can do some other stuff where it's like you can connect it in with the data and things like that. And I, if I could do that, I could make it so they could ask questions like, hey, what's up with invoice? One, four, five of six and I get all data back for it, which is kind of hard to see an arm in all cases because like we're not at two point yet. So it's one of those things that like, hey, after we do get the chat bot up and running, I'll probably start poking with that to see how I can get data over to get them specific information on it too.
Michael D: And that is the primary use case, more self serve chat bot… to kind of help reduce the amount of advice that you guys are having to feel.
Jason J: Yeah. And I came up with the name of it long ago. It's Json, just ask someone other than me.
Michael D: I like it. I like it. All right. Yeah. Let me shoot that over to Khushboo. I will find out if she's aware of it or if that's on the roadmap for us to get into that storefront?
Phil S: And Jason, more of just a curiosity question… with gemini and with kind of the Google stack, I know home depot is so into it. Is there an equivalent of like a gemini kind of studio or area that is providing chatbots to?
Jason J: I haven't played with it so I can't tell you yet. Okay, I haven't dug as much. I mean, I've used gemini to kind of answer questions and stuff like just the… just kind of their normal like just chat gemini interface past that. I haven't done much with it. Yeah, the co pilot stuff just drug me into it because I was like I resurfaced kind of chatbot idea and I'm actually giving it to somebody else to build most of it so they can go get the credit in that and gonna help with it. Because I mean it's easy. It's stupid simple. But then it's just like I said, those little like, okay, now that we have this built in that, what other kind of little tweaks can we do with it? And that's where I was starting to run into the connectors of like, okay, like I can get it into gbq, we've got that in there already. So, but I don't have a write back. So it's not like I could put the data back in there easily and just get it from there. Yeah. I mean there's different things that I can go to, but I mean, if I can link straight into Domo, that's obviously where I have everything that would give them the answers.
Phil S: Yeah. And what I'm wondering is where is, could we just do that, you know, directly with Domo's AI chat or what's lacking there that I guess is?
Jason J: Easier? Well, and it… we're starting out, this is where the issue is. We're starting out from the fact of a, we have co pilot. Okay. Yes, B, stupid simple. Like I said, and that stupid simple is like, oh, here's, a bunch of documents point to there. And now it starts answering questions for it. That's how you start it off. So that, I mean we've just got to put kind of the documents together… like which ones we want. We've got questions on and that's what people are starting to get together. Now, you basically drop it in onedrive point it to it or point it to multiples and say go. And that's where I'm saying with like the Domo AI chats and… that's not. I mean, I'm not doing it to try and get direct answers off of our data. That would be the add in piece onto Microsoft. Yeah. If I was doing it for just data questions. Yeah. I'd do it in AI in there.

They also talked about the training and onboarding process for the Nabu Sales team, with the goal of having 100% of the team migrated into their sandbox environments and with only viewer access in the production environment by the end of the year. The teams agreed to have weekly meetings on Tuesdays to discuss the project's progress and work on developing the training documentation.","Scott T: and the meeting train continues? Welcome to consulting. Yeah, love it. Hi, John. How you doing good? How are you guys? Good to see you again? Doing well, doing well. Looks like Chris also accepted, which is good because I think we need him, but we'll wait, yeah, I think he's a critical piece of this puzzle. So… yes… there he is. Hey, Chris. How's it going?
Chris G: Muted there doing good? How are you this morning?
Scott T: Yeah, doing well. I was just about to ask if we were morning or afternoon where you are yet. So now, I know just.
Chris G: Got into the afternoon.
Scott T: Oh, OK. That's what I thought, OK?
Chris G: So, yeah.
Scott T: We wanted to talk about all of these sandboxes we want to get set up and walk through… maybe some strategy in terms of how to do that, especially given I know that there's a huge list potentially incoming of finance repositories and hopefully really small repositories that it would make sense to have as linked repositories… pending that list. And I know that we had talked about kind of creating a script for you once we had the list that would create the repositories. So that way we're not having to manually go in and create all of those. I still think that's the right approach for that finance use case. But from my reflection, all of the other, the majority of the other sandboxes were going to be much more simple to perform. So, let me, I had a document somewhere. I have so many different note taking things. I can't remember which one I used for this. Ah, here it is, it was onenote. All right. Hang in. I'll share my screen… desktop one share.
Chris G: Just as a heads up windows update, looks like it's doing something in the background here. If I unexpectedly drop, I'll be right back, but hopefully that does not happen here.
Scott T: I had that a few weeks ago and it was like I… even gave the warning and then when it restarted my computer, it was like please wait like 95 minutes or something for the update to complete. And it was like, oh gosh yeah. So hopefully you don't run into something like that. Can you guys see my screen? I guess, let me confirm that. So I just took this slide off of the presentation we gave you the other day and I wanted to kind of walk through where we were with each instance. And I wanted to confirm that I had the right list because I did see like is which I thought was for information security. But then information security was also on here.
Chris G: Yeah, that's information systems that's us. Ah, okay. Our internal one.
Scott T: I'm just going to put this information system. So I stopped thinking. I've made a typo somewhere. Okay. Perfect. Okay. So where we started was with our nabu sales. We pushed that initial commit that we were getting all the errors through. We got that to go through. And that initial commit was actually set up as a linked repository. I don't think that that's probably the best strategy going forward would be to promote that huge linked repository back and forth. I would probably suggest as content gets developed or modified in that sandbox, that you create a smaller repository from the sandbox and push that into production. But I know we completed the initial commit. Have we added any actual nabu sales users into that instance that are developing content?
Chris G: We do have users added, but I don't think they haven't really been given the go ahead on using that repository yet. And so, I think, you know, kind of part of what I wanted to go through is really, you know, kind of what are the punch list items? You know, if we can just kind of, you know, even here stub out a simple checklist of like, you know, this is the kind of prerequisites we need before we set this up. I, you know, I just shared with you our documentation for the actual promotion process. So we also have documents for, you know, setting up the repositories and such on our end, but I think we're pretty good on that. But this document that I just shared with you is kind of the one we're intending to share with our business partners to explain, you know, how to do the process. So I kind of want to vet that with you as well. But, you know, overall, I think if we could just kind of come up with a punch list of, you know, this is the information we need up front. This is when we should, you know, sit down with the person kind of break, you know, how kind of, you know, give some guardrails of how big should these repositories be? That kind of thing? And then, I think, you know, probably doing a quick training session with the partners just to make sure, you know, they go through the process of updating something at least once, pushing it back to production, us approving it and, you know, getting it loaded in on our end. And then, you know, my expectation is they're going to be doing kind of the train the trainer model. We'll only be working with our main pocs in each of these areas. We'll kind of train them up on the process and then they can proliferate that training to their other folks as needed.
Scott T: Yeah. Absolutely. That makes a lot of sense. So, you said that you shared?
Chris G: By email? I'm sorry, I just emailed it to you.
Scott T: Okay. Yeah. Sometimes my email doesn't sync up automatically, so it's not coming through yet, but that's all right. I'll get… it eventually. I'm sure. Okay. Yeah. So definitely, I want to look at kind of what the documentation you guys have put together is. And then… you mentioned train the trainers. I think we could definitely be involved in helping set up or kind of sit alongside you as you have those train the trainer sessions. I think it'd be great to think about recording those and then kind of editing them and putting them. You can even post that video or link to that video on your instance. So that way as people are coming on board, they have a resource to review… and then going through, yeah, exactly the promotion process as well is nabu sales. Do we think that's kind of where we would want to start with that train the trainer process. Are they a good Guinea pig?

Justin L: Hey, Bellamy, how are you?
Bellamy Y: Good. How are you? Good.
Justin L: Hey, guys.
Bellamy Y: Hey, Justin.
Justin L: How are we doing?
Bellamy Y: Good because eagles won.
Justin L: That was crazy. They barely won. That was a crazy comeback.
Bellamy Y: Barely won that's. Always in the plan.
Justin L: Bellamy, I think I told you my son in law, he grew up in Philly, he's a massive Philadelphia fan. I was just talking to him last night about, I was looking at because I'm a chargers fan looking at the eagles play the chargers in early December in San Diego. So, I think we're going to try and make a road trip and go.
Bellamy Y: Oh, that sounds fun.
Justin L: I won't, be thinking of you that day, just my chargers. Sorry?
Bellamy Y: It's okay. You'll be thinking of us and me the whole time as we win.
Justin L: They're good. They are solid as long as we can keep you to like third down and two or more third down, and one we'll never stop you.
Bellamy Y: So funny because we were, so, me and my boyfriend, we were so mad watching it in the first half and we got so pissed that we both took our jerseys off and we were like, we're not putting jerseys back on until they score a touchdown. And then they start scoring touchdowns and we immediately put it back on and start cheering. It was fun.
Justin L: That's hilarious. I love it.
Bellamy Y: Yeah. And you can hear the crowd booing eagles because that's apparently, the Philly fan base, they just, you just shit on your own team when they suck so much.
Justin L: How far are you from the stadium?
Bellamy Y: We're five minutes away. Oh, wow. Yeah, yeah, it's pretty fun. Nice. Do we know if, oh… hi, Ben. Hey, there. How are you? How are you?
Benjamin P: I'm doing well. I'm doing well, and my team's doing well too. So, oh, yeah, we're both three and eight by the way. Oh, yeah, I'm a Philly fan. So.
Bellamy Y: Oh, wow. Look at you. Well, Ben, how's the, how's everything going with the talent acquisition stuff going?
Benjamin P: Good. I was, I wanted one thing that we didn't really get in touch on last week. The last time I spoke is I was out of the office this Friday before last and right? I believe you had a meeting where?
Justin L: Airport.
Benjamin P: yeah, airport, and I meant to ask you how that meeting went, so.
Bellamy Y: Shane hopped on. Okay, thanks to that. Thanks to you. And… as we listen to care port sides, we realize that we can't establish a real time connection with Domo. I mean, we can, but we shouldn't because then that means we would be running jupiter all day long, and… I don't know if that makes any financial sense for us to run a jupiter notebook for all day long hours a day? And.
Benjamin P: So care for, tell me what type of data that is again?
Bellamy Y: XML, so we'd be ingesting XML. The thing is, though Igor went ahead and signed with mulesoft. So in terms of getting an iPad solution, it seems like we're just going to go with mulesoft from now on when it comes to that sales force field, but the data would still be ingested into Domo to do data analytics here.
Benjamin P: Okay. All right. Sounds good. So, so we're square on that.
Bellamy Y: Yeah, I think so. I think so. Okay.
Benjamin P: And I know Justin was out last week and I don't know if you guys have separate calls to set up to discuss, you know, the contract or if that's if you would like to use this time for that or if you guys want to set up a separate call for that, I just want to make sure that we're using this time in a way, that you find most beneficial Bellamy. And if you find that us having that conversation with Justin during this time is more beneficial to you right now. I just wanted to touch on that for a moment.
Bellamy Y: Yeah, I would like to reserve this touch point for you and I, Ben to talk about the progress on the builds and Justin, if we're going to talk about account related things, maybe we could just have a separate ad hoc, yeah.
Justin L: Yeah, absolutely. I was just, I know that the last time we kind of spoke about it, you were gonna kind of wanted to take some time and review internally like, your usage and kind of what we're talking about maybe come up with an idea of what you're thinking for renewal. So I was kind of waiting on that to put anything together. You know, we do need to get kind of on top of that here in the next week or so. So happy to start. Yeah.
Bellamy Y: Let's set up another call to get in when, forgive me for asking. When does our renewal come on? When do we need to sign the renewal by?
Justin L: October is the end date. So.
Bellamy Y: October. Okay. It's coming up. I mean, what we'll most likely do Justin is probably just to keep our current plan… for now unless something drastically changes in the next couple of weeks, but that's where my intuition is heading at the moment knowing that we're going to continue to build out and would probably need to re scope when the time comes. But I don't think right now based on our usage is at a place where we have to discuss anything sizable in terms of increasing total credit cap. So, I think when we, when it does become sizable, we would probably jump on a early renewal call if possible and kind of square things out that way. What do you think? Yeah.
Justin L: The, the only input I would give you real quick, is on the Domo side kind of keeping your price per credit. Like the easiest way for me to go about that is if you're open to doing like a three year deal, a three year term on the contract, which would make it really easy for me to kind of keep your price per credit. We'll just keep the same amount of credits and… you know, then we can always discuss in six months or whatever. If, if, you know, if your credit usage is going to go up or if we need to add on like the ace, you know, package once we ax Ben from this. Yeah.
Bellamy Y: I would say, I think you're right? I would say we would probably need to because I don't think we're at a point right now where we need to get into like a huge discussion calls around like credit consumption and increases. And I don't think we'd be able to come to anything meaningful in the next couple of w",Consumption Pricing Model,51200.0,Corporate,21HHS.COM,1,Healthcare & Health Services,25,$25M to <$50M,Renewal,Blank,2: Determine Needs,Jeff Ross,2026-10-12,2025-10-04,2025-10-04,,,,,,001Vq000005wsrZIAQ

Sonja D: No.
Dan H: I always just see your SDS.
Sonja D: there you go. Now, you know.
Dan H: Now, I know I've met Calvin in person, but yeah, it's a good photo.
Sonja D: Thank you. It's AI generated.
Dan H: Sincerely?
Sonja D: Yeah, I'm not kidding. Well, I mean, it was a good, it was a good app.
Dan H: It was a picture of you. You just said to make it professional or something.
Sonja D: Yep, 10 pictures of me and then they just put it together. Some of them were really kind of scary. Actually, they're like my teeth were way bigger than my normal smile. It just was, the proportions were off and those were the weird ones that made me cringe. But.
Dan H: Anyway, well, it is hard when like I have 100 pictures of myself at the beach or, you know, but that's not like a professional photo. So, yeah, I'd use those to make a professional one. I think it's smart.
Sonja D: Anyway,
Dan H: that's cool. How goes the testing with your beta users?
Sonja D: You know, I don't know Calvin, have you had a chance to look out there recently? I.
Calvin M: Looked on Friday and one never logged in and the other two were like three weeks ago, it's the latest?
Dan H: Oh, man. Yeah. Well, is that because they're busy or because it sucked or what I think?
Sonja D: They're busy. The two people that logged in initially said, hey, it looks great. I'm traveling the next, whatever, you know, I'll get into it when I can. Yeah. And so she was super busy. And then I haven't reached out to the other ones. I think, you know, part of me is glad I'm glad because I think we're missing some groups in the data set and our internal folks have not done a lot of QA against the other PBMS data reporting. So, having some of the numbers, you know, that's what we were hoping this group would kind of do is dig into that a bit. So, anyway, so that's where we're at right now got it. It's been better otherwise.
Dan H: Okay. Well, did you get your issue you were having with the variables did support get that sorted out for you?
Sonja D: No, let me see where we are with the last… I'll refresh the status to see. I just emailed them this morning. It's not. I mean the dashboard hasn't crashed again. You know, it was just strange the experience that I had it was, I was in the dashboard and then all of a sudden all the controls were gone like not even there, just not even a placeholder when I.
Dan H: Added it that's so weird.
Sonja D: The other time it happened, there was a placeholder for ad control. And this was right before we had a finalist presentation and I had to. So I had to re, add them, reconfigure them. And then I had to promote it to production because I needed to add the logo card so that I could demo out of clearsquare. And luckily, I was able to get that in, you know, in time to demo went off without a hitch. Went great. And then the only hiccup was one of the clients that we had wasn't supposed to be in the dataset. And one of the groups we had weren't supposed to be in the dataset. So we had to try and suppress that. And when Calvin did the PDP, the logo card disappeared. So like suppressing one client, made the logo card not function anymore. So luckily that the, whatever the demo was over after that or, you know, by then, but it was kind of a panic. And so anyway, I did a couple of other things and then I wanted to read and the controls are preventing me from promoting the dashboard to production and that's what they're not. They haven't figured out for me yet. So.
Dan H: Cool. Okay. Well, yeah… if there's anything I can do to, I… can do to help, let me know. Yeah, they're really the ones that we need debugging some of that stuff. But when you come up with a workaround or something, let me know.
Sonja D: Well, I'm guessing it had to do with your, the enhancements to those controls, that kind of created the… yeah.
Dan H: I don't doubt that. It just surprises me that they would let that… cause issues for I… haven't heard about it otherwise, but that doesn't mean that that's not the case. Yeah, let me know if there's anything I can do to help there.
Sonja D: All right. No worries. Sounds good. Were we, did we talk about something last week that we wanted to have you show us how to do a new thing or no?
Dan H: I was actually just coming from one to the other and was just in the process of pulling up my notes. It looks like last week when we talked, you're. going to open a ticket with support to investigate lost permissions. Oh, yeah. You were going to schedule an accounting call with Rebecca. So we were going to talk about her current manual process for invoices.
Sonja D: Yeah.
Dan H: I opted.
Sonja D: To not do that because I was going to take a look at her commissions process on the side. And that time I was going to do that got eaten up by the prep for our finalist presentation on Friday. So I have not yet had a chance to go through her process. And because I wanted to do it there first before I brought her in just to see if I can see sort of what she was doing in advance. So anyway, so that'll still be on the list.
Dan H: Okay. Cool. Yeah, that was really all that I had from… last time.
Sonja D: We're really, I… guess hands in the weeds. I mean, we are, I think I shared with you that, you know, some of our data governance activities around group level tracking, you know, obviously pretty tedious to kind of get that translated so that it all talks to each other from, you know, between Salesforce, our claims data and our finance data, we need to get everything kind of talking to each other and that's just taking a lot of extra time. And then we're seeing some gaps in our files that just, yeah… gaps in our files where we were missing group names, which account teams have to, you know, help us, you know, maintain and manage that. And so we have some work to do there as well. So, I haven't had to, you know, time to think about what I could use help with in Domo right now. So apologize, but that's kind.

Justin L: Yeah. I was up in the mountains here in Utah yesterday afternoon and it's absolutely stunning right now. So.
Abraham M: Yeah. I bet, I mean, you know, we have some mountains, not like you guys for sure. So.
Justin L: Got to get you out here.
Abraham M: Yeah, no, yeah. I got to make it out there one day.
Justin L: Have you been to Utah?
Abraham M: No, no, no. The closest I've been is California and Seattle, but not Utah. Definitely, it's on the list.
Justin L: Cool. Well, if we can figure out what we've got going on, we've got to get you or the team out to Domo palooza that's in the spring that's a really cool event, so.
Abraham M: Yeah, you know… it's become more of an issue recently with just… the overall billing. I mean, and honestly, I think I'll be up front, right? We haven't been managing the service yet… correctly, right? And this is where we find ourselves just asking, you know, why is it that? Now? We're spending so much where just a few years ago, we were probably just spending a little over half of what we spend now. So it's been a significant change and part of it is just trying to understand why.
Justin L: Yeah. Do you feel like you have any understanding of that or?
Abraham M: No, I honestly, because I come from a world where when you buy, so, I'm referencing the azure and Aws infrastructure, right? Is that you do commit for some workloads and you're able to kind of move things around because you have other workflows that you can buy those credits for. And it does lower your overall spend because you're committed for that workload and they're discounted significantly. And when you don't it's per trigger, right? So if it's an event trigger and if it's space on a table that you keep adding columns of data into, then that's when you start to consume, right? Or when you're extracting data out, then your bandwidth rates will go up. So there's from that end, there's a little bit more of understanding for me. With Domo. It just seems to be a different type of I… guess consumption model that I am not familiar with. And I don't think that anyone within the organization can really speak to that except for, you know, we buy these credits, we consume credits because we refresh tables and data. But beyond that, I mean that really is all that we know it seems.
Justin L: Gotcha. Well, obviously, I'm happy to help, you know, in any way I can help you or the team trying to understand better. Like I've only been with this account for a couple of months from all of my research in Abraham. And I do not want to oversimplify this and, you know, make it sound like it's not a big deal. But in my opinion, when that question comes up like, hey, we try and understand why we were spending X amount a couple of years ago or a few years ago. And now we're you know, double that. I think it's a combination of two things. One, when you started on Domo, we were not on this consumption model. It was a license based model, right? Whenever you buy new software, you guys, you know, we always not always, we give discounts typically for new customers, right? And getting them in. So you probably got a really good deal when you came in as we moved through this consumption model or to this consumption model, right? The price is naturally going to go up. Domo, moved to this model because the other model is not good for us, right? It's not good for the customer. It's not good for us. We want to align our costs, you know, that we're paying so that we're profitable so that our customers have a better idea of how they're using Domo and they can track it. I would say the large majority of our customers absolutely love the model because it's so much more predictable, right? And they can, they understand their costs. Now, maybe there's some education that needs to happen for the colmac team to understand. Then the flip side of that is as we moved you guys to this consumption pricing, like you guys are consuming a lot in Domo, like the way that we or you consume credits as we've talked like, if we forgot for just one second legacy credits and standard credits. If you guys just talked about credits you're using, you guys are using and, I don't have it pulled up here, but my, I believe it's close to 300,000 credits per year… right? And you're paying Domo, you… paid Domo 66,000 last year, right? So if you use 300,000 credits and you paid a 66,000, as that works out to be, you're paying something crazy like six or seven cents a credit?
Abraham M: If.
Justin L: my math is anywhere close to correct?
Abraham M: It, but see here's, the thing, right? And this is where… this is, where honestly, it makes absolute, no sense to me, right? Cause you last call, you mentioned we're giving you a lot more credits, right? So, you have these standard cred, I'm forgetting the legacy credits, right? So yeah, we're giving you all these, all these standard credits in hope that you guys grow?
Justin L: No, no, we gave you those. So, so what I,
Abraham M: you know, you right sized us so so we can continue to grow within, the platform, right? And then again, this comes back to us.

Jenna H: I like it. All right. So, yeah, unfortunately, I'm… already booked at that time because I would love to have been able to join you if possible… but that's okay. We're going to get all the information we need, right?
Kevin H: That's the goal… have.
Jenna H: You interacted with these folks before?
Kevin H: Yes, yes. So, each project that we've initiated whether it was the JL dashboard or I'll say the overall nurse call dashboard. We had a different system in place before JL and the false tracker dashboard. We consult with them pretty closely for scoping exactly what their requirements are. So, I believe I showed you the metrics mapping document that we had from the false tracker. A lot of that initial input was received from this same team.
Jenna H: Okay, awesome. That's good. So, they're really good at giving feedback and guidance and things like that, correct?
Kevin H: Sometimes, yes. Okay. Yes.
Jenna H: All right. Well, that is, I mean part of what I'm here to help you with, right? Right. So at the onset of projects, part of the preliminary work is to consult with them… to get kind of like requirements and.
Kevin H: Yeah. So, initially, both of these dashboards came from a little bit earlier stages before we had our processes truly defined. So with these initial assessments, it was more of a hey, what does your current reporting look like? Is there anything that you're missing from this current reporting that you would like to see? And is there any specific format that you prefer to see certain things in? So that was our kind of initial assessment. It has grown a lot since then and we have that process a lot more well defined. That was the, I guess thought process behind our early dashboards and our early, I guess processes.
Jenna H: Okay. And I think… that those are all great questions to start with to surface. And however. A lot of it I guess fluctuates based on who you're talking to.
Kevin H: Right, right. Exactly.
Jenna H: You can get information from one person on leadership and then you go and have a conversation with another one and they're like, oh, I don't care about that. I want this and you're like awesome. So, what I mean, our goal is going to really be to… find some of those key unlocks… during call for you. That is going to really help give you some insight as to why… are these tools not being used more regularly? Right? Like you and the team put in a bunch of effort into building these. They were requested, they could provide massive benefits not only to the company but to like the safety of the people living at your facilities, right? So it could do a lot of really good work, but we need to understand… where the adoption is getting roadblocked. I think.
Kevin H: Right.
Jenna H: So, I know you said like your initial process around like the scoping piece was really revolving around those three questions. What is your new updated process look like?
Kevin H: So I'll say our new updated process is a lot more in depth. Let me see if I can't find our sop really quickly. So initially, like I said, it was those three questions and essentially, we were asking I'll call them the data owners or the business owners of that unit. So one of the biggest kind of upfront changes to that is that now we require not only the leadership level or the data owners, but we also require an executive sponsor to say, hey, this is what is going to drive my department or these are the metrics that are driving my department. And these are operationally what will be valuable to us. So that way we get it from the, I guess mid level leadership and then that executive level as well. So we kind of get two fronts there. We're also asking project success metrics or what would define a successful project to both of those individuals we're defining the audience or who is viewing the data. We're defining the business problem being solved. That way, we can kind of interpret that a little bit more granularly ourselves to say this is the problem they're facing, what are solutions that we can present? And then obviously, we define the source systems and the metrics required. And then we go through a little bit of iteration with that first process. So we ask them to fill out all of those questions in an initial projects request document that will spark us on our internal Domo team to draft a project charter or a statement of work that says, this is what we heard from you. This is what we're going to do to accomplish those initiatives. And then we hav",Consumption Pricing Model,72964.57,Corporate,WCBAY.COM,3,Healthcare & Health Services,415,$50M to <$100M,Upsell,Blank,2: Determine Needs,Eric Smith,2025-12-12,2025-03-24,2025-03-24,,,,,,0015000000uWr4mAAC

They also discussed the filtering functionality and tooltip display for the applications, and agreed to schedule a session next week to walk through the process of publishing a custom app and deploying it to the demo platform.","Benjamin P: good morning. Good morning, Bellamy. Can you hear me?
Bellamy Y: Good morning, Ben. How are you?
Benjamin P: Good.
Bellamy Y: Happy Monday.
Benjamin P: Yes, happy Monday. Did you have a good weekend?
Bellamy Y: Yeah, the weekend was great except for when the eagles lost, that was crazy. How they could fucking loop like that. We're very pissed.
Benjamin P: It was a good game. It was good. I actually, my dad's a broncos fan and I actually, before the game, I actually told him that I picked the broncos to win that game. I expect for some reason, I just had a feeling broncos were going to win that game and they did. They're tough. They are tough. I mean, they're not a pushover by any means the.
Bellamy Y: Way they ran those balls were crazy. They were so fast.
Benjamin P: Yeah. Well, I'm a colts fan and we won 40 to six against the raiders, so.
Bellamy Y: Oh, my God.
Benjamin P: Yeah.
Bellamy Y: Hell. Yeah. Good job.
Benjamin P: Yeah. So plan this week. I'm going to be working on putting that Sankey chart together. I should have that hopefully before our call on Wednesday, I'm working on adding some detail to the tooltips inside of the Kepler maps. I did speak with one of our engineers on Friday and he said the process of publishing a custom app and deploying it to the demo platform should be exactly the same on a windows device than it is on a mac. And so I was wrong in thinking that there were going to be some differences there. It sounds like your experience will probably be very similar if not exactly the same as mine was, which is good because that will help me to sort of walk you through that process using the same steps that I took. So we… should set up some time at some point where I can kind of walk you through what that process looks like. I don't know how soon you want to do that. I know we have some things that we want to get done so that we can deliver this Ta, dashboard. So I don't know if you want to do it after the Ta, dashboard has been delivered or if that's something that you want to do sooner, what do you think?
Bellamy Y: Maybe we can schedule for something next week because I think on the tenth this Friday, we want to deliver that dashboard. So you're right? Maybe we focus on that, and then next week, we'll just do like a quick session where I can just record it too. So we don't have to do it again in the future.
Benjamin P: Okay. All right. One of the things we had talked about was… that there was probably some data from paylocity that we needed to pull in some additional data from paylocity. Is that still correct? And have you built any of the reports that have the data, the additional data that we're going to need to split the Ta dashboard?
Bellamy Y: So I haven't brought it in from paylocity yet, but I did look around with a lot. I actually got sidetracked with a bonus calculation that we have to do in the performance assessment side. So we ended up bringing like two or three other paylocity reports in, but they're not for this one. So I am going to, but luckily, I identified some of those reports. I think the ones that we talked about from paylocity was like terminated reasons and 90 day surveys which would help us to understand the quality of the candidates, how they flow into this. So right now, I think with the data that we do have, we can do the Sankey charts up until the hired point, but we don't have anything after that to say 90 day was good or bad. And then from there on, did it get terminated or not? I think those are the two additional steps that we can add into the Sankey chart… or maybe you think it differently, but I think those two reports, I identified it so I can work on bringing that in together today. I mean.
Benjamin P: All right. Sounds good. Well, okay. So I have what I need to continue building out what we need for the dashboard. And once we have that pay lossy data, we can enhance what we have. So I think we're in a good spot.
Bellamy Y: Yeah. One quick thing we need to do. We… need to make sure from the lever data is if they get hired, they will probably have employee id. I wonder if there's a way for us to identify employee ids in lever? Because that's how we're going to need to that's going to be the unique id that we need to start matching to pay lossity data?
Benjamin P: Yeah. So if somebody gets hired, we need to be able to map them over.
Bellamy Y: Yeah. The employee id, I wonder if there's like a full first name, last name… because then if that's the case, we… can take care of 95 percent of the employees.
Benjamin P: Yeah. I feel like first name and last name is going to be unreliable.
Bellamy Y: Me too.
Benjamin P: Because people can have the same name, you know, maybe you entered my name as Ben Parker in lever. And then Benjamin Parker in pay lossity. And so, you know, it's just, I feel like that's a.
Bellamy Y: Yeah.
Benjamin P: Let me look at the data. Let me see what's in here that we might can use that may be more reliable to lever applications.
Bellamy Y: I'm also like thinking like first name, last name combined with job title or the posting title, which we should cast that to like a couple of code key codes, for example, like physical therapies being just PTS. And then we'll match that into the pay lossity system of PT and their first name, last name. And then also if not, if all else fails, I'm going to look into how we can designate employee ids in lever ourselves as… a custom field.
Benjamin P: So it looks like we do have… so in the opportunities data set, the lever opportunities data set, we do have… email address… and it feels like that would be more reliable than, yeah… name… I mean, most of them have an email address, all of them don't and so maybe if they get far enough along in the process, it requires that I don't know, but… most… of them have email address. Yeah. So, we might, we may can use that if you have their email address. Well, I guess that'll only work. Do you have the email address in paylocity? I think that would be, I might.
Bellamy Y: I think I might have their both email addresses like company and personal. Okay?

How's it going?
Benjamin P: Yeah. Okay. How are you?
Ankit S: Good man. Just another crazy day.
Benjamin P: Indeed, it's been a busy one. I've had a lot of meetings today, yeah… but I felt like sfa and five star went really well this morning, so.
Jack B: Yeah, for sure.
Benjamin P: Hey, Jack.
Jack B: Howdy. Sorry, I'm late.
Benjamin P: It's all right. How are you doing today?
Jack B: Good. How about yourself?
Benjamin P: Good. I'm super happy that we're able to meet again. I know it's been quite some time since I know the team's met with you more recently than I have, but it's been quite some time since you and I have spoken and so I really wanted to spend some time today just re circling back to some of the discussions that we had initially on ways that we could provide some additional value within the demo platform and kind of go through those, see if those are still a priority if they're not identify, try to better understand where you guys are strategically and your business goals so that we can try to align to those. So just a reminder that these are free services that we're providing to math challenge to better align the investment that the company has already made in the demo platform with the value that you're getting. And so every customer isn't part of this initiative, but we identified your account as somebody who could get value from this program. And so we're really hoping that we can get going on something that we can help you with. So does that sound like a good sort of itinerary or is there anything top of mind for you?
Jack B: Yeah. And just to set some context too, like I apologize if I felt like I was blowing y'all off like it's not well, I mean it is intentional but like it's you know, I have like 10 Ish hours a week here. So, you know, sometimes it's challenging like we're doing a big CRM migration now. So like, you know, that chews through that 10 hours pretty quick. So it's not personal. It's just a bandwidth issue. So there's that, and then just in terms of top of mind, I just had some tactical questions about, you know, I'm starting to go through and try and populate some of the data dictionaries like that sort of semantic model piece. And I just, anyway, so I had some tactical questions about that I was hoping to run by y'all but maybe we can start there unless you had something else.
Benjamin P: Yeah, that sounds good. And I think that given that you have limited bandwidth with mass challenge, makes I'm hoping that makes us a little, you know, even more critical to being able to provide value through the Domo platform because we can essentially be an extension of you and help build out where you may not have the bandwidth if you're helping with that migration. So the sooner we can sort of get aligned on what those priorities are, the quicker we can sort of execute as a part of your team. And so, yeah, I actually had the AI readiness in chat as the top thing on the list that we discussed last time. So I felt like that was probably something that was still important to you and that's the first thing that you brought up. So let's go ahead and dive into that and see what questions you have and see where we can go from there.
Jack B: Yeah, that sounds good. Why is zoom being?
Ankit S: Weird. I'm trying to, there we go… share this desktop and move, y'all.
Jack B: so, do you all see Domo?
Benjamin P: We do.
Jack B: Awesome. I think I tried looking through the help and I guess like two things, one is like I'm going through, I started just briefly filling out some of these. So I wanted to make sure like just quick gut check like this feels like the right… that I'm doing the right thing like these feel adequate in terms of the context and then the synonyms. And so appreciating you don't have necessarily like business context, but just in general, like looking at these, you know, the way I understood it is like a sentence or two on what this represents… but yeah, I just wanted to one get your take on that. Does this look like I'm down the right track before I get too far?
Benjamin P: Yes, this does look good. And yeah, there's also some context that you can provide at the dataset level. I don't know if you saw that field or if that's something that you populated, but if you go to edit all at the top, right? Like sort of the middle of the screen, sorry?
Jack B: Oh, gotcha.
Benjamin P: Yep. So if you Qlik on, yeah. So there's a field where you can actually put context about the dataset as a whole, if you find that would be valuable. So you can add some additional context there. So have it at the column level and at the dataset level?
Jack B: Gotcha. Okay. That makes sense. That's good. I'll add that there. And then just sort of like a, I guess at a higher level, I was trying to figure out like a lot of these same attributes, like startup id is like our, we have this mysql database that's the backend of like our, one of our homegrown pieces of software. And so like startup id is like the primary key that uniquely identifies, you know, a company in our ecosystem. And so like, this identifier is in like almost every one of our datasets and I was trying to figure out if there's a better global way other than like copying and pasting this. I did see the copy dictionary, but like, it felt weird like it came over. I'm trying to remember, I think I copied it, tried copying it into another dataset and it was like still just called the startups and mentor dictionary, but it was like, the actual dataset I was applying that to like wasn't startups and mentors, it just had a lot of these same attributes. So like, is there a better way to do that globally?
Benjamin P: Yeah. And I've actually had this question come up a couple of times already recently, what I would recommend because everything in demo including this AI readiness, everything is available through an API endpoint. And so we can actually automate the process of applying these same contextual parameters to the AI readiness on other datasets and so we could create a workflow that simply hits those endpoints.

Justin L: Part of Arizona?
James L: Right here, we're just downtown Phoenix. We're in a building.

James L: Both, we both golf a little bit.
Justin L: I love it. My son is supposed to, he's not sure if it's going to happen, but he's supposed to come down to Chandler Gilbert community college this fall and play on their golf team.
James L: Oh, wow. That would be cool.
Justin L: Yeah, he's trying to figure out what his plan is, but, yeah.

Benjamin P: Yeah, I'll golf this weekend.
Ankit S: And I took it a little too seriously.
James L: Nice. Well, cool. Well, while.
Justin L: We're waiting for Ben. Yeah. So I'm taking over the account. I'll as you work with Ankit and team, our adoption team here on this kind of an initiative. Great. I'll be here in the background and let.
Benjamin P: that.
Justin L: team do their thing with you guys. And then we'll I'll keep going with you as they phase out whenever that happens to be. So.
James L: Could you remind us again? It gets a little bit confusing, not for you guys. I'm sure. But who is in charge of what? Like you're the account person? But then we also have, what is her name? It's, Maddie that she's some sort of person that works with us as well. I don't really what distinguishes, who should I come to you for? Who should I go to Maddie, or what should I go to you for, and what to Maddie? Yeah.
Justin L: Good question. Maddie's your customer success manager. I'm your account executive. Really, you can come to either of Maddie or I for anything just so, you know, we work closely together. Maddie probably handles more stuff in the bucket of like quarterbacking… support tickets and education stuff, and just general, you know, account needs. I, obviously, my main role is to kind of help you guys with your contracts and renewals and your credit usage, and all of that fun stuff. So, but we work closely together and usually it'll be kind of one of us quarterbacking everything just kind of depends on where we're at and what you guys are working on.
James L: So, yeah. So you guys have a nice office there?
Ankit S: That's right. All the, all the thank you texts in different languages, all over the glass… also, to answer the, I guess kind of the other half of that question, Ben and I make up the consulting team and to Justin's point, Justin and Maddie make up the account team. I think it's still pretty valuable to just keep all four of us in the loop with any sort of communications although I'm a project manager, a part of the consulting.
Justin L: Team.
Ankit S: Sometimes I may take on some sort of CSN responsibilities with let's say if I'm assisting with support tickets, sometimes the consulting team members will even submit them, submit those things ourselves. Regardless. I would just say if there's really any needs for any assistant, keep all four of us in the loop just so we're all on the same page and just make sure we all have eyes on everything.

Ankit S: Awesome. What's up, Ben?
Benjamin P: Hello, how's everybody doing today?
James L: Doing great. Thank you.
Benjamin P: Remind me what time zone are you in?
James L: We're currently? Well, we're in Mountain Standard Time, which currently is the same as California time.
Benjamin P: Okay. So you're west coast?
James L: Yeah. Five months a year, we're California or seven months a year. We're California time, five months a year, we're Utah time. Cool. Awesome. Because we never change.
Benjamin P: Oh, well, that's, nice. One less thing to worry about, right?
James L: Right. Absolutely.
Benjamin P: Cool. Okay. Well, yeah, let's jump in. I was really encouraged by the call that we had last week. It was really exciting to see all that you guys are doing in the platform today. So, I know we discussed quite a few things on that call. I would like to sort of go through those again briefly and prioritize what is highest on the list for you guys in terms of implementing a demo and what areas you think you could get the most value, whether it be workflows or AI or whether it's some sort of custom solution… from that. What do you think would be the best direction to begin?
James L: If I had to pick a place to start, I would say some… one area. I think the primary area that would be best would be our call center, like getting them some tools to manage those calls kind of live. We'd get a lot more users using Domo and we'd get more data coming through because we'd be creating data with their follow up with calls. Things like that. Mainly, we have a call center. We have thousands of calls come in a day and we'll have some people that will drop off before getting answered and I want to help them track and make sure that everybody that hangs up gets a call back. So that would be something that I think would hold a lot of value because we're just missing opportunities left and right? But there are quite a few. And so, I mean this can be both of us feedback. If there's something you heard the other day that would be that you feel would be good to start with. That would be great. I know we didn't get into talking about a ton of AI. We could use some AI. I know that there's you guys have some opportunities to do… things like we have reviews that will come in and having AI kind of classify those reviews as positive, negative or keywords, that kin",Consumption Pricing Model,50000.0,Corporate,RISASDENTAL.COM,8,Healthcare & Health Services,74,$10M to <$25M,Upsell,Blank,Closed Won,Justin Labrum,2025-08-12,2025-06-26,2025-08-12,2025-08-12,2025-08-12,2025-08-12,2025-08-12,2025-08-07,0013800001GuYNAAA3

Wayne W: On… all right.
Steve B: There he is.
Michael D: Hello, gentlemen. Hello.
Wayne W: Michael, hello.
William M: Michael.
Michael D: We got the usual suspects here, yes.
Wayne W: We do.
Michael D: Michael.
Steve B: We were just recapping how the call went yesterday with Shane and the adoption team. So, okay. Yep, we're getting things kicked off. There ran some ideas and some possible solutions by Wayne and William. And so, I think we're off to a good start there and they're gonna have some follow up sessions.
William M: Excellent.
Michael D: Excellent. That's great news. Okay. Thanks for that, Steve. All right. Where should we start today? Yeah, great.
Wayne W: Question a lot going on. So, wherever you want to start us off.
Michael D: I would say let's have Todd give our support update if you're available and ready, Todd, I know coming back is always difficult but hopefully everything has been transitioned and you're up to speed. Is there anything critical that we need to provide updates on for Sam? Sarah?
Todd B: Connection? We talked about that yesterday, Wayne, William and myself and I'm looking right now, I'm working with L3 to try to figure out what's going on. So they just sent me a message. So give me a minute. And maybe by the end of the call, I can give you a good update of where it's at, but it's in process, okay?
William M: Thank.
Wayne W: you. Yeah… that's a good win for us. You know, we're always trying to promote, the, you know, the, multiple capabilities of Domo, we're just not dashboards we can, you know, connect these types of systems that we never really thought we could and bring those in so that this one will be a win for us to get the, you know, the buy in from the logistics team. You know, they've been mostly a lean on the bi shop kind of group. And so, I'm really trying to get them over to our side if you will and show them what we can do. So, this will be a good one for us when… we pull it off, yeah.
William M: Right.
Michael D: All right. Well, we'll give him a minute to see if we can find any updates on that. There were a couple things I wanted to touch on as well. I know we had originally talked about connections tour and trying to get you guys there. I wasn't sure if you guys were able to register or not based on those links that we sent. Yeah.
Wayne W: Yeah, I'm signed up. Perfect, William, are you, you're in?
William M: Huh. Yeah. Okay. So.
Wayne W: And, and I even, yeah, and I even added lad, our new employee starts next Monday, you?
Michael D: Were able to add him like to register for him or did you have to create an account? And then, well.
Wayne W: I put his assumed to be work email in there. Okay? So if you see it, and I put it with Dow tile. So I'm… not sure, you know, does it really capture him or not? But I'll put him in.
Michael D: I'll look to see if.
Wayne W: Yeah, you'll see it.
Michael D: Through or not?
Wayne W: Okay. It'll be it'll, be under Ritvik lad, and… that's HRITVIK pronounced Ritvik, just calling lad. It's.
Michael D: easy enough.
Wayne W: Easy enough. Okay.
Michael D: Yeah. Give me a minute to follow up on that one. Just make sure if that did come in. I wasn't sure if there was information that had already been sent and if so, if his email address hasn't been set up, if, does that just kind of go nowhere? Yeah. But, I can check to see how once you registered Wayne and, or William, did you get an email?

They explored options for improving the data input experience, such as adding import/export functionality and leveraging Domo's page filtering capabilities. The conversation also touched on the possibility of using machine learning or ARIMA forecasting to enhance the forecasting process, and they agreed to schedule a follow-up meeting to further discuss the project's direction and implementation.","Keaton M: hey, Scott. Sorry, I was a little late… you're muted?
Scott T: Of course. I am. Okay. I'm doing well. How are you?
Keaton M: I'm doing well as well.
Scott T: Okay. Happy Friday. So, I don't know if you had any luck. So I wanted to kind of start this forecasting thing and see if we can align on how we want the data entered. Did you have any luck on that grid?
Keaton M: Yes. So I got that. Yes, I got my, it to, fix their issues. And so I was able to at least go… back to what I had, so. Start it up. Gonna show you. Yeah. So… do you see that? Yes… so this is kind of my working, what I've worked on so far we're… still the, yeah. So basically just have the SKU retailer, ship point ship method and account manager and then we have four just forecasts across. So… this would be like this. I just, this is like probably the simplest, but this way we could just… have like the copy and paste functionality, undo functionality… and all that kind of stuff in here and have it a little more editable. I know there's ways we can connect this to like a graph as well. I do like some graphing stuff. So, if like you filter to academy, for example, only academy would show up on the graph as well, which would be nice, right? So it like show up in both places. So, yeah, this was kind of the start I had on this. What do you think?
Scott T: Yeah. I mean, so I definitely think being able to see it. I guess the question would be… I mean, what we'd have to explore is like if there's like a, if they Qlik on the row or if you want to add a button to each row or something that would be like graph or something or like, Or if it would just be always whatever, like everything on the table is always making its way into the graph, but yeah.
Keaton M: It's like, yeah, filter or if you could just Qlik on this and a graph it, right?
Scott T: Right. Yeah. I mean, so, so the idea would be we would put this in a separate app and then, or would you like add it to your blackstone. Like the current forecasting app, is that the idea?
Keaton M: Yeah. So I don't know if like. Because this same grid has a graphing… as well. And so I don't know if I'd have to use that for it to that's compatible with the grid, if that makes sense. So, because that's the biggest thing is like making it, so making… it compatible, right?
Scott T: Yeah. So.
Keaton M: That's these are, these aren't they talk. So they're talking to each other, you know? And so that's the biggest thing that I need to dig deeper into.
Scott T: Okay. I.
Keaton M: do know. Sorry to cut you off, but actually, when I was, I didn't know this before, but when working with apps, you can actually. So, I didn't know that… you can actually filter in Domo… I don't use this very often. I use the dashboard look… and it'll actually filter the app as well. Yeah. So.
Scott T: Any page filters, you can use filter cards or the page filter like you did there outside of the app and it filters the data that the app has access to.
Keaton M: Yeah, which is something we could maybe explore if we wanted to separate this and the other one. I don't know what your thoughts on that are. Yeah.
Scott T: I mean, I think that, yes, and I think you can even like have the app talk back to and pass page filters back to the Domo page as well. So like, you can have it.
Keaton M: Oh, you can. Okay. Yeah.
Scott T: Because I've done, I feel like I've done something like that before. I did just want to. So I did do some kind of exploratory alternatives just in case you couldn't get the grid. And so I wanted to see like what your thoughts were on a different system or if you are happy with kind of the way the grid works. So let me, I'm going to share my screen and just show you what… I got working here. So I wanted to play with the idea of I don't know what screen I'm sharing here. I didn't label it. I think this is it. I wanted to play with the idea of different entry methods, right? So in this, in my app version, the first thing you have to do is select a single retailer. I'm assuming that's how they're forecasting, if not, then we can adjust this. But if you pick up a retailer, then it brings up, you know, here's and I just copied some like a bit of data from your instance. So like I just have a few items here, but you can enter these one at a time. You can tab through them like this as you're going or you can hit this export. And so if you export the template, it will, can… I open this? Now, it opens up in excel for you right here, right? So then you can, you know, use all of your excel entries, whatever we'll just say like that, control C and I'm just gonna, I mean you can use formulas or whatever you want, but I don't know, let's see here. If I do this, what will that do? Okay? Whatever. So we get that done. I save it and then I can, so I can do two things here. From that excel file. I can either choose to copy it like this control… C. And then I can just paste it up here and hit parse, and it'll fill in all the data for me. And then I can submit or I can clear this out. Sorry, let's clear it out. And I can choose to now that I've saved it, I can choose to upload the CSV that I just saved and it will again parse all of that out and I can hit confirm. And now it's here and I hit submit forecast. So just like being able to copy and paste and get it added to the forecast for you, right?
Keaton M: Right.
Scott T: And so, obviously, I don't have all the other data. I don't know if that pushing it out into excel and importing it back in would be like a desired option… or not. But this is all just on a JavaScript. So it's not purchasing that grid or anything. I don't know that's just what I built out. I'm happy to go either direction with whatever you want. And obviously, so the idea would be you would have some more item description and then build in whatever historical trends. I'm actually playing with the idea of like being able to like when you first load it in, have it show the last submitted forecast and have that be the starting point going forward. So that way they're not re entering all the same data all the time… but that's yeah.

They also shared personal anecdotes about their experiences with outdoor activities and managing young children, highlighting the similarities in their perspectives and the value they find in these moments. The call concluded with Fui expressing confidence in Domo's ability to provide continued value to Redstone and introducing the new customer success managers who will be joining the monthly sync calls.","Fui K: hey, Shivam. How's it going?
Shivam M: Hi, fui, hi, I'm good. Nice to see you again.
Fui K: How are you? It's mutual. And I know that on the adoption engine motion calls, it's mostly our consulting team running those, right? So my camera's off and I'm more just kind of a fly on the wall.
Shivam M: Still, you are the one who has helped us setting up all these things. You provided us these privileges even though initially those were not in our contract. Still obviously you favored our name so that we can get these things. So, thank you so much for this. And Brian is an amazing Guy, Nick, too.
Fui K: Yeah, Brian and Nick there. So what's interesting, right? Is we have our consulting team, our in house services team… this adoption, they call it adoption engine program, right? Is that it's dedicated ironically for the exact use case, right? An exact situation that redstone found yourselves in, right? With Brian being the, or not like Brian, the other, Brian, right? With?
Shivam M: Brian by park, yeah.
Fui K: With redstone right? When he had left and then just, there was a bit of a shake up, there was a lot of changes and then a lot of questions contractually speaking. But then it turned into like the value. So timing couldn't have been better, right? For it to work out. And honestly, it takes one to know one, right? That type of environment where because you're willing, to work with them, they really enjoy the conversations and directionally speaking just how the team has been open to saying, hey, this is some of the projects that we're working on here, some of the priorities, yes.
Shivam M: Yes, I really liked it. And it's not like that. I, I'm using Domo for the first time. Like it's been six years now. I'm using Domo on a daily basis. But I've never been close to the team that much and, I would give all this credit to you only.
Fui K: No, I appreciate that. It's mutual. I give credit to you and the San Francisco bridge in the background, you know, it's. but, I know, yeah, I know you've been on calls almost every week for the last three weeks, with our consulting team. So today, I wanted to keep it a little bit lighter. I know that Shannon and Colin, most of the time won't be able to join these just from an account management side, wanted to make sure that you have the support needed if there's any questions, right? Regarding the program, regarding any resources, things that we could help. I.
Shivam M: Would say that things are going over the bucket. I have like the support which you are giving me is more than which I ever thought of. So, I would appreciate this now and even I am not on this call. I'll stay, say this thing again to again and to everyone, like if somebody comes to me and they'll ask that, what's the bi software that they should be a part of their team? I would say the Domo is the go for it thing. Your subscription prices are cheaper than the others. As a team, you are always ready to support not just on the mails and you are always available. See that there are multiple calls which I am having since April. So, I would say that this is 11 out of 10 for me.
Fui K: That's amazing. That's awesome. We need to get you here to Utah, to redstone headquarters, you know, and we can meet in person there.
Shivam M: Is some shooting going on? I'll come some.
Fui K: Man. It made it all the way over there. Huh? Yeah. It's global. I still, I, the one of my co workers. She sits right next to me. Her sister was at the event and she comes to the school and she heard the bullet like fly over her.
Shivam M: Yes, I saw the video footage. It was sudden.
Fui K: It is so sad like just there's somewhat of a eerie feeling, you know, right now and it just came back home to my family, right? And hugged my wife and kids a little bit tighter you know, than ever before because it's like, yeah.
Shivam M: I never thought that us or, you know, a quiet place like Utah will have these type of incidents.
Fui K: Right. Yeah, it's one of those even in the office. I want to say a lot of folks are still just kind of, you know, shocked and off putting. One of one of my other colleagues, he was in a QBR with a customer. He was on site, you know, and it was just down the street and he said he's like some people just ended up leaving, you know, in the middle of the, even though it's a big meeting, right? With a lot of executives, a lot of leaders. Some of them just said, hey, I want to go home like I need to be with my family right now, you know?
Shivam M: Obviously, obviously, yeah. And, and, when I saw it that it was not just a, you know, some random person walking on the street, he was somebody who was like, I heard the news that he was alive with Donald trump. So, somebody who is alive with the president and he's been shot dead on the spot, which is really horrific. One of the great days for Utah.
Fui K: Right. Yeah. It's a, it's a very bad reputation, you know, like there's certain things like the olympics are coming to Utah again in, so the olympics were here in and then in so 30 years later, which is just weird to say that's nine years away, eight and a half years away like that's scratching my head.
Shivam M: But I'll definitely come, I've seen pictures of Utah. Like I, we could see galaxy very clearly from Utah. I've seen multiple images, multiple, people. I know they've been there. They have shown me pictures of it. And I, I've said them that now this is one of the must go places for me so that I can not meet the team. I can meet the teams, I can meet food, yeah.
Fui K: You know, it 100 percent. When you come here, there's more positive than negative. I'll put it that way.
Shivam M: And obviously a one, one bad thing cannot cover, you know, all the goods which you guys have, right?
Fui K: Right. Yeah. There's a, there's a ton of, well, and correct me if I'm wrong. Like is there, are there like slopes or skiing or snowboarding?
Shivam M: Resorts, India is all the weathers apart from northern lights. We have almost everything. Okay?

Oliver L: I mean, subway in August is shit enough man.
Brian M: Yeah, no, there was one day where I think we got out just in time, right? Rani. I think we got out just in time because after that, it was complete chaos.
Rani H: Well, we did get out just in time, but I ran an errand that day after to a store and when I was coming out of the store, it was like torrential downpouring like people were like hiding in the subway stations pretty much.

Brian M: Yeah, yep.
Shana B: The new nav is out of beta if you want that.
Oliver L: Yeah.
Shana B: There's I think kind of a small one but highly requested. Do you guys use any date variables?
Brian M: We, yeah, sometimes we do, I tend to have a date rider, but sometimes we do, yeah.
Shana B: Okay. If you do use them, I think pain point there was, you had to set a, a specific date. So, you know, you set your default variable date to, I don't know 20 23 when you first make the thing and that makes sense. And then later on, someone's like, why does this page always default to some random month in 20 23? And so now we've got relative dates for variables. So that's a cool one. I'm trying to think what else there's some betas on AI, functionality within magic ETL. So, the same kind of, formula, you know, text to formula assister that you have in beast mode. We now have that in a couple of tiles in ETL as a beta. Then a lot of things related to cloud warehousing, cool. Yeah.

We're doing data pens for some of our, for our registered universe and the Guy that wrote the scripts somehow didn't think about excluding things that said test one, two three or at test. Com.

Oliver L: It does here. I said you guys just follow them?

And a lot of that is heavily focused around Domo. So, oh, cool. Domo and AI are my two big things that I need to do during break.

Hey, Bobby. Hey, Nick. Hello, everybody. Hey guys. How's everyone doing this week? Good? What about you guys? Doing well? It's already almost Friday. That'll be good. So we're just waiting a couple more, they're doing from our site. So we'll give them a minute, Brian's… here. Awesome. Well, looks like we've got everybody now. So today, I know we wanted to cover some things with Bobby and go through the kind of, what processes you follow and with sales and kind of see maybe where Domo fits in where we can make some of those processes easier… or, you know, take out some manual work. So we went to cover that the first half of the call and then the second half of the call. I believe we were going to go through any updates you all had on boats group, if I remember correctly. So with that, I do want to introduce will from our team as well. So he's new to our team at Domo but he's not new to the platform. He's been on it for a while. So you'll be seeing him likely in all of our calls now going forward. So I'll let will do a quick introduction.
William W: Yeah, that was a great segue, if you could play like some acdc next time. That'd be awesome. But yeah, I came out of turo, the peer to peer car sharing platform. I have a very deep background in sales. So I am excited to kind of hear what you've got going on, Bobby. And I know we've got a lot of good people that have worked with you, but I kind of built the sales program from the ground up at turo through leveraging Domo and Domo insights and just different cool things you can do in there. So I did want to throw that out there. Excited to hear what you guys are going on and any aspirations that you might have on in that department that, you know, maybe we could build stuff in Domo, to drive it forward. But yeah, I'll be, you guys will be seeing more of me and I, you know, I throw this out there to everyone. But if you need anything, just reach out, let me know. Awesome.
Juliana J: And then Bobby, I know this is your time meeting with all first time meeting with all of us as well. So we can kind of go around the horn and do some quick introductions. I know Katie and Rachel are very familiar with us but just so you know, what each one of us does here at Domo. So I'm Juliana, I'm project manager. So I make sure we're all aligned, set up meetings, things like that. I'll pass it over to have John. I don't know if you've met Bobby before. So, okay, I'll let you do an intro as well.
John H: Bobby. Nice to meet you. I'm John Horton, I'm the account executive for your account here at Domo. So I'm really your first line of defense and first point of contact with all things Domo. Great.
Bobby D: Thank you.
Nik K: I can go next, I'm Nick Kumar, I'm a principal technical consultant. So anything related to getting data loaded into Domo ingested, connecting to your systems and then any transformations or logic that needs to apply on top, it can help there. So pass… it to Brian.
Brian F: Hi, I'm Brian Pinterest, I'm a business consultant, principal business consultant here. Demo. I've been here for six years, three years on the client side. My primary role is to help build dashboards, understand your business, and make sure that we're telling the day the data story, make sure you're getting the data you need as quickly as possible. So I'm also going to quickly apologize. I have to eat or I get angry. So I'm going to go off camera for a little bit. Everybody. Everybody's laughing because they've been around me, when I get angry, so I apologize. It's.
Juliana J: it's better. We let Brian eat. Yeah. Awesome. So yeah, we're looking forward to working with you, Bobby, before we start jumping into things. Do you have any questions for us before we start asking you questions? Nope?
Bobby D: I'm good. Thank you.
Juliana J: Okay. All right. Awesome. So I think today, we just kind of we, we've talked about some of the processes you follow with sales and kind of tracking boat sales and stuff with Katie and Rachel, but I think that we wanted to kind of walk through that with you today and then maybe add some more color there, see if there's anything, yeah, that you had in mind. So I think… there was like a process with excel, right? Is that kind of?
Bobby D: Yeah. So I basically, you know, kind of digitized the old school whiteboard like something you would see like a car dealership, where, you know, it's visible on, you have your sales guys and then tells, you know, how many units they sold for the month, what they're working on. So, the way I, you know, so we have a couple variations of that we have on sharepoint, we have kind of like we have an admin sheet where it shows you the deals we have going as a company along with the customer name that, you know, the seller or the buyer's name, and then to, for the broker access, just for the general sales guys, we have their own version where… what just shows, you know, who has, what deal and that stuff, right? So, a lot of the guys here don't use it because, you know, they just focus on you and they focus on themselves and they just power forward. I use it as a, I, you know, I used to be on the other side of the street here and I used to sell boats for hmy also and I used it as a motivation tool, you know, if I would get on there and I would see, you know, whatever anybody has, you know, five deals on the board. It would push me, to do more. So, so the, my excel sheet, which is just so I can there's we have 70 brokers in this company. I oversee, you know, my job is to oversee all of them, but along with Jason, my counterpart in palm beach, but I basically just spearhead the guys that are in my area, which is in this office, Miami beach, and in, in fort lauderdale. So, I just built a basic spreadsheet where it just shows me what deals they have going, the two dates that are important, which, are acceptance of vessel, which is basically when the deal goes hard after they do inspections. And then, you know, once the deal is accepted, I put it in green. So now, I know that deal is 100 percent done. We're just going to close. And then once it closes, I pass it over",Consumption Pricing Model,56526.62,Corporate,HMY.COM,2,Automotive,35,$10M to <$25M,New Logo,Blank,2: Determine Needs,John Hortin,2026-02-27,2024-11-06,2024-11-06,2024-11-06,,,,,0015w00002pDSfGAAW

Benjamin guided Todd through the ETL process in Domo, demonstrating how to clean, transform, and visualize the data to create a sales dashboard with key performance indicators.

","Todd B: hey, Todd.
Phil S: Are you on? Hey, Todd, are you there?
Todd B: Oh, there you are. I got kicked out and I was told I was denied access to join the meeting. I,
Phil S: clicked it. Yeah, it like popped up and I was like approved and then it like, you know, your screen like glitches and it went, I'm like, no.
Todd B: No, I know. I figured I was like, oh, must have been a mistake. How you doing?
Phil S: Doing pretty good. How about yourself?
Todd B: Good. Yeah, getting more and more into the business, getting a little bit, you know, busier now and meeting more. It's more meeting with people than anything at this point that's usually the first step when you start to take over more of the business and whatnot. So getting into that, actually… pulling a lot more data now in general. So this is a good. This is good timing.
Phil S: Yeah.
Todd B: And, I loaded some more stuff in. Is Ben joining today too? Yeah.
Phil S: He is. Yeah, let me.
Todd B: Okay. So, I'm getting, I think I'm getting a better idea of, I like, I uploaded some stuff. I kind of cleaned it up a little bit and well… I mean, very little bit, very little. And then, so now I kind of have an idea what I want to do kind of is tell you guys like bite it off just in little chunks and kind of say like, hey, here's, something that I want to see. Is this the right way? Can we do it? Is this the right way that we go about doing it? And then you guys can tell me, yeah, we can do it and we can make it even better by doing X y and Z, right? Like that's kind of what I'm thinking about.
Phil S: That sounds ideal.
Todd B: Ben, how you doing?
Benjamin P: I am wonderful, Todd. How about yourself?
Todd B: Good, good. Yeah. Just telling Phil I'm getting busier and digging more into data. So it's the right time and I uploaded a couple more data sets as well into Domo for today.
Benjamin P: All right. Let's take a look.
Todd B: So, the first thing that I'm trying to figure out if I can do is create like a heat map like a sales heat map because there's been a lot of talk lately around figuring out okay, which markets are doing well. Like I would say, like the big focus is if, you know, stores in a market on average are running up two percent. We need to find the stores in that market that are down three to five percent to figure out like, okay, what's going on? Like why is everything working in this market but not in these three stores in that same market, right? And so for me thinking about it visually and just kind of looking at it quickly, a heat map was something that I thought we could work on. And so the two data sets I have in there are like PS sales by store month. And then it's supposed to be PS sales, but it's SP, sales by store. Those are the two that I put in there. So one… of the things, let me get this open here. Like looking at the. Okay. So one of the things that I figured out in the pivot tables is to do, I guess it was an old school pivot table where you can drag more things into the rows area. And so it's not like continuously like giving you these dropdowns in excel. So like I have store and I was able to get region name, market name, district, number, district name, state, I even got longitude and latitude in there. I got sales dollars. And from my perspective, it all looks pretty good. I did some of like the editing where I got the like the bad column headers out of there. And so it looks from my perspective, it looks like we have relevant data in there for the most part. So just wanted to get your take on the way that the data came in this time.
Benjamin P: Yeah, this is a, this… is really cool. You know, this latitude… and longitude is always really helpful because we can even do some mapping. If there's an interest there in doing mapping, we can do some maps.
Todd B: Yeah, that's my, that's like, my main goal is to initially just to try to get it in to a map and be able to quickly like, okay, I upload the file, take a look at sales and can quickly go around the map and just look at, you know, at region or market… and it should be bunched in together there. I guess like the latitude and longitude should get me in the right headed in the right direction there anyway for, the market and the district.
Benjamin P: Let's see. I'm going to, I'm going to show you something real quick. Let's see if I can find.
Todd B: And then, so, the other thing that I did real quick is I took the same general format where I have like store name market, all this like latitude longitude. And then I put in all of the sales data by month, broke… it out by month. That was, the other file. And so that one too was the kind of if we can map it out and kind of look at, the heat map, you know, as the year goes along and identify some of those different markets where, you know, items are popping at different times, just like the category in general is popping at different times throughout the year. That's another thing that I was thinking of.
Phil S: Yeah, I'd love to bring in some weather data with that as well, Todd, because I can't imagine that's not highly correlated.
Todd B: Yeah, that's what I was, that's what I was thinking too.
Benjamin P: Where did the bricks go? Bill? Did they just like disappear from the app store?
Phil S: Are you looking for?
Benjamin P: It's.
Phil S: in like the pro code editor,
Todd B: Maybe we don't have it with the demo. Is that, could that be part of?
Benjamin P: It, no, there was no, I can go into pro code editor, but there was bricks here. Like,
Phil S: let's see.
Todd B: If.
Benjamin P: they looks like they did away with which I know bricks were going away in favor of pro code editor, which is fine. I was trying to show how… to do something. Let's see if I go into app store.
Todd B: Stop.
Benjamin P: It's great. Yeah. See if I go into. This is just our CS beta instance. I just searched for brick and you'll see all these different bricks that you can download. I know they show up in this instance for some reason,
Phil S: Yeah, Ben, can we, yeah, can we flag that and ask the just can on that thread that we have on it could be a GCP thing?

David B: Yeah, much better direction. Yeah.

Jessica P: Yeah, I'm like, dang, these are some cool guys like, maybe I'm low key. I think, I'm a closet Detroit fan.

Joseph L: Yeah, I'll take it.
Jessica P: But didn't they have a pretty rough game over the weekend?
Joseph L: Yeah, it was not very fun. We might be bad again.
Jessica P: It was honestly such a bummer because I was like, dang, they were so good last year, they have these fun players. I'm like I'm low key rooting for them then to see them have a rough game.

Joseph L: Well, I won't tell your husband?

Juliana J: I agree. All right. We've got everyone here. I know we've only got about 30 minutes today, so we'll jump into things, Dave. Thanks for sending over those prioritized use cases that is super helpful for us to know kind of where to jump in and what our next steps are. So I went ahead and put them into the overall deck we have going here. So just to verify the finance use case is going to be the top priority. And then, yeah.
David B: I think that one will go well because it ties especially with some of the data move and cleanup we had up above. Like that was one of the larger things we were migrating from our data platform. And I think we've just seen some staffing reductions in that department. So it seems like a nice easy one to knock out first.
Juliana J: Yeah. Okay. Awesome. I agree. So then going over like the quick hits. So these are all items that we wanted to cover on office hours is the order of these because I noticed you had just prioritized like the full use cases? Are these is the order of these? Good? Did you want to change around the order of any of these? Or do you feel like data architecture is the top priority? And then we should just go down the list.
David B: I think those are good. I might have misread the email and thought those were just kind of a set order. But when I went through them, I thought the order made sense anyway. So, okay.
Juliana J: Okay, awesome. That's super helpful. And then the credit usage monitoring. I put this at the bottom here because this is something that we can spin up like it's a dashboard that we can just spin up in your instance and review with you guys. So there's not really too much time we'll need to spend on calls except to review that. So awesome.
David B: I think we're going to be able to like, yeah, I think we already have the dashboard. I found it in the data set. So we got all that set up. Really, this was more of a, I think we know how to monitor our credits, but one, we wanted to confirm how many we had this year and I think we found the contract which was good because I thought we had 7,000, but I think we have 17,000. And then this was more of a flag of like, hey, as we do these other projects before we start, we kind of want to see like how do we estimate how many we're going to use so that we kind of track that against what we have.
Juliana J: Yeah, excellent. OK. So I assume knowing that you have 17,000, you're probably feeling a little bit better about tackling these projects, right? Yeah.
David B: We had, we thought we had 7,000 and we had estimated our data platform move at 5,200. So we were feeling pretty tight.
Juliana J: Oh, wow. OK. Sounds good. Well, I'm glad to know you have some breathing room then with the credits. So, awesome. Cool. And then.
David B: Oh, and sorry, just to bounce back to that AI readiness, I would say we have a little done on that one, right? Joe. It's you know, we've put in some context clues but we kind of just been addressing it on an as needed basis but I think we've done a light lift on like our sales side, maybe not so much the production side thus far, Joe.

Dylan J: Hey, everyone. Nice to meet you. I'm Dylan.
Michael S: Hey, Dylan. How are you?
Dylan J: Good. I'm not replacing anyone. I'm an engagement manager here at Domo. So, mostly just here to learn about you guys and see what you're working on and stuff like that. It sounds like you sync monthly with our team. Is that right?
Michael S: Yes, except Katie recently got married, so, we missed July, maybe June. I'm not sure.
Dylan J: Okay.
Katie O: Yeah.
Dylan J: It's the way it goes.
Michael S: Yeah.
Dylan J: Which is fine. Where are you all located?
Michael S: The northeast New York area?
Dylan J: Okay. What? Like in New York state or which, where are you guys at?
Michael S: Yeah.
Dylan J: Headquarters, New York City? I mean, sorry, New York City?
Michael S: Yeah.
Seth W: Headquarters is New York City.
Chris N: Okay. Where are you?
Dylan J: I'm in Utah. I would love to live on the east coast, but the traffic is insane and I'm glad I don't have to deal with that here. That's.
Seth W: true.
Chris N: It is.
Dylan J: I laugh when I drive to this office, it takes me, it's 32 Miles for me to get here from my house, and it takes me about 32 minutes to get here. And when I flew out to visit harvard who's one of our clients, they, we had to go somewhere and I had to drive two Miles, three Miles, something like that and we put it into the, into Google maps and it said it was going to take us like 40 minutes or something absurd. So, it's one of those things. I'm glad I don't have to deal with?
Chris N: Yeah.
Dylan J: Tell me a little bit about if you guys are okay with it. What do you, what do you have going on right now with Domo? What are you working on?
Chris N: Oh, we work on?
Michael S: All kinds of things. It's like, just, adjusting to the needs of the industry, I guess.
Dylan J: That was very vague Michael, but I'm gonna roll with it.
Michael S: Well, I mean, one thing we do that's a concern right now is, we have client, you know, our data that we give to clients. We use the Domo dashboards for them so they can log into Domo, see how their, digital campaigns are performing. The one thing, is that, we need to make a, and Katie knows about this because we need to make a URL change name because they changed their name. And, oh, hi, Katie. There she is congratulations.
Katie O: Thank you, friend. I'm so sorry that I'm late. My last call ran over. So, I assume that Dylan already did an introduction?
Michael S: Yeah, he talked about there's no traffic in Utah?
Chris N: I.
Katie O: don't know where Dylan comes in from, but every time I've been in Utah in salt lake city, specifically, there was traffic, I will say.
Dylan J: That they do.
Katie O: Have these great on ramps that.
Chris N: we.
Katie O: don't have. However, what is, that you're eating? Is that a bear claw or like an eclair? Because it looked delicious, it's.
Dylan J: a donut. Yeah. Oh.
Chris N: Man.
Seth W: Look at that thing. Listen.
Katie O: They feed them all day long at that office just so, you know, okay, so real quickly, I did want to do a quick little explanation for why Dylan is here. So it's good to see you all. Hi, Seth. Hi, Chris. I don't think I've met Chris before.
Chris N: No, no, because.
Katie O: Michael brought him in today for this.
Michael S: Yeah, I sent you a message because I.
Katie O: saw him this.
Michael S: Morning. He's got a pain point.
Katie O: I love it. So, and then Dylan, what I said to Michael and Melissa was, hey, essentially, you know, for the call, your homework. Is this bring us something that is a pain point for you all right now? And I gave them a couple of examples like maybe you have to do a report for leadership once a month and it's just a real pain in the backside and it would be super helpful if you were able to have some sort of a report built out for you or that, you know, like a dashboard. I think I gave you two more examples of some other items that you could choose. So, and just to kind of be a brainstorming opportunity for them. So, Michael thought he had a few, and then Chris evidently has a pain point that Michael thinks Domo might be able to help him solve. So, the reason Dylan is here is you guys have been selected for a very unique and most importantly free because I know where Seth is going to go. Opportunity with Domo and that is that we would, we have a team and we'd love to build something out that would help make things easier for you. So I'm going to pass it over to Dylan and let him do a more thorough introduction. And then we'll let the whole team introduce themselves if they haven't already.
Chris N: Sure.
Dylan J: Yeah. So essentially, where we're at is we want to be able to add as much value as we can to the things that you're working on already. And so I think, Katie, I mean, the summary that you just gave is a great summary but what we want to be able to do is just to be able to look at the challenges that you're having and to be able to provide from the consulting side some solutions that can help you to solve those problems and make your lives a little bit easier. So, you guys have a lot of different things going on like you were saying, Michael, you know, you said you're in a little bit of everything and I think Katie hit it on the head, hit the nail on the head when she said bring us your pain points. And so what we'll do is we'll have a consulting team behind us. So it'll be me and a couple other consultants who will come in and kind of talk through you with you through those different pain points and be able to properly express, understand your expression of where that pain is coming from and then come up with a solution to solve that problem and to be able to deliver someth",Consumption Pricing Model,0.009999999951105565,NO ASSIGNED AE,COXMEDIA.COM,10,Media,18967,>=$1B,Upsell,Blank,1: Pre-Pipeline,Steve Brown,2025-11-17,2025-08-19,,,,,,,0015000000s1h2vAAA

The group explored the process of connecting to APIs, securely storing credentials, and leveraging Domo's capabilities for data processing and visualization, with a focus on efficiently handling large datasets from the UK's NHS. The conversation highlighted the benefits of using Python in Jupyter Notebooks for data manipulation and cleaning, before integrating the data into Domo's platform.","Johnson K: hey, Joe.
Jonathan T: Hey, Mike. Good morning in a.
Karl A: Couple weeks about. Potentially loading some data into Domo directly from an API using jupyter perhaps or some alternative approach that you might recommend. Is that still what you're after here johnson?
Johnson K: Yeah, definitely. I'm looking for it because we are thinking to kind of process a lot of NHS data in the UK here. So basically, it's spreadsheets, we are finding a solution for having a database here or a data warehouse. So, I'm not sure whether it's going to be databricks or something like that, but definitely would love to see how to connect apis to connect Domo to those through apis even if it be jupyter notebook?
Jonathan T: Yeah, we can, I mean, one of the use cases for jupyter is essentially creating your own connectors, you know, and so that's something that can definitely be done. I don't know if you've done that, Carl, if you have an example of it, I'm going to look for an… example… but, yeah.
Karl A: But, yeah, I mean, I'm interested to see what you have.
Jonathan T: Let me find the instance that it's in and then.
Johnson K: I actually connect to brandwatch to pull the data into jupyter notebook using API library. Does that help or you can show it with your example?
Jonathan T: Say that one more time. I'm sorry, I was looking at this, so.
Johnson K: Basically, I connect to brandwatch, it's a social listening app where it scrapes the data from social media accounts, forums, blogs, etc. So I basically pull all that raw data into jupyter and do all the manipulations, etc. So I do connect to their API directly. So, does that help for your example for the tutorial? Yeah, your example would be good enough.
Jonathan T: If you want, we can take where you're fetching the data, and then we can put it into a data set… that's kind of what you're looking to do, right? Is take data from another place and put it into a Domo data set.
Karl A: Correct. Yeah. Would.
Jonathan T: You want to do it live with your example and just kind of riff on that, how do you want to do that?
Johnson K: Sure. I can share my screen, I guess.
Jonathan T: Up to you.
Johnson K: If it is easy for you to show your example, then that is okay.
Jonathan T: I have to find my example first. I've got to do that. Okay? I might be able to just, no. You've got to find in onedrive this presentation. So in jupyter… didn't do that. See. This is the problem with having too many things that you do is it's hard to find when you need them.
Karl A: Well, John, do you want me to start with the one that I built out?
Jonathan T: Yeah, that'd be great. I can't find this one right now. I'll have to, I'll keep looking for it, but let's see there.
Karl A: I will caution you guys. Obviously, I'm not a developer. What I'm about to show you is probably not best practice or maybe even, you know, what anyone should do it all anyway. But yeah, at least hopefully it'll show you at a high level how you can do this stuff in Domo. So I double checked the editor permissions and you guys do have access to jupyter. Now, jupyter can be a bit tricky to find. So in order to get to it, you first go to the data tab, then you go to the little meatball menu followed by jupyter. And then that will bring you to these jupyter workspaces. Now, I'm just going to start this one up. And whilst it's starting, I'll just talk you through it. So there's a whole bunch of them. When you make them, they'll be listed out here. People who have the right grants can see them. All that's why I can see every single one of these because I just have a high level grant in order to create a new workspace. You Qlik on the new workspace button up here. You give it a name, blah blah blah, whatever. This is probably the most important thing right here. Just to keep costs down, please ensure that you're using a compute tier one as that will be nice and cheap and maybe like put the time out to one hour or something like that, just in case you forget to stop it once you're done. And once you've done that, you can save it and it will start. But there are some extra options here. For example, you can configure input datasets, output datasets. This is probably the most important part is these output datasets as I'm sure you'll want to be getting data out of Domo, sorry, out of jupyter into Domo and let's just have a look at what that looks like here in this one. So I have five output datasets. The name is the name that it will have in Domo. And the alias is what you will reference it as in jupyter, I think that's how it is not 100 percent certain given they're all the same. But yeah, any questions so far? Is it running? Okay, good. No.
Johnson K: Not for you.
Karl A: So, a lot of this was built out just using chatgpt helping me to write it out. It was super helpful especially as I don't know python but yeah, this is some, this is one I prepared earlier. But when you open up your jupyter workspace for the first time, I don't think there'll be much there. There'll be some examples that you can go in and have a look at. These are pretty good for a starting spot. But otherwise, if you want to create a new document or whatever it's called oops, that's not what I was after. How do I? Okay, there, yeah, you just Qlik on the plus sign and then you get your options here. And so you probably just want to make a jupyter notebook to start with. Okay. So yeah, you got to bring in your libraries or whatever they're called pretty straightforward. You know, I think from here, generally speaking, it is quite straightforward in terms of how you can connect to the data and bring out what you want. So, you know, I'm sure you probably know more about this than I do johnson, but I mean, I'm just, you know, I've got my API here, the API key in secret, blah blah blah, getting the token authentication token. I mean, how much detail do you need here, johnson, in order to understand what's going on?
Johnson K: I don't need details. I can go through the code maybe once you share it, but yeah, I just want to understand how it works, the data loading into Domo?

Brian W: Hey, hey, Ankit, can you hear me?
Ankit S: Yes, sir. We got a new angle on you today.
Brian W: Yeah, yeah, we're in Pittsburgh right now. We just finished up our annual finance summit. So we had a really good turnout, probably 40 plus people.
Ankit S: Cool. Nice. Yeah, awesome. Hey, guys. Oh, Aishwarya. How are you?
Aishwarya D: I'm good. How are you?
Ankit S: Good.
Aishwarya D: Awesome.
Brian W: Eric will not be able to join. He's actually in the other room in another meeting. I know he was taking lead the past couple of days because I was kind of sidetracking on their stuff, but it's not like we made really good progress over the past couple of days. It's more validation. I heard there's some validation cards. We're going to break it up by code. Makes it a little bit easier. So, thank you for that. I don't have anything specific if you want to just pull up the dashboard as it stands now.
Aishwarya D: Yeah, I can do that. Sorry, Ankit, did you have anything to say before that?
Ankit S: Nope. I mean, I guess if Fu's not joining, then we can go right ahead.
Brian W: I know he was out of pocket as well. He was actually here but I think he's traveling right now.
Ankit S: Got it. Awesome. Aishwarya. You're all good to go?
Aishwarya D: All right. Let me know once you see the… dashboard.
Brian W: Yes, we can or, yes, I can.
Aishwarya D: Okay. So, I was just testing that's why I've added filters, but just to, when was the last time you checked it? Because we made a couple of changes on Monday and Tuesday, which were changing company name, orion column to just company name.
Brian W: Okay.
Aishwarya D: And after we did that, we noticed some minor changes in the values because I think it was mainly due to the Calvert and modern?
Brian W: Sure.
Aishwarya D: Control. Yeah. Sorry, you don't know why? Okay. It's fine. Yes, but did you get a chance to look at it today? No?
Brian W: Sorry, I have not, I have not, but I can take a look at it in detail immediately after this call later today.
Aishwarya D: Okay. Yeah, because the numbers on top. Everything looks good. It's just when you, sorry, it's on filter, but it's just when you come down here. Oh, by the way, this card is also complete the change in networking capital. Awesome.
Brian W: Yeah, yeah.
Aishwarya D: We were able to get that the way it was in the presentation, we are just not able to hide this particular legend. I mean, there's no need to show both. It's self explanatory, but we're still looking into it, but that's yeah, the main thing was to get it in place and it's done. So.
Brian W: That's that awesome. I'll take a look at it in detail.
Aishwarya D: All right. So let me just remove the filters… and I'll show you what can help you with the validation. I know the first two are pretty self explanatory. I created one for a balance sheet and one for PL details. So if you Qlik the title, it should open in details and then you can, we have already preset filters for you quick filters. So because you know, the calculation we haven't pre, calculated the networking capital because you want to see the breakdown, right? You know, what to do after you see both cost and excess of billing and excess. So it's just subtraction, but then, you know, what to do. So that's why we've just added what is needed. Now, if you want to. Now, this is for, but if you want to change to networking capital, you could come to subgrouping, you can select current assets. Current assets, current liabilities. And then you should have and I've enabled the subtotals but you can disable it if needed. And it shows you the breakdown for a particular company and the current assets and liabilities. Now, I know we have another condition which excludes the cash and cash equivalents, but we thought of still showing it so, you know, how much is, yeah, that makes.
Brian W: sense. And sorry, maybe just to confirm on current liabilities. I think the amounts are probably zero, but we have another filter to exclude the current portion of long term debt.
Aishwarya D: Yeah. So we are excluding that, okay? But not here. We are not excluding anything here. So that comes under.
Brian W: I think it's just like other current liabilities.
Aishwarya D: Yeah, other current liabilities, but no, just give me a second.
Brian W: Oh, there it is.
Aishwarya D: Yeah.
Brian W: OK.
Aishwarya D: So this is account. Sorry, they're in different columns. So just thought of adding both of them. You should see them here somewhere, but again, if you want to filter anything in particular, this will give you the whole picture if you want to go into the details. Okay? So, do you want, like are you clear on this card? Do you want any changes?
Brian W: Yeah, no, I see a date filter. We've got opcos and the taggings by group, the accounts, the roll ups. This should definitely help with the validation.
Aishwarya D: Yeah.
Brian W: So, maybe we could clarify like on the report date. So, I know balance sheet is a little bit different from, you know, like if we pull the report date here for six 30, it's taking the ending balances as of six 30.
Aishwarya D: Yes, that's right?
Brian W: Okay.
Aishwarya D: Oh, no, no, no, it's as of not as of it's just taking for June.
Brian W: Okay. Yeah, it should be the same number, but, yeah, yeah.
Aishwarya D: Yes, yeah. Yeah. And you can filter it here. Again, report date. We did not add company name, but you could also, sorry… because it will be a lot of scroll here, but you can also add them down here. If you just Qlik on company name and then you want, but this should help you look at where the discrepancies are for sure.
Brian W: Okay.
Aishwarya D: And then the second table is also very similar, which will give you the breakdown by PL details, the operating profit, gross, profit revenue, and so on.
Brian W: Great.
Aishwarya D: And the last one, this again, I wanted to do in a table, but the reason we have it in the bridge is because you can have both the bridges side by side because this is where you will see the difference in values after we switch from company name, orion to just company.

BrianWilliam 9: Yeah. Let's talk about what we can.
Aishwarya D: Yeah. All right. I can go ahead and get started. Christine will be joining us after half an hour. Okay. Where are my notes? Did you get a chance to look at the changes made or not yet? I?
BrianWilliam 9: Have not.
Aishwarya D: That's all right. We were very quick. So we got most of it done. Let me share my screen.
BrianWilliam 9: Great. Okay. All right. Still looking at June, got the month to date? Yeah. Go ahead. I was going to say, I know we're still waiting on the budget information. Yeah. Maybe as you're scrolling over to the right here for ttm budget, we don't need that.
Aishwarya D: We don't need.
BrianWilliam 9: Yeah, we don't need the trailing 12 months budget here on the summary table. Okay?
Aishwarya D: Can I remove it? Yeah.
BrianWilliam 9: Yeah.
Aishwarya D: But if anybody joins we can, I see Kyle is here. Yeah. So, yeah. Hey, Kyle, in the meantime, yeah, we can work.
BrianWilliam 9: Yeah. And the reason for that is, I mean, we would potentially combine budgets from last year and this year and it's just not useful or interesting. Yeah. So you can remove it from here.
Aishwarya D: Anything else on this card?
BrianWilliam 9: Ttm? I guess if you remove the ttm numbers, does it get rid of the percentages? Oh, yeah. Yeah. So, thank you for removing the amounts, but the related percentage columns can get removed as well. Ttm versus budget. Yeah, that one… and then the percentage of revenue. Let's see here today? All right.
Aishwarya D: Oh, sorry. I removed the wrong one. Yeah, it takes a bit to load. Sorry about that. So we have, we need percent revenue, but we don't need budget percent revenue, right?
BrianWilliam 9: Yep. Not on ttm.
Aishwarya D: Yeah, I think that should be then. Anything else?
BrianWilliam 9: I'll spot, check the numbers, but I think the table looks good.
Aishwarya D: Okay.
BrianWilliam 9: Thank you.
Aishwarya D: No worries. I had a question. In the second table, I don't remember… we discussed if we still want to remove the operating profit without Astra vertical.
BrianWilliam 9: I see. So we have here. Okay? Vertical… yeah. I know it complicates things a lot to have a vertical, the vertical opex number at the bottom… you know, since this is just consolidated, I think you can remove that line.
Aishwarya D: No, this is consolidated and this is a breakdown by groups?
BrianWilliam 9: Yeah. Sorry, on the group one, you can get rid of that.
Aishwarya D: Okay. And do we need to add the amortization to this card? Because I know we discussed to add them in the next ones?
BrianWilliam 9: No, I don't think it's needed on the summary or the group PL?
Aishwarya D: Yeah. And then if you noticed we collapsed the… groups, they are now by the way, in the right order, it's collapsed. We see the totals instead of the breakdown, but if the end user wants to, they can always Qlik on that breakdown. Okay. So, I would say the first two cards are good then apart from the data validation. Yep. Okay.
BrianWilliam 9: Yeah. And maybe we're not 100 percent on here because I have not had a chance to sync up with Vu, but there are some manual data loads that we'll have to consider here and it might change these cards.
Aishwarya D: Oh, like the cache.
BrianWilliam 9: Sweeps, yeah, cache sweeps is the big one.
Aishwarya D: Strategic initiatives and,
BrianWilliam 9: yeah, that stuff that's something we'll have to handle on the side because we're just doing it in excel on the side. Okay? It doesn't live in the system anywhere?
Aishwarya D: Yeah. Sounds good.
BrianWilliam 9: I'm guessing.
Aishwarya D: We'll remove the ttm budget columns.
BrianWilliam 9: Oh, yes. Yes, please. On this one as well?
Aishwarya D: Yeah. You were saying about the manual uploads?
BrianWilliam 9: Yeah, I got to sync up with Abu on the side. I know he's been at a commercial sales planning meeting this week with Eric. So I think he's actually traveling back home today, so probably not going to be able to catch him, but I know most of our open items here are with us and specifically with boo.
Aishwarya D: Yeah… no worries. I think we still covered a lot yesterday and yeah, see, we are moving forward than halting. So, yeah.
BrianWilliam 9: Let's definitely just knock out what we can.
Aishwarya D: Yeah. And I'm leaning towards not asking the UI UX questions right now until we have Eric… because I know Eric is the one who had some suggestions for the UI UX. So, is that okay if we still keep that towards the end even if the cards are, okay?
BrianWilliam 9: Yeah. Maybe just confirm the UI. What you're talking about is just like how we want to show the visuals here and maybe formatting?
Aishwarya D: Yeah, the formatting. Yeah. Okay. Yeah, formatting the colors, font and everything.

They agreed to work together on the geocoding process to retrieve latitude and longitude coordinates for patient addresses, with the goal of visualizing the data and incorporating additional data points, such as Paylocity employee information, to create a comprehensive dashboard for the organization.","Bellamy Y: Ben.
Benjamin P: Hey, Bellamy.
Bellamy Y: Hey, how are you?
Benjamin P: I'm doing well. How about you?
Bellamy Y: Good. I sent you all the compiled notes so far?
Benjamin P: Yep. Yeah. I just received that and that is going to be, super helpful as we build out the dashboard. So I appreciate you sending that over. That gives us a good place to start. I did want to, I did… want to share something with you that I was able to successfully do today that I think you'll be excited to see… now. While this may look like… I just went to Kepler GL website. What this actually is an application, a react application that has embedded Kepler GL that I could literally deploy to your instance right now if I wanted to. Now, there's no data in here. None of your data is in here. So there would be no value in doing that. But the effort of embedding Kepler into an app has been done successfully as of right now.
Bellamy Y: Oh my God, Ben.
Benjamin P: That was a big step. So now it's getting the data that we need and transforming… this into something useful, great. And then deploying it to your instance. So the question of, is it possible to do this, is the answer is, yes. And since it's an open source tool, there's obviously no cost for using this mapping solution, we just need to have the data to populate the data points with. So I figured you would appreciate seeing that. Oh.
Bellamy Y: Big time, Ben. Thank you so much. Should I prepare the data for you then?
Benjamin P: Yes, we'll probably need to get the geocoder. We'll probably need to do that. So that's something that you want me to work on or if you want to work on that together?
Bellamy Y: Let's work on that together. I want to learn.
Benjamin P: Yeah. Okay. So I believe where we left off on that piece. Is that part of talent acquisition? It is, isn't it?
Bellamy Y: Yes, part of talent acquisition and HR?
Benjamin P: Okay. So you wanted to start on the talent acquisition and this is part of talent acquisition. So sounds like we're aligned. So me working on this isn't deviating from our focus on talent acquisition since it is a contribution to that? Where we left off is that we wanted to use Google API geocoder to… get the latitude… and longitude coordinates for all the addresses that you have, right? What is the data set in your instance right now? That has the addresses that we're trying to geocode?
Bellamy Y: It's called referral… underscore historical data. Let me just double check… it's. Called if you type in historical. There is one. If you scroll all the way down, it's a data flow in Domo that says MD, underscore, referral, underscore, historical data.
Benjamin P: Historical data claim. Yes… right. Let me write this down. When we do. We… circle. It's still a big problem. And what we have here is… it's got 257 columns. So, which column has the address that the patient address?
Bellamy Y: Yes, that one.
Benjamin P: So, the patient address, and that includes the city state and zip code already. And so we'll want to leverage… jupyter workspaces to write a script that imports… these addresses into the API and gets the long?
Bellamy Y: To two latitudes?
Benjamin P: Yeah. So, do you, have, I believe you already created? Didn't you share the… Google API token with me on one of these pages? Yes?
Bellamy Y: Yes, it's in overview dashboards. If you, I've.
Benjamin P: got it. I've got it right here. Okay. Yep. Okay. So, we have the API key. So… we'll see you. All right. So, let's draw something here. I'm going to get out of this. And then there's… this window and I'll find who in notebook. All right. So, I have a jupyter notebook here… and then I'm going to go to the… first silt tree. Oh… and we want to, we're just going to try one address. Just to make sure it works first. So let's… choose. So one of these addresses that we have. Let's try this one… and I'm going to… no… I'm going to call this Agra… put that on my page. So, this is a CSV file. We call it addresses. Okay. Your API token is. here. Let's pop that in there. Let's see if that works. All right. So, it says this is the latitude and longitude for this specific address. So let's see if that's actually correct… Google maps. All right. So here's our long up here. I'm going to copy this. I'm going to replace this… latitude. And then we're going to get the longitude. We're going to replace this and I would expect that it should take us to two two five, two Orlando drive, San Jose California. So, we are in San Jose. I don't see that it put a data point anywhere. So it would be nice if it could have dropped a pinpoint somewhere… but it looks like that actually did work because that is San Jose.
Bellamy Y: Yeah.
Benjamin P: Two, two five, two, Orlando drive, San Jose, California.
Bellamy Y: Amazing.
Benjamin P: It says the latitude, so this is the latitude that Google maps in the browser is getting. 37, three, two five, six. This is 37, three, two five, six. Nice longitude, negative 121 eight, two seven… negative 121. It's slightly different, but it's close enough to be, I mean these houses are all like stacked on top of each other. So just one little movement at this point can change that slightly. But I imagine it's the same exact point.
Bellamy Y: Yeah. I think that we would probably need to get rid of like the last number on both long and lat to be able to combine them together. Well, the reason why I'm saying this is because when I was working with Kepler before, because of the longitude latitude is so long and so specific, what it would do is instead of aggregating like a pocket of regions data together into like a bar, it would actually just give me a whole bunch of one, one, one, one ones in each individual like specific long to latitudes. What I did do before to combat that was to get rid of the last integer of both long and lat, yeah, make it less precise. Yeah, I don't know if that same thing is going to work here or if there's like a different smarter way to approach it.
Benjamin P: We can look at that. I'll have to look at the Kepler… documentation to see if there's some sort of grouping mechanisms that, we c",Consumption Pricing Model,51200.0,Corporate,21HHS.COM,1,Healthcare & Health Services,25,$25M to <$50M,Upsell,Blank,Closed Won,Justin Labrum,2025-08-12,2025-06-26,2025-08-12,2025-08-12,2025-08-12,2025-08-12,2025-08-12,2025-08-07,001Vq000005wsrZIAQ

It's going well, happy Monday. Happy Monday. Happy Monday. Hey, Ashli. Happy Monday.
Ashli M: Hello? Happy Monday.
Juliana J: All right. I think we have everyone all.
Ashli M: Right.
Juliana J: Okay. Cool. Well, today, I know last week, we had talked about looking more into workflows this week, and then Ashli, you had sent over some more questions. So I'm sorry, I'm just pulling up my email really quick. Yeah. All right. Well, so do we want to start with the workflows piece?
Ashli M: Yeah, that sounds good. I think the follow up question I had asked was about accounts and I think Nick sent me what I needed for that.
Juliana J: Yeah. Okay. That's what I was seeing on here too. Okay. Awesome. So then let's start with the workflows piece, Nick. Were you all good to walk us through that? Nick, you might be muted?
Nik K: Sorry about that. Yeah, I'm ready to go now that I'm unmuted. Okay. So I'll provide you a quick walkthrough of the capability. I think you have not seen it, right? Other than just maybe knowing that it exists.
Ashli M: Right. Yeah. Until we really talked last week, trying to understand what it would do. I haven't really explored much. Okay?
Nik K: Yeah. So let's walk through just the theory around it, and then we might have time to do a really quick example. If not, at least we can talk through some things that might be useful and build out pocs in weeks, right? Okay. Workflows is Domo's solution to just business process automation or RPA depending on which vendor you talk to, right? So really what it… does is it gives you this low code drag and drop platform similar to how magic ETL is, right? Get rid of all the programming. And so it lets both tech and business users be able to see processes manage them and put in rules and checks and take actions all in that UI interface. So you can orchestrate, you know, manual activities, things where you're going in and doing checks or sending people emails and coordinating activities kind of offline you can automate a lot of that through this workflow canvas. So automating logic, data integrations, pulling together. So ETL kind of does it, you know, where it's very structured and you have join keys available and filters to define. But if there's any element of custom logic or even if you want to have flexible logic where AI helps you make a determination or you need a human to review something before stitching together a piece of data, right? Or there's two or three values and you need someone to confirm which one it is. You made a forecast and you want to get an approval for, okay, does this look correct before we proceed and save this to our data set as final, right? So it helps automate those kind of processes. Yeah, I think the rest we can get to in a demo. So some of the use cases we've seen with clones are just automating back end processes and governance is kind of a subset of this. But there may be processes in Domo that you can do, right? If you have to do batch renaming, for example. So, one of the things that had come up, you know, where you're doing workflow or workbench was you wanted to rename five or six jobs. Now, that wasn't a huge task. But let's say you were, you know, a couple years into your Domo implementation and now you had 50 data sets to rename. So that's where something like workflows can come in, it can tap into our apis and trigger all of those processes automatically. Things like governance is just monitoring your instance. So again, tapping into the Domo apis to scan, you know, things you want to look for. Are there non compliant naming conventions, right? Are there cards that people are creating or data sets that you might have created and forgotten about? That are just sitting there, taking space so you can monitor for those and then actually take some automated action. So send out emails to, hey, data set owner. You created this six months ago, and it's never been run since, do you still need it, right? You can ask them to delete it or you can even say, okay, this is a reminder. Three days later, we kind of send you another reminder another email. And at that point, if you haven't responded and you can actually go ahead and take the action, right? And use an API to just clean things up. So that's one example of governance, but really anything around user management, if someone leaves your company, right? And in your HR system, you've said, hey, they left. Now, I want to go delete and migrate all their assets in Domo. That's a workflow that can come in and do all of that based on a trigger from someone in HR or your HR system having departed, right? So can talk through a lot of governance examples. Data pipeline orchestration is a little more advanced things. So actually, you know, similar to what you kind of talked about where the triggers in the etls don't always cleanly fire, right? Because you might have data that just had no rows to update. And then there's no event that triggers the dataset or you may have certain conditions, right? Where I want to hypothetically wait for three rows to update, or three orders to come in before I trigger all of my processes and consume credits for etls, for example? So you can actually have? A workflow kind of monitor for those and wait for those custom triggers and put in these additional rules… entirely custom rules, business logic rules or even get to the point of, hey, do I want to run this and ask a user or go refer to an external API? I can go to another internal system and check something and come back and say, okay, now, I want to update the data because it's ready, right? And this could be a pull scenario as well where we don't know if a system is going to export the data, but maybe we want to pull it and check it. And so in IoT, we often have such use cases where we keep checking. And then if something happens then the workflow can say now connector, go run because the data is ready. So, yeah, IoT kind of came up. But a lot of applications in IoT where certain trigger events happen, right? If you're I mean, I don't know how prevalent IoT is in banking or credit unions, but, you know, like s",Consumption Pricing Model,122200.0,Corporate,BEACONCU.ORG,2,Financial Services,193,$25M to <$50M,Renewal,Blank,2: Determine Needs,Kate Kranz,2026-04-30,2023-04-25,2023-04-25,,,,,,0015w00002hvarUAAQ

Phil S: Okay. You got us on the big screen there? Awesome. Yeah, good morning. So, yeah, Mike, we're in person with these guys in kind of later June. So we've met everybody in the room, but for your benefit, we can go through real quick and just say hi from the Domo side. Tell you a little bit about our roles. I'm Phil Stewart enterprise account executive here at Domo, been here a little over three years based in the Austin Texas area. And I've been working with home depot pretty much since I got here at Domo. So home depot has been a customer of Domo's for going on close to three years mostly within the supply chain department, but been working with Bryce over the past two years as well with a project within product engineering. So really excited to go through the details here with you today. I'll let the team introduce themselves, bill. I'll pass it to you first.
William D: Sure. Good morning, everybody, bill Dubois. I had a chance to meet with most of you when I was on site. So I lead our enterprise organization for North America and Canada, working with our largest customers. Obviously home depot, CVS, ups, all verticals, et cetera. Been here coming on 10 years, came out of the procurement space for sap formerly. So if you're angry at something on sap and most people are because the system is pretty jacked up, I decided to go to a self service and productive place and it's a good adventure while I was there, but happy to be here at telmo and looking forward to working with you this morning… boomair?
Umair K: Thanks bill. Hey guys, boomair on the services team at telmo, I've been here just under four years based in Toronto. I work closely with our sales team as well as our customers, just supporting them on kind of understanding their vision and strategy and ultimately turning that into requirements and a statement of work. How do we kind of translate that into features and product capability within telmo? Dan?
Dan R: Dan roden, part of the strategic advisory team here at telmo. I've been with telmo since the beginning. I think I was employee 14 at telmo. So back when we were just scratching it out on whiteboards, so I've seen a lot. I've been really a beneficiary of being part of a lot of great projects working with a lot of great customers. My primary responsibility in this is to ensure that we develop a solution that not only satisfies requirements but exceeds those requirements and make sure that you're getting the most value out of the complete platform in Domo. So, it's been a privilege to work with you so far and excited to talk about what we're going to discuss today.
Phil S: I think that's everybody from the Domo side. And Mike, I was stalking you a little bit on LinkedIn. I noticed that you were at PG before… out of curiosity. So, yeah, PG has been a long time Domo customer as well. I'm just curious if you use the platform during your time there. I know we're in certain verticals and not in others, but curious if you've ever used Domo.
SSC-D8F: I'm not familiar. So, Domo, I don't think was used in the engineering or platform or packaging verticals. I know some systems that are used in that system and I don't think it was Domo, but obviously, I have plenty of beefs with sap. So Phil, we can go offline on that one.
William D: Yeah, that's always a touchy one. Procter gamble has been my customer for 10 years. So I work with David dittman, Scott casale, in the warehousing and transportation. I work with David dittman and his whole team.
Phil S: I know.
SSC-D8F: Dave dittman, yeah, for sure.
William D: So, a great customer and spent a lot of time in the twin towers. So, is.
SSC-D8F: that the vertical you're primarily at with procter gamble?
William D: That's correct? Yes, sir. That's correct?
SSC-D8F: So, rtcis, and those that you're integrating with, like what are you exactly doing in warehousing and transportation because.

Obviously, it's a bit of a challenge for us because it involves me giving someone this high level mission so they can get to the workflows. So that's kind of why it hasn't happened yet. But that will happen next week. We will have… so we're cleaning out some of jess rice's stuff. I'm sure we're going to need to delete some of it. Has anyone ever made workflows for deleting stuff? I know when I was at Domo, that was definitely frowned upon. And so I never did it, but has anyone done that? It would be nice if the code engine functions already existed that we could use?
Michael N: Any idea? Tiva?
Tivakanoa S: What's the function that you're trying to get, Carl?
Karl A: All right. So, jess rice, we need to clear out a bunch of stuff that is unused because, you know, she's no longer here at ipg health. And so we'd like to have a way that we can easily in bulk remove stuff could be cards pages, data, sets, data flows, that sort of thing. Yeah.
Tivakanoa S: So, like I have one customer, they have an automation that happens where if a user goes inactive or something isn't viewed in over 90 days, then like it gets deleted. Is that something that you're talking about kind of like that? Yeah, it's just the there's no, like set one from engineering that you can just import into your instance, but there is a way that you can just use workflows. And it uses like the demo stats. And anytime that the logic is met, that something goes inactive or isn't viewed in a certain amount of time, you just put it up for queue. And then you can have it where it's like a last chance, right? Like, oh, like, are you sure you want to delete this or remove this? It'll give you like a seven day, it'll give you seven days to approve or not approve. After that, it just deletes the user, so that's something that you could use for automation wise, if needed?
Karl A: Yeah. So, the API calls that are used to delete the objects, those are what I'm after. Oh.
Tivakanoa S: Okay. So, like the endpoints that you need. Yep, okay. Let me check the documentation, to see which ones work with workflows, but I'm sure I could even ask my customer what they use, but, yeah, let me get back to you on that one.
Karl A: Great. Appreciate it. And I do have another request for you, Tiva. So, the, the other part of this, of course, is that we don't want to delete everything that, that, jess has. Some of her stuff would like to use the cli to migrate the ownership across to like a service account maybe or me, we haven't figured out what yet. The issue with that is that, i",Consumption Pricing Model,549500.3,Enterprise,IPGHEALTH.COM,4,Media,24,$5M to <$10M,Upsell,Blank,Closed Won,Michael Napoli,2025-08-22,2025-08-20,2025-08-26,2025-08-26,2025-08-26,2025-08-26,2025-08-26,,0015w00002a1T9QAAU

I was able to do the contract amendment, right? Considering the first time I put it through, it was rejected before I even hit send.
Dale W: That's impressive. I must have taken some tips from this. Ae, I've been dealing with all day.
Michael N: I tried to put it in as just a regular quote and it just immediately got rejected.
Dale W: Nice.
Michael N: And it should. And when I thought about it because Kim felt got back to me, she's amazing and I said, do I need to do this as an amendment? She said yes, because it follows their anniversary dates. Then I said, okay.
Dale W: Nice. So, you know, that on the water, yes.
Michael N: We have regional one which is, you know, app development platform. We do a bunch of work for them. Is that big enough? Dale? Ups?
Jace M: Yeah. Well, we, I mean, there's a lot of logos. I think we can use it's. The question is, do we get specific in talking about the use cases that are similar to, you know, what Dale's looking to highlight, right?
William D: Yeah, Dale. Sorry, I'm not. Sorry, chase and Mike for being late but Dale, I'm sorry.
Jace M: It's all right. I'll just order something extra expensive. Next time you're buying. What a,
William D: surprise.
Jace M: That way it goes on your expense report, not mine. Oh, shoot, we started recording, didn't we.
William D: the funniest part is Dale then I'll get back to businesses. We've had some realignments, so there's changes, but all the expense report from the other team continues to come to me and I keep looking at it and I go, boy, you guys are having a great time on my?
Michael N: Budget?
Jace M: Nice.
Dale W: Now, we know where the pro AI chargers are coming from. All right now, it's all full disclosure. Got it. I.
William D: need that. Sorry?
Jace M: Yeah. So, yeah. So, I think there's a couple of things, you know, that you maybe want to look at highlighting. And again, it's you know, we obviously have some pretty big logos that we can throw on there. We can just throw on logos for logo's sake, but also talk about specifically like what are we doing for them? Yeah. And how is that different than just visualization, right?
Dale W: Yeah. I mean, anything, any logo, and I think back to maybe it's specialized which you guys do, which you guys have a front end portal and you're pulling things through, right? And they're turning data into a product that's hosting back out, right? That's anything that allows the product ring to happen or the enterprise pillar across because I think of the Sony kind of the playstation thing of just being able to navigate the complexity of their space and all of that, that's something that no other logo and your competitor logo could handle. So, those types of things are just expansiveness, right?
Jace M: Yeah. Us bank is another big one, right? And they're aries, I don't know if you ever, if you saw that at DP or not what they're doing with aries, it's basically like they have like thousands of people whose only job is to use an app written in Domo that's their job, that's how they interact with their high network individuals.
Dale W: Oh, that was the emmy stuff that she was working on from us bank. Yep. Okay.
Jace M: Yep. Yeah. So I think that's a good one. First of all, it's a nice logo. And second, it talks about the fact that like the use case is really app hosting on Domo, right? So like they're using this as a transactional system and that's a good story there as well. Playstation obviously would be a good one too. Adam probably knows some more. We've got God.
Dale W: Oh,
William D: Riley uses this wall to wall. We're in all groups of Riley, right? We're finance, we're store operations, we're everything.
Jace M: Yeah, we're doing some cool stuff. Oh, I'm not going to call it. I started a group here a minute ago.
William D: What's the goal though? Dale? I just want to hear it from you what you need or what you're looking for.
Dale W: Well, I think this opportunity is really to kind of hit what we've built out for health and the end to end wall to wall, whichever you want to call it. The view of not only just warehousing ETL and viz, but apps and all of that space. Omnicom is trying to piecemeal things together especially in their elements of kind of content supply chain and all of the stuff that they're trying to roll out enterprise wide. And then they're buying tools like a scoping tool that's 700 plus dollars per user per year type of thing. And you're like you guys just take what we have lift and shift it over you're talking about 10 K versus 700 dollars a seat type of thing. Yeah, you know, take some of our stuff for free and then this is what you get.
Jace M: Yeah. So us bank, we also have discount tire, optum, uhg, ally… the universal GSK, there's another one. We could talk about Dale and I don't know if this is of interest to you.
William D: Ally's a good one.
Jace M: We're working, yeah, because it's staffing too, right?
William D: Worldwide staffing too, it's worldwide.
Jace M: Oh, yeah, yeah. Yeah. But I'm saying that that's yeah, because of what, you know, Dale's done some of that too, right? Like how do we staff the engagements? So that would be a good one… there. One of the things we're doing with… playstation right now is we're working on a mobile app with them, right? So like it would be like a full on in the app store app, right? So that, so that playstation would have that and it would look like Domo, you know, like, it would still access and all the content would be in Domo, but it's something that like their people would download from the app store or be controlled via MDM intune, whatever, right? And that would be something that they not only have for themselves but also that would be also for vendors, right? So the vendors would then have this app to interact with data as well. So we can talk maybe about that use case there that we're moving forward with. We're hoping to have something at the next DP kind of highlighting that.
Dale W: Nice that's pretty cool to go all the way to app store with it.

Scott T: Hello? Good afternoon.
Jenna H: How's the Monday going?
Scott T: Pretty much like any other Monday. How about you?
Jenna H: Same here?
Dave A: Trying.
Jenna H: to find the groove for the week?
Scott T: Yeah… it's always fun to see what happened over the weekend and what fires you have to go put out?
Jenna H: Exactly.
Dave A: What happened? Somebody cooking on a blackstone, bring the place down. What's going on?
Scott T: Unfortunately, yeah, no, I wish it.
Jenna H: Talk about the case of the Mondays. Speaking of blackstone. Me and my wife made some pierogies and some kielbasa and peppers on our blackstone last night and they were delicious man.
Dave A: Oh, man. That sounds great. I just did the bacon fried corn. The easy stuff. I was in a rush had too many people over with no plans. So, it was good. Well, we're diving into what wireframes and mock ups and.
Scott T: Yep. I believe. So, I think we're just waiting for Jenna and anonkit. Oh, looks like they are coming here. They are.

Dave A: Don't.
Jenna H: yell, come on.
Dave A: I know I should just let them have free griddles all day, yes.
Jenna H: That sounds like a smart business decision. Yeah.
Dave A: Well, let's do this.
Jenna H: All right. How was your weekend?
Dave A: Rainy. It was just Utah weather, you guys wherever you're at you lucked out.
Jenna H: All right. So, we are going to dive more into discussing the sales app, slash specifically talking about this flash report for Jen?
Dave A: Is that the context is that report?
Jenna H: I mean, that report I think is going to be a big component of it. It sounds like that. That was something that she really wanted to see. Yeah. And so, what I really would like to do is get… a little bit of understanding… on some of those pages the subpages we have in the sales section that we've kind of marked off, looking at those and being like, okay, what… do we really need here? And then referencing the flash report and being like… how, because it's all about your audience, right? And I know Jen loves this report and a lot of executives love a report like this. But is there a way that we can also make it? So it's approachable for other people that would need to be in the sales app to use and have it be a helpful resource. Can it replace some components that are already visualized? Or vice versa? Can we have some visualization support tools? The flash table? Does that sound good?
Dave A: Yeah. Here's, my history with this. I was sitting there. We did go through it once.
Jenna H: Okay.
Dave A: I said, I wrote down a metal note, learn what the heck, this report is. I said, give me a copy of that and I left so that I have seen this once. They do speak in French. Okay? So I do know that CE, is current estimate, but beyond that, I am kind of learning this and I did not look at a lot of the sub pages all right. It is kind of new, but I do know that Jen's passionate about it. Can we convince her off of this? Sure, just, I know she's kind of forced her hand on making it verbatim right now. So I think that would be a good target is to say, hey, look, we recreated this for blackstone and she's got the same report and then we tweak from there. I don't know. Nope. I don't know why she has to have it certain ways.
Jenna H: I mean, probably… it's… you know, what, you know, is what, you know, and it makes it easy to compare and look at the two together. I.
Dave A: Think a good easy thing to do would be to use the sub pages as filters and get them to one page. I think that freedom would be there. Yeah. Okay.
Jenna H: So, let's… I know you said you're still learning that report and that is totally okay. But what I'm wondering is especially in these top and let me pull it up for you so we can all look at it together.
Dave A: There is some other things with this that we did talk about. Okay? And that is their orders are all domestic. So they live and die by that order taken in that day and they're going to try and ship it out in a couple days, maybe a week and that is their sales environment and they are blind to it until it happens for us. 80 percent of our sales happen import and I have those orders through March.
Jenna H: Okay.
Dave A: So to sit here and stare at it and go what came in yesterday? It's like I don't care because they're not going to ship out till April. I can look at that in March, you know? So it is a little bit weird on the blackstone side, but it's like, okay, hey, whatever. We'll just produce the report and go from there.
Jenna H: Okay.
Dave A: So that is one conversation we did have about the nuances and differences.
Jenna H: Okay. And so this is also interesting too. The number of workdays, how many have happened? How many are remaining, what percent of the month is complete? Do you know how they define a workday is a workday? Like a Monday through Friday situation?
Dave A: Yeah, like shipping days. Okay? Like their whole metric is around, how much can we get out this door? Because we get paid for that?
Jenna H: Okay. So, let me. Oops, that's not.
Dave A: I'm going to pull up a calendar and just see if that's what it looks like as well.
Jenna H: Yeah, because I was just trying to figure out.
Scott T: So, how much of the metrics are going to continue to be separate like that, where it's going to be, this is how weber does it because they're primarily domestic and the way they're focused on is like you said volume out the door, and maybe blackstone because you're more forward… looking, you're not as focused on that metric. So, is it, are the metrics going to stay separate or is there a desire to get the whole business on one like KPI structure?
Dave A: There's going to be a desire to go to one KPI structure. So, this is the report they look at rather than say, oh, let's build a separate one that's different for blackstone. No, they want like everything rolled up into one filter option of, oh, turn off blackstone, turn on weber, that kind of thing.

Scott B: That's right. Yeah, Sheila's in the Philippines.
Nick N: Oh, nice.
Scott B: So just to kind of make sure that we're all on the same page, I've been thinking about this morning and how we kind of want to approach it. And I've got a couple of ideas that I want to bounce off the reveal team but to bring Riley up to speed and kind of remind colt what we're talking about here. So we have let me share my screen… got a couple of things up. But the ideal solution that we're going to discuss today. So reveal works with customers they come in, they have the ability to upload files within the reveal app. Sheila and her team will then take those files and they're manually parsing out data from those files. And the end output looks something like this that shows up within the reveal app. And, you know, essentially the there's several tabs here. And what I want to talk about is which one we want to maybe use for this POC today. That's a manual process. And I will show you what a raw file looks like. Riley in case you're curious… looks something like this right here. So look at cook logistics. And Sheila, I picked cook logistics for this one because you gave me an output, a finalized output for cook. So I think that, that'll allow us to take this one. This is what the raw file looks like. All of this data is available in one form or another and there's some nuances that we'll want to talk through. But the goal is to use an agent to parse out what we need based on some prompts that we write and then have that output originally be written to Domo. We'll probably want to pass that through to snowflake someday, right? Nick. But as long as we can get it to Domo, the reveal team has the skill sets to push that wherever they need to. And then eventually back down to the app. The intention of this is to save some… efforts on the reveal side. We've got some highly skilled people that are doing some parsing here that we could potentially automate so that's the idea. And I know I'm being kind of high level because we're going to want to talk through some of this stuff. But as far as what I'm thinking for POC and Nick and Sheila, I'll rely on you guys to kind of give us some guidance here. Let me see where this goes right here. What I'd like to do is let's pick one that I think that wouldn't necessarily be super easy because we want to prove out a concept here. But I also want to do something that would maybe be too overkill for the POC that we're talking about. So I was looking at this earned discount, maybe not that one. What was it? I can't remember which one it was. Maybe you guys have some guidance on one that we'd want to try to tackle at first?
Nick N: I would say at a minimum, the base and earned discounts that's going to encompass. I think most of what our team does.
Scott B: Yeah.
Nick N: The surcharges is really straightforward. Yeah. Okay. So like if we're going to focus on that, I don't think that really proves anything.
Scott B: Okay. That one's not too crazy. So maybe… we start with one of these base or earned discounts. So, okay. So just to kind of help you guys understand this is the goal of the POC is to, and these are all in PDF, right? Yes, they're all in PDF.
Nick N: Format.
Scott B: And then also, let me show you what the current output that's being manually created looks like. Just not sure.
Riley M: And while you pull that up, Scott, are the PDFS that are uploaded all the same format or are they slightly different as far as the order and some of the context that's outlined there?
Shiela A: They're different. There are common formats, but there are some that will be different, okay?
Scott B: And we knew that going into this Riley. So it sounds like the difference between ups and fedex are a little bit larger, but there will be differences even between fedex and fedex, or ups and ups. So we're picking one to start with and one that I've got a raw file for a completed format for.

Jason J: I showed him a bunch of stuff and he said, wow, that's much more advanced and talked about just like a lot of stuff that was just pulling… excel data and being able to formulate. It. So, I mean, that seemed pretty easy.
Phil S: Yeah, it was super neat. So like he's I guess not assigned to a certain category yet, but he's working on like the paint desk. And so, you know, how in a home depot that well, of course, there's like the paint aisle. But then there's like kind of your paint desk is what he was calling it where they have like nine SKUs that are more of like impulse buy kind of spots. And right now there's no data collected on which… SKUs do better. Like, you know, they just have nine SKUs that are always there at the paint desk and they don't total up like how much they collect like by region. Like, hey, in this region, this product is better than that one. And so I was like man that's I guess not too surprising but kind of surprising. And there's no way to do. We had talked about doing like AB testing to where like let's say duct tape, for example, like if I'm sitting there, okay, you're not going to cannibalize the duct tape sales because like it's in other areas like you probably will still walk and go get it. But maybe you won't I don't know. But like if five of those are not cannibalized by not having them there and just leaving them in their regular spot, then you should put impulse buy, you know, kind of stuff there. Yeah, a really neat like analysis. And I mean, like gosh could impact so much, right? Like on like the front end, you're impacting a 1,000,000 dollars a month on use cases on like the back end of affecting returns like imagine like impacting some of that front end revenue too. So it seemed encouraging like at least like an awesome use case, you know?
Jason J: Yep. Well, I mean, I talked to him showed him a bunch of what I did. I mean, like I said I did, I guess it was a lot of what I showed. He was like, wow that's deep end. Like he's… like what, why would you use this over tableau? Like more dashboarding and stuff like that. So I went that direction and was like, hey, this is why I would because I mean tableau's a pain in the ass because it's so old. Now getting it to do some of the simpler things is harder.
Phil S: Yeah… no, thank you for doing it.
Jason J: And the biggest thing with tableau is how you prepare the data to go into it to show because of how our setups are. So you've got to do a bunch of data manipulation before you even send it to tableau. Well, that's a whole lot easier to do in magic ETL. So.
Phil S: Yeah. And his use case would be a lot of like, I mean, it's all in spreadsheets and stuff, but of like manipulating and creating different, yeah, understanding what's correlated to what like all the region, like some of that little, you know, ETL, it's going to be a lot easier in magic ETL than manually dumping things into the spreadsheet. So, fingers crossed, I mean, that would be a huge one. So, I'm hoping we get the more little areas that we get in, I think the easier for everybody, yeah, that we get going. But anything top of mind for you guys, any cases or anything like that?
Jason J: No, I mean, you're pretty much aware of everything?
Phil S: Perfect. And then Jaden, on your side, I know Jason was successful with kind of the service account, you know, getting cloud amp, you know, started set up. Was there anything any news on your side? I know you're pretty much buried in a lot of other work right now.
Jayden C: No. The only thing on our end is that they finally got the sftp eta and it's like two months out. So, I guess we're going to have that now, so.
Jason J: Yeah, it's.
Phil S: like two.
Jason J: Months to set up an sftp?
Jayden C: Yeah. Well, it's someone's side project, so.
Phil S: For, sorry, is that for that's? Getting you connected into some Google bigquery data into that trial instance or?
Jayden C: That's no, that's us being able to get data to them via an import instead of having to do things manually.
Phil S: Oh, okay. From where from home?
Jayden C: Depot.
Phil S: just, oh, from bigquery or from?
Jayden C: Kind of, yeah, majority.
Phil S: Okay. Cool. Well, yeah, I mean, and hopefully the, you know, as more departments get there, I think that it contact Jason that you've got. I mean, hopefully that's somebody that's seeing like, you know, multiple departments using it, maybe that'll be an easier way, yeah, you know, to get connected to that data versus like an sftp and all… through there, any updates on cloud amplifier? Is that already going? Have you already been able to? No?
Jason J: I've they've still got to get me the access to the credentials. Oh, okay. I'm just waiting on that.
Phil S: And then we'll be able to set that up with Zach.
Jason J: But then, I mean, that's just for the read again, we, there's been no discussion past that, on or they haven't talked back to me yet of like what the next steps to try and get the write back would be?
Phil S: Yeah, I think read will probably solve most.
Jason J: Of our issues, it does. I just don't want it to stop there and I don't want them to, I don't want them to really think that it's like I'm okay with it stopping there. So, I'm not.
Phil S: Yes, very good. Very wise. Like let's keep the train rolling.
Jason J: No, no, no, no, we need the whole thing. We need the whole thing. Yeah.
Phil S: Yeah, let's get it all.

Katie F: Hey, good afternoon.
Rachel P: Hi.
Brian F: Afternoon.
Rachel P: Hi… how are you?
Juliana J: How are you guys? Good.
Katie F: Good. Getting ready for another boat show.
Juliana J: How many times a year again? Do you guys have boat shows? I feel like I've asked this a 1,000,000 times.
Katie F: Historically, we've had three large shows in Florida. Occasionally, we do a smaller show or two in Florida this year or our boat show season this year is looking like five major shows… wow two smaller displays, but a larger show level, we're staying busy.
Juliana J: This show that's coming up, is it next week?
Katie F: No, it's about a month out, but a lot of materials have to be submitted beforehand. It's a Newport boat show in Rhode Island.
Juliana J: Okay. Nice. Are you guys traveling up to Rhode Island for it then?
Katie F: We'll see Rachel and I are kind of in the south a little bit.
Umair K: So, I was actually in Rhode Island last week for the first time ever because that's where CVS headquarters is, and I got to say I would have never gone otherwise, but providence was pretty nice.
Katie F: Yeah, they have a,
Umair K: nice little food scene and, you know, some walkable areas. It was pretty solid.
Katie F: Yeah.
Umair K: I don't think I'd move there.
Brian F: But it.
Umair K: was nice to visit.
Juliana J: Rhode Island is, very tiny and very, I don't know. I like to go to Boston when I'm up there, there's more to do there.
Rachel P: Yeah, it definitely depends on where you go, like we went to block island, which is like a little, I think it's a ferry ride from the Newport providence area. And that is such a cute island. They have hydrangeas everywhere. The little shiplap shops with the American flags flying. It's just very, what you picture new england to be. Yeah, but a lot of places in that area like on the mainland that don't look like that at all? What?
Juliana J: Did you say, what did you say it was called? Again?
Rachel P: Block island?
Juliana J: Block island? Okay. My brother lives in providence, so I'm going to have to go there. The next time I'm up there, that's a good note. I always tell him there's nothing to do where he lives. So, I'm coming up with that. Well, if you.
Rachel P: Go there, I think it's like maybe an hour ferry and then just rent like a vespa and it's kind of the island goes up, right? So you ride up and then you see cliffs and things like that. So it's actually very cute.
Juliana J: That's cool.
Umair K: I should have asked you for some recommendations, Juliana. We ended up doing all right.
Katie F: What is the name of the restaurant on the hill, Rachel on block island?
Rachel P: Oh, goodness. That place?
Katie F: Was beautiful. It's a pretty view too.
Rachel P: I'd have to go back through my photos. I'm sure it's I wrote it down there that's.
Katie F: really?
Rachel P: Nice.
Katie F: But definitely worth stopping Juliana. Okay. We'll try to remember the name. I just.
Rachel P: I.
Juliana J: just googled restaurant on the hill on block island or block island, and there's a few, so.
Katie F: This is.
Juliana J: Awesome. Okay. Well, I think we have everyone here from our end. So today, I guess last time we met, we kind of started touching on quite a few different items, some short term items, some more long term items that we've added into a roadmap that we started building out for you guys. And I believe we just wanted to get more in depth with some of, the more short term goals with marketing and kind of what you want to do there, what you want to see and just how we can help there. I know you guys already have that dashboard and it sounds like maybe there's some issues with getting things to update on there that's stopping you from using that. And then, we can talk more about just next steps with marketing.
Katie F: As far as the current dashboard, I think really the biggest roadblock is the fact that we connect all of our data off the boat id numbers which come from boats group. And that is a manual upload. And between everything that Rachel and I both do on a daily and weekly basis, it's so hard to go back and up like export that file from boats group and then upload it. And I know it's a simple like menial task in the grand scheme of things, but it's just, it's not ideal. So I actually have a call with boats group. I don't have a set time yet. I'm waiting for them to confirm back and it's actually specifically on their reporting and how they could improve what they currently have. So my pure ask on that conversation is going to be some type of API feed with reporting or something where we can take that data and transform it because that's what we build everything off of in Domo… other than that, it's really coming down to Rachel and I building out the different tiles that we need, which… Rachel remind me if I'm wrong. But I think we might need to schedule another call with the two representatives we worked with maybe a month ago. And I know Maddie was kind of running point on that. I don't to be honest, I don't know what happened or where that fell off. But there was something as far as impressions where it was only pulling like a few data sources or maybe impressions were called other things in different connections where we need to kind of re, look at that. So it's actually useful instead of like half the data other than that, I don't really have any feedback on the current board.
Juliana J: Okay. Was the impressions? Was that something we had worked on with momta with like the GA for data and maybe… Hubspot?
Katie F: It had the Google analytics and it had a few other data sources but we noticed it was missing some. Let me just pull it up really quick. So, it was impressions by platform and, it shows a handful of our connections but I think, it was missing a couple like it wasn't reporting on some of them. So just figuring out how we can either adjust that or rework it. So it is more useful. Yeah Hubspot wasn't reporting. YouTube wasn't reporting and Google analytics wasn't reporting. Or the only thing was Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, Google… ads and boats group.

Juliana J: All right, really quick. Thanks for adding us to your instance this morning and getting those datasets sent over… Nick really quick. Were you able to get into the instance this morning?
Nik K: Yes, I was, yeah… I'll spend some time looking at the links you shared. So, thank you.
Juliana J: Okay, awesome. Then Nick, do you want to just jump right into those? Is there anything else you guys want to cover today on this call besides going over those data architecture, items?
Dave: I think that should cover the basis of it. We did just give the team update on where we're at with prioritization. Everybody was pretty happy with that. Then we've got the finance meeting this afternoon. So I think running through those is good then just Joe on our end, seeing if there's anything else we wanted to give, but I think you kind of gave what the four larger retail ones?
Joseph L: Yeah, yeah, I figured that'd be a good place to start.
Dave: The only thing I was thinking after I looked at it is if we maybe want to share the wholesale data sets as well since they have a lot of similar like categories and things. So if there's going to be any cleanup across them, it would probably apply to those two. Then we'll see where we go from there, but it might, you know, from there further touch on the finished goods, but I think just having all the sales in one might be a good place to start.
Nik K: So, we can start with the retail side, and then we can look at wholesale as well. So, I think here, let me share my screen. So I tried just based on the ones you had shared, right? Just mapping out what's happening and what the current architecture looks like. And I think you called this out in the email that you sent as well as you shared these that there are multiple variants of the sales data, right? So you've got it loaded by SKU by demographic, and then there's online and retail coming separately at the raw layer, right? So if you think of this as just the raw SQL server data sets, then there's a transformed layer. So discount and demographic kind of just pull these and are done, the SKU sales is a longer pipeline. But like you said, it should be possible just to merge all of these, right? These are essentially dimensions or one more attribute on top of the sales. Unless there's something fundamentally different from the raw layer.
Joseph L: No, that's about, right? It's all pulled basically from the same tables, but it's set up under the old contract structure basically of trying to keep row counts down where, you know, ideally, I would like to be able to find some way to get to like ticket level detail in here. And we could basically create every… thing we need for retail and wholesale off of that one data set. But the question comes to like how many credits is it using? If we pull on, you know, a ton of lines going to that level of data et cetera. But yeah, basically, right now, it's they're separate just because of that, you know, one is going to a dashboard for discounts. One's going for the demographics. One's just going for item level sales. I.
Dave: Think with the old structure, we definitely designed data sets to meet the dashboard in mind versus the opposite way around because we were working within those lines. So, yeah.
Nik K: Yeah. Okay. That makes sense. Oops. So with credit based consumption, right? You have… outputs are of each ETL are charged. So if you have, whether you have, you know, one ETL piping out all three of these in some cases like especially just this part here, right? You do sales by channel. And then there's a separate ETL which unpivots it, right? Whether these are two separate etls or one ETL, and this is just a sub output of that, right? It's the same number of credits. What you're charged for is the number of data sets that are updated with the run. So in that case… what we especially want to do is, right, these three that are overlapping. And then the same thing here, if there's three or four of these that's just extra credits, it's not very efficient, right? From a credit consumption perspective. And then just, I mean everything else that comes with having multiple pipelines means if there's a rule change here or if a territory name is changed right now, you have three places to go and update that, right? It's so that… essentially would be where we kind of start. I'd say is, you know, let's merge from the raw layer. Let's see if you can get all the sales in and if these dimensions can come in. So you have ticket level, but then skew comes in and then you have your product dimension come in, right? So everything maps out of that one core raw data set. And the way you're charged executions is up to a 25,000,000 row limit. Now, I didn't look at all of them. I think I looked at a few of these and you were well well below that kind of volume unless, you know, maybe some of the bigger ones here could be in the millions. But… if you think about the way that's updating even if that volume grows a lot, right? The other thing we should look at setting up is just subset processing from the perspective of reducing load on your SQL server. But just do you really need to pipe up all transactions all the time? At least the ones I looked at were set to folder place, right? Rather than an upsert or partitioned update. Is that accurate? Like, I admit, I didn't look at every single one of the data sets, maybe some of them are set up, but.

Ravi K: Meet is another meeting. Yeah. Okay. Before he joins, let me share my screen. I want to explain and what I'm looking for is from this meeting. Yeah. Are you able to see me? Let me know when you're able to see my screen. Yeah, sure. Okay. Yes. Okay. So, this is my invoice for 20 25. I know I joined this team little later on. Yeah, July time frame. So, previously, Roger is handling and this is my invoice for 20 25 with 75,000 credits and four point 5,000,000 card loads. Okay? Yep. And now, if I move to my next screen, I think this is the invoice submitted the proposal for 20 26.
Kevin W: The proposal for the three year? Yeah, it's combined.
Ravi K: Combined exactly. Yeah, this is combined with the gff and symphony and 315 credits and 18, close to 19,000,000 card loads. So, and this proposal is, I think 14 point four increase for year over year, and it is for 26, 27 and 28, right? Yeah. Question is… if I go back to my 20 25, what is my consumption? Okay? About credits? Because, you know, right? Fgv, there is a application which will fgv and we are migrating all the fgv users to symphony, but fgv has their own reporting tool called Cognos. Maybe fgv users may consume some of the dashboards. So, my director, I mean, senior director, Vadim's question is, so we are adding more users. Is there any growth first? He want to know how many credits we have consumed this year by symphony. And if the users added, is there any impact to our purchase?
Kevin W: Yeah, users don't users are free.
Ravi K: Yeah, users are free. No, no, I'm just saying.
Kevin W: Yeah. So adding users only, if those users are creating more content would add more credits?
Ravi K: Yeah, exactly. They won't create only the, they will consume.
Kevin W: Yeah. So if they're just view only, you're not going to add any more credits unless again, they're bringing additional if it's users that have new use cases that you guys are then going to need to create more content for then, yes, you'll use some more credits.
Ravi K: Yeah, definitely. They won't create any content. Only, we will create the dashboards and embedded in symfony.
Kevin W: Yeah. Okay.
Ravi K: Okay. So with that said, I want to just, we created one dashboard today. Still, it is not up to date and we have tagged all, our objects as in symfony. So maybe that's why I want to show it to Braxton. That is the right approach and we are in the right path with that said Rama. Do you want to share your screen and show?
Rama K: Sure. Hi, Kevin in, let me know once you're able to see my screen… yep we can see it. So this is a dashboard which we have created yesterday, nice.
Braxton F: Looking dashboard by the way.
Kevin W: I love this. This looks great. That's very nice.
Ravi K: Yeah, actually, Rama is very good you.
Kevin W: Guys are getting good at this.
Ravi K: Yeah, Rama is very good in creating the dashboards. And very quickly he came up with this design and, I think maybe.
Braxton F: We'll hire you and you can come make them.
Ravi K: No, no, no, no, yeah. Yeah. Don't do that. No… I'm hiding his location. I love it. Only kidding. Okay.
Rama K: So the main reason what we need here. So as we know that inside we have the two instance, one is the uat and production, right? For each of these instance, we want to know each team members, how much they're replacing the credits? Okay. The only way we can differentiate as of today is that using the tax, right? Is there any other way before that?
Braxton F: No tags is the right way?
Rama K: Okay. So, okay. Then we can build on this one. We can able to differentiate the team members, correct?
Ravi K: Yes.
Rama K: Okay. So the next question here, let's say an example for the datasets and data flows that's absolutely fine because there is a liberty we can go and add our tags and, all right, so that can differentiate the datasets and data flows. So, what about the cards and dashboards and the tokens? How can we, for example, let's take an example for here for the July month, right? If we see for a particular day on second of July, it consumed almost the uat one, 6,000 credits, right? Okay. If I go back, go into the details, if you see the 5,800 credits was used for the tokens itself?
Braxton F: Yes.
Rama K: Now, how I can come to know this token was utilized by which team?
Braxton F: Yeah, that I don't believe we can break down any further than a daily basis. So, and the good news is going in the past, right? We're only showing you this information. LLM token usage actually starts October first related to, you know, AI services. So, but we're showing you this information, but I believe this information is aggregated at an instance level per day. So I don't believe that we can differentiate which like process consumed those credits.
Ravi K: Okay. Because maybe, yes, I think we had a AI meeting, right? I think in June Braxton, I think you guys came and explained for all the teams, maybe they done some POC, yeah, gff teams done them some POC, that's why that spike was on that day.
Braxton F: Yeah. And it's very likely with a spike that large that it wasn't someone just asking questions in AI chat because that's typically very small amount of token usage that appears that someone might have run like an ETL or a workflow that had an AI component and they were looping over, you know, in a dataset and performing some AI type of analysis. So that's what that appears but I don't believe we're going to be able to differentiate like, symphony team versus like gff symphony team on that specific skew.
Ravi K: Okay. So, in that case, Rama, can you select all the tags related to symphony?

Richard expressed interest in leveraging Domo's data platform and AI capabilities to address challenges such as accessing data from disparate sources, building dashboards, and automating data-driven tasks for his team of 100 people. Phil offered to connect Richard with Domo's product engineering team to explore specific use cases and demonstrate the platform's capabilities, highlighting the potential value Domo could provide to Home Depot.","Phil S: hey, good afternoon, rich. How are you, Phil? How's your day going so far?
Richard A: Been good. It's been a busy one but it's been good awesome.
Phil S: Well, thank you for blocking out some time to learn a little bit more about Delmo today.
Richard A: Yeah. And I apologize just for being curt, but… I don't have a ton of time and I'm sure, as you can imagine, we get a 1,000,000 contacts for stuff because you're a home depot vendor. I do want to just understand, just jump in pretty quickly on understanding just where you work today, like… within home depot, you know, and kind of how long, and just general footprint and then understand sort of the types of things that you all can do, you know, happy to share a little bit more about my team as well. But I would love to start by just understanding Delmo and kind of the, you know, where the opportunities might lie.
Phil S: Yeah, right. To the point, I like it. No problem. Yeah, we've been working with home depot for about three years. One cool little thing I'll flash on the screen. We recently Jason jongley, he's a, you know, senior operations analyst inside of supply chain. So supply chain has been the primary user of Delmo. They're the first ones that purchased Delmo about three years ago. And to give you just a very quick version of, you know, the use case, this one kind of amplifies it is that within home depot, you know, better than I do the reverse logistics centers that, you know, are processing, you know, so much of that inventory and a lot of what that team does is also, you know, resells that into like the salvage different vendors and providers as well. One of the logistical, you know, data problems. There was understanding, okay, what can we sell all these products for? And how do we even know, you know, what the actual market rate is for those products as well as like what's the cost of goods sold for the products that end up due going to, you know, recycle or waste, right? And we were able to, you know, Jason was able to do that through the Domo platform because we integrate, we've got a service account established with Google bigquery. So any data, you know, you guys are one of the largest Google customers and we're not doing anything to, you know, replace bigquery. We just integrate directly with it. So think of Domo as the ability to integrate with all the data that's in bigquery but then there's a lot of data like in Jason's example from hundreds of different, you know, salvage partners that have, you know, spreadsheets, all kinds of other data as well as just the data collected from the field of, okay, what is the actual inventory here? And being able to do some ETL work? So data transformation work inside of a interface within Domo to produce, you know, that actual insights, you know, as well. So really it's like for other, you know, home depot departments like yours, you might have a lot of data that you want in bigquery but then you've got hundreds of people sending out quotes and maybe there's other data that you would like to visualize in a different way or other data that you'd like to add into the context there. So that was supply chain has been our initial use case. The other one is product engineering. So we've been working with product engineering about a year and a half. I was just in Atlanta last week at the HQ, they're looking at doing a phase two project with us product engineering. For all the, you know, 33 percent of home depot SKUs are the private label brands where home depot is responsible for, you know, sending it out to all the different service providers, all the testing on, you know, understanding, you know, quality of the products, but also do they comply with different regulations as well? All that data was just in a bunch of PDF documents, believe it or not. And there's you know, a team of 40 to 50 engineers that were having to go through really just a lot of email correspondence. And if you're looking up what tests happened three years ago or this, that was really just people having to go through PDF documents. So Domo was able to digitize all of that. So just through scraping all those PDFS, materialize that in Domo and then report against the data that they've got in Google bigquery as well. So they can have like good reporting on, you know, different trends within tests. And if they have just questions about, you know, how did this product test last year? They can quickly just, you know, query that inside of Domo as well. So the two biggest use cases there's a lot of others that are kind of in more exploratory phase, I would say, but those are the primary ones. Any initial questions there?
Richard A: Yeah. So is Domo then a UI? So a user logs in and then whether it sounds like uploading just a bunch of random PDFS or do I, you know, do you tell it where in bigquery to look? And then you're able to just like nlp of you just asking it questions or like how does it, what is it that, you know? Or are you guys like a service like you come in and you do that work yourselves right? Knowing the problem space, like how is the model, the interaction model work? Like? Yeah.
Phil S: Yeah. Absolutely. So Domo is an entire data platform. Think of us as like sitting on top of your data stack. So, I know home depot, you know, tableau is really popular as well as Power BI. So yes, we can produce all of the visuals. But in Jason's case, instead of in the home depot stack, you might have to use a different tool for your ETL, right? Like alteryx is a tool used in home depot, airflows is another tool or SQL or you might have to just get a developer. And then you would also, you know, need another tool to, you know, just connect like into bigquery right? Which is really hard to get permission to those accounts. So, Domo is a one stop shop instead of having to go to those five different places for home depot. So yes, we're a full data platform. We've already, it took us about, I don't know it may be even longer than a year, but we went through all the security third party audits to get a service account, you know, into bigquery as well.

Kris C: Hola.
Nik K: What's happening folks?
Robert A: Hey, everybody.
Nik K: People actually come into a meeting on time?
Robert A: Really? You.
Nik K: hello? So, Julie, I was going to be a couple minutes late. So, are we good from the pharmacann side?
Robert A: I think we're waiting on two more people. Okay? Two three.
Claire D: Is it Mike and Noah that we're waiting on?
Robert A: Blevins is one, I was thinking blevins and Mike.
Dave: Oh, I'm here.
Claire D: Yeah, I think it's oh, never mind. I'll ping Mike and Noah really fast.
Robert A: Should've went with blevins instead of Dave, you know?
Dave: Right. Being able to keep using my first name?
Robert A: It took me a while to adjust to people using your first name because Dave, who's Dave?
Claire D: Yeah. So, Mike just joined and Noah's coming in shortly. So, I think we're probably good to kick off from the pharmacann side.
Nik K: Okay. Awesome. Since there's a lot of new people on the call, maybe just a quick round of intros. I'm Nick Kumar, I'm a principal technical consultant at Domo, been here about four years. I've been a Domo customer for two years before that, and I started my career in corporate finance, FP a essentially. So, yeah, we've developed, you know, finance data products at Domo. So, I think that was one of the reasons to set up this meeting and just see where that might Qlik and have some.
Robert A: Value for your team.
Nik K: Do you want to do intros on your side real quick?
Robert A: In very brief, I'm Robert archer. I'm a senior accountant at pharmacann as there's a lot of accounting on this call. Been here for three years. I don't want to count. It feels like much longer?
Superior C: I'm Michael o'connell I'm the assistant controller.
Kris C: Chris Carlson senior accountant. So you got a lot more accounting guys on here today?
Robert A: Josiah bishop, staff accountant. I work with inventory.
Claire D: Claire dardano. I'm the controller. We have so many accountants on because all of these guys are great at like data analytics working kind of within our system. And so I thought as opposed to me, who is, you know, I, you know, can I can report gap but I think these guys are probably a lot better place to have things kind of Qlik for where we can get some incremental improvements in our day to day and our month on closing processes. And then Noah isn't on but he's our accounting manager works in inventory ap and some other stuff too. So. Perfect.
Nik K: Yeah. And I'm glad you brought the bigger team, yes, as we get into really the goal is to understand what your analytics requirements are, what you kind of do with the finance data today. So it'll be very helpful for the hands on folks to contribute. So… I don't know if there was, if you got a chance to see the finance data product, we'd quickly shown it to the, to Dave and team, but we can do a quick walkthrough of what that is and then we can talk about any customizations and requirements you have.
Dave: I think that would be good. Nick. We just basically primed the team with like, you know, hey here here, there are some things you guys already have put together that we'd like to go through. And then just, you know, we've shared our data instance. And then, you know, what more could we do to make this more usable for a broader team? Maybe outside of just these folks, which has been kind of a long term goal of ours on the finance team? Like we said, we've made some improvements of getting better adoption of the production teams, the sales teams, understanding the PL, but I think there's more we can do there hopefully to make it a little easier for them to intake and digest as well as we move forward. But primarily where we're at is what we talked to, you know, we moved all of, our business not business central, our old Power BI dashboards into Domo. We've changed the layout of a few of them to make things easier. But I think broadly speaking finance team at this point, you're pretty much getting in there to get the data out in a raw format and then manipulating from there. So what we kind of want to talk about is besides what's Domo's already got pre canned. Like how can we help make some more of that work automated through Domo for you? So that it's not all necessarily just pulling the data out but also getting done some of the work ahead of time for you?
Nik K: Awesome. So let me pull up the data product. And so this is what we call finance essentials, right? To sit on top of an ERP system and be able to report on your P LS and your balance sheet, and then an exact summary, which kind of pulls together both of those in something that's more digestible by the business. So I'll start with just a PL. So we start with, you know, you can do analysis for any period obviously, but the ability to compare to budget. If you have budget and forecast separately, we can add that in compared to last year, next year. And then if you want to do analysis on different timeframes, you have flexibility to do that. The product comes with three kind of core dimensions available and we generically name them dimm, one, two three. It really can be broken out by how you track the business, right? So maybe it's department, maybe it's state, maybe it's product category, but you have the flexibility to define those dimensions and then just some key scorecards on revenue over different time periods and how it's moved versus the comparison that was chosen net income. And then we do this is AI generated commentary on top of the data, right? So this can be modified to really call out the pieces you're interested in. But in this demo, what we're doing is just overall, tell me what's happened to my revenue, net income and what kind of drove that movement. And then we break it out with the comparisons and what were the key drivers based on the dimensions that kind of go into it? And so this is a process that could run kind of monthly, right? And just start the commentary process. And then business can come in and start adding more commentary on top. It's like, okay, well, if APAC region went up, what really drove that, right?

Hey, what's happening? How much man? How are you? It's Friday?
Michael N: You guys are three hours closer to the end of Friday than I am.
Dale W: I don't know if that's a good thing. I mean, maybe, but it just means more crap sausage between now and five, I think.
Michael N: Yeah. Well, I told, I just spoke to bill. I said, hey, just so, you know, I'm booking out early today because it is my 20 seventh anniversary. Wow, 27, 27.
Dale W: You know what kind of special.
Michael N: Person it takes to stay with me for 27 years.
Dale W: I was going to say you're going to a sainthood nomination for your life?
Michael N: Yeah… yeah. Even my friends, like all the guys I grew up with, they're like, how did she do it? I'm like, I don't know. I just don't know it's easy for me. Not easy for her that's right?
Dale W: Don't ask questions.
Michael N: That's right? I don't… so brader should be here. He accepted. I know he's running from another meeting, but the rationale behind this, Dan is Dale's trying to get a sense of how you guys run this, the mlrgv… thing, just the processes it runs through, so… he can get a sense of how that works because Dale, you're going to build some other stuff off of this, right? Some ancillary things also.
Dale W: Yeah. Basically, you know, what we're kind of under right? Is coming… into this acquisition. We're… trying to at least have go from vaporware to concepts and a majority of these things. And Adobe… about two weeks ago, it's not fully live yet, but they notified everybody that's coming. They're dropping a brand compliance AI… and I'm sure it's going to be garbage because Adobe doesn't think enterprise and, yada, blah, blah, but I want to be able to respond. And so I don't want to get in the way of all of the work you've done, but I think there's components of it that I can leverage and learn from to at least have some type of POC marker out there for what we have because what their brand manager is doing is you manually have to create a brand and if you look at the demo, it says it opens up with not many people create brands. So, not a lot of people need to have access to this and you're like we have thousands of these damn things.
Michael N: Not many people create brands.
Dale W: Right. Like whoa, who did you aim this at? So?
Michael N: One of the things that we were talking about Dale is incorporating in this platform, the ability to check against brand, right? Brand guidelines.
Dale W: Yeah. And so I think the way because in this arc and I haven't had a chance to send over the requirements. But here, let me show you kind of the piece of this that I do have. Give me a second. Here, I'll just share with you. I leaned into, some AI tools to help me compose this thing. Here's. Kind of the piece I think is that it, yeah, that's it. All right. So this is what I'm aiming for in this compliance agent. And I think the arc for compliance versus some of the regulatory, I've left some hooks for this regulatory compliance and the clinical language analysis that I know we've talked about for years and some of the chunking there that you were looking at there's a lot of these things that I think we can build some basic, call outs, some basic, core for what I've got in these knowledge layers, get to cause I've got this nice arc about brand maturity, which kind of proved out some of the things that, Kyle was even talking about. But I think if we attack this thing from multiple angles, then we can probably learn from each other as we kind of work on this thing too. Yep. But that's kind of where I'm trying to go. And I think too then it also helps me with, if I can take, some of these pieces, then I can move into what I've argued internally is what agencies especially on the production side need to become of more of a product instead of a service. And so, as we have this arc and we're training, brand knowledge, we're taking copy, we're taking components of this thing. And we're saying this is on brand with this audience with this thing, regionality, et cetera, your derivative content. And then your regionalization localization content can be automatically generated with very few interactions because, you know, what the brand is at that point. All right. So that's kind of where we're targeting with this thing. And so, I just wanted to kind of, you know, spend a few minutes diving a little deeper into the darker nerd side of how you've set this up. I saw the pieces of like workflow, jupyter, notebooks and things like that. But I didn't get all of the details of like how the mechanics of how this machine turns.
Dan G: Yeah, no, no, no, that's fine. Let me just bring a couple pieces up and I can kind of show you the components here. All right. I think this should do it. And to be told, I think there's ways that as we look at implementation, we could do different things a little bit differently just as, you know, kind of going through the process here… so you can see my screen. Okay? Yep. All right. Where are we? So we got this is your orchestrator for all intents and purposes. You know, when I showed you guys the ugly app, you know, the front end, it was all driven from this start mlr POC form, but obviously we want to have something cleaner prettier nicer for people to work with that's more intuitive, you know, prompt library where they can hit a dropdown or whatnot, and we can just create refine and store prompts. So obviously that'll be an enhancement on the front end is just the ability to start with prompts and then obviously enhance them or change them if we want. So this takes advantage of file sets. Have you played around with those yet?
Dale W: I want to, okay. But I'm gun shy because there's the documentation that's on the developer website. And then there's how it actually works.
Dan G: Yep. I feel your pain went through the fire now.
Dale W: While you have direct access to the engineers to go, what the fuck? I don't and so I will build something. And then it's just going to go.

William W: Well, I'm traveling this week so you're not hurting me by not making it happen so quick, man. So.
Ted S: Sounds good.
William W: Hey, when for that? Because I'm going to start working, I'm going to get back in there and work later on in the week. Do you want me to split that so that they're using the current version or do you mind them being in a working like thing?
Ted S: I don't know that it may to me, it can just be pretty rough for them. I think I'm still just looking for generalities of what info should be displayed. So if it's not the latest and greatest that's probably not an issue.
William W: Cool. All right. Cool.
Juliana J: Cool. All right. So today, first thing we wanted to talk about was some follow up questions on skills matrix. So I will pass it over to Nick should be able to go over that.
Brian F: Well, I got actually that's fine. I don't know Nick. I do have an example… of some questions that we have because I don't know that it was worded quite right? Or it's just hard. Sorry, I didn't mean to throw you under the bus. Juliana, it's just kind of hard to describe. So looking at the skill matrix. So this is all data that's coming out of the skills matrix app. So this is where all the, this is the data set I'm showing you is from here. This is all the data and all the joining that's happening just from the data that is getting put into the skills currently put in the skills matrix. We have situations like this specifically for this like five axis laser operator is a good example. So we have a role id. We have a skill id, but there is no skill name associated with it. And the issue with that is if we don't have any of this other information or if it doesn't join, then we don't have that, the learning id and we don't we can't it doesn't join to anything else. So does that make sense? Ted?
Ted S: Yes, I just honestly, I probably do need to see if I can pull Tyson in just so he can make sure I'm not sending you down the wrong path. If you just give me two seconds, I'll see if I can steal him for a second. If not, I'll try to give you my best info.
Brian F: Okay.
Ted S: Don't leave them.
Nik K: Brian, while he's doing that, there are two of the raw data sets that come out of the app. That kind of show what might be happening. So he can pull those up too if needed. So.
Brian F: You're doing these.
Nik K: Yeah. If you open up the skills and the first one and the third one?
Ted S: Yeah, yeah, yeah. I just grabbed Tyson here so we can probably jump back to that same table that you had pulled up.
Brian F: Yep. Oh, sorry. Give me, of course, give me one second. Luckily, I've got a speedway… around this. Okay. What's happening coming out of the skills matrix is that there are some role id. I think it's the skill id that's not joining up to anything. And so when that happens, we have a role name, but we don't have a skill name. And if we don't have, if we're not joining at this point, we don't have a learning id and we can't get to a, then we can't join it to a person, which means it doesn't get assigned to anybody.
Ted S: Brian, did you receive my email? Did that make sense?
Brian F: Apparently not because I was like, well, maybe I didn't explain it well, and you're like I sent an email on it and I thought I'd explain it. So I think we're missing each other here a little bit. So I'm sorry. Did.
Ted S: you get my email at all though?
Brian F: I did. Okay.
Ted S: Okay. That's all it was. I'm not saying my email made sense. I'm saying when I just want to make sure that you at least saw that.
Brian F: Yeah, I did.
Ted S: Okay. So I… want to get terminology, right? So that way I'm following along, can you go to the app itself? And so I understand that I named things different in my explanation to you. I can't even remember what vocabulary I used off the top of my head, but I think I called it like skill. And then, so… again, if you go to, I think you go to skills… yeah. And then levels. So see the gtawonezeroone, the seven skill levels. I think you have to Qlik on the levels… and you scroll down.

Mark L: Hey, Mike. How are you?
Michael N: I'm well, how about yourself? Doing good. Awesome. I've been having all kinds of zoom issues this morning. Say that again, I've been having all kinds of zoom issues this morning. Oh, they upgraded, they updated their system. So now they're trying to jam AI in it. Wow. Oh, my God. Come on, man. Hey, Carl.

Karl A: Oh, sorry. I was muted. I put the mute on. Hi, everyone.
Mark L: Hey, how are you Carl?
Karl A: Yeah, good. Thanks. How about you guys?
Michael N: Good. Did you have a good weekend?
Karl A: Yeah, it was all right. We went to central park yesterday, I was going to, we were going to hire a bike to go through the park, but I forgot an id, so we couldn't hire it in the end. So we just walked.
Michael N: It's beautiful this time of year.
Karl A: It was nice. It was extremely nice. Yes, I'm glad that we were, we ended up walking instead of riding because, you know, if you're cycling then you can only go along the main track, but if you're walking, you can go to all the different parts.
Michael N: Yeah. Did they have, they always have something going on, but did they have concerts happening yesterday?
Karl A: I didn't I mean, there's always people playing. I'm not sure if there was a concert per SE, but they do have like a pickleball court in the middle now, like where the ice rink is. So we had a look at that.
Michael N: You have to, if they have a like a festival show in there or a bigger show, you have to go. It's the, it's a great spot to watch a concert.
Karl A: Oh, yeah. Okay. The summer stage, yeah, we did walk past that. I think there was something playing there because we heard music coming from it, but we didn't go up and have a closer look.
Michael N: Yeah, there's always something going on there.
Karl A: Yeah, that was nice.
Michael N: So, mark, is Shane able to join you think?
Mark L: I sure hope. So, he's kind of the show here. Hey, Joe.
Michael N: Joe.
Mark L: Let me send him a text.
Joe P: Hello, everyone.
Michael N: There he is. Hey, Shane.
Mark L: Hey, Shane.
Shane W: Hey, guys.
Michael N: All right. I think we got everyone. I think we got a quorum. So, Carl, the first part there you are. So, you know, we've got this program going on with Shane and mark to help with adoption and help identify and understand new use cases. Sure, and help bring those to life with Domo. Could you, I know we touched on this last week but I know you had some thoughts on some things. Do you want to bring the team up to speed on kind of what you're thinking?
Karl A: Well, let's talk about what Delray is on Friday first. Okay. And let me share my screen and I'll show you the way things are currently working here. Can you see my screen?
Michael N: Not yet. Oh.
Karl A: I must have clicked the wrong thing. One second. Let me try again. How about now?
Michael N: Yep.
Karl A: All right. So this is a sort of a high level view of the instance architecture that we have here at ipg health. As you can see, we have the main ipg health instance, and then we have some agency instances. And then we also have some customer instances as well. We've taken this approach because we wanted to separate away where people can develop. We have for example, some very sensitive data in the ipg health instance. We don't want any risks around editors and privileged people accidentally getting access to that from the agency. So we've created like a trio instance. Trio is an agency in the ipg health brand. So they have their own instance just as solved. Is also I think classified as an agency and they have their own instance as well. Here are the use cases that we have. As you can see there's a couple of speaker bureau use cases. And there we have trebia who's one of our end users. They're a customer of ipg health. And galderman, also a customer of ipg health. And then for, we also sorry, we also have a third customer using a speaker bureau that is CSL, but CSL is also using a marketing use case from solve. Anyway, the reason I'm showing you this is because we would like an easier way for our users to access their instances right now. They're just logging into them directly. We do have single sign on turned on for like the trio instance and the solved instance. But we'd like to look at using the identity broker, whatever it's called to give everyone one URL, where they can access all Domo instances from, no matter who they are.
Michael N: Chain thoughts.
Shane W: Seems fairly standard.
Michael N: so how do we help with that? Or can we help with that? I should say.
Shane W: Yeah, I think we could help with that.
Michael N: Okay. So what? So from that call, so what's your thought on? How… do you have any idea of how you want to approach that?
Karl A: Well, were you able to find any of the identity broker, stuff that Mamta shared with us last… year? When I say us, I mean, back when I was with Domo and we were having these conversations with Dale?
Michael N: Yeah, I don't have access to any of that. Do you, was that something that she had with you?
Karl A: Well, something she is, she still with Domo? She is right. Yeah, yeah, I mean, I'm sure you can just ask her for it, cause, that will sort of explain like I guess a bit more of the architecture that we need here. I think that. So there's questions, right? Questions around how we implement it include where we're going to host it, because as I understand it, we may need to put it into some sort of third party portal or maybe like a, I don't know a sharepoint or something that's one of my questions. Another question is how are we going to handle the different types of users? For example, you know, the trio people like all of the ipg health employees have a single sign on but the customers are not on our single sign on. So how are we going to handle them accessing this portal as well?
Shane W: Would it make sense to use like clearsquare's… portal that they have?
Karl A: The, what? Sorry?
Shane W: Clearsquare, clearsquare, they have a portal that they basically does that type of authentication and, you know, user management and what people have access to especially, I mean, f",Consumption Pricing Model,549500.3,Enterprise,IPGHEALTH.COM,4,Media,24,$5M to <$10M,Upsell,Blank,Closed Lost,Michael Napoli,2025-08-06,2024-11-18,2024-11-18,2024-11-18,,,,2025-08-06,0015w00002a1T9QAAU

Can you hear me okay?

Michael N: Okay. I'll ping Dale, see if he's still able to join you're.
John M: fine. I'm very okay with him being late. I'd like to finish what I'm doing here.
Michael N: So, and I got a split. I'll pick up on my phone. I'll drop off and pick up on my phone, but I got a doctor's appointment that I got to drive to, okay? Here it comes. Hey, Dale, long time, no speak.

Michael N: I can… only imagine… I.
John M: Don't know if it's not to me.
Dale W: Yeah, I'm safe this time.
Michael N: I have a feeling, I think I know who it's to. So, Dale, I wanted to, I told John that you had built out some stuff over the weekend. Was it last weekend already? Yeah, seems like forever ago, but last weekend… and he just wanted to do a he'd love to see it, see what you did. Let's discuss it and let's, see, what this does to maybe alter what we're going to do or talk through those things.
Dale W: Sounds good. Let me. so, what… I put together, I took… a subset of, I followed the same design pattern that you guys have as far as endpoint to call a workflow calls a, jupyter notebook does the work and then comes back right cool. The way I built it inside of workfront and the app builder framework it requires. So this app is connected to workfront and Domo. And what it's doing is this table is getting built based off the context of this project. You can get that context into the app. The app then is querying the workfront API to get a list of documents identifying the ones that have these proofs available in it. And we'll go ahead and kick this off because this is brand new. Let's see how they're doing and what it's doing is firing that workflow. The workflow is calling the prompt using the generate it's harvesting data from workfront and specifically proof and what it's doing is finding themes. So, like out of this, we can pull the different comments. It's categorizing comments. It's finding the different levels of insert and different changes that it's expecting. Yeah, the cross checks like trying to figure out what's happening, skipping to the end, trying to summarize, and this is where the prompt I'm still working a little bit on it, but like what exactly is expected to change? So the comment reply relationship of inferring where the changes are across the pages, across the coordinates and everything else.
John M: Yeah.
Dale W: So that's what I've got that's what I'm running through. Now, I have my new one. But yeah, I mean, pretty basic pattern, right? Of just harvesting a whole bunch of data, throwing it at a massive prompt. I did notice with the prompt itself that when you're doing generate it doesn't like a prompt template. Yeah, that was kind of fun because like when I was doing summarize the prompt template, was all of this stuff, right? And then the prompt was here's, the data like a very basic data thing. Whenever I gave it a prompt template, plus a prompt. It said, I'm waiting for the data, I can do what you want me to just give me the data. I'm like that is the data, right?
John M: Okay.
Dale W: So that was kind of fun. So this.
John M: Is kind of a bug that you had to work through.
Dale W: Yep. But so, you know, we simplified it down, we're you know, still refining because you don't have as much refinement when it's all in the prompt, but we're working through anti hallucination rules and some formatting things to make sure your Json is at least 90 percent of the way there. All right. But it's coming back out sweet. But, yeah. So that's it that's our magical flow.
John M: Yeah, this is awesome. So, did.
Dale W: That work… it did. So… have you?
John M: Tried testing this like against production?
Dale W: Yeah, this is production, this is.
John M: A production thing assets. Okay.
Dale W: So, this, because this proof just came in an hour ago. So, okay. Yeah.
John M: So, what do we need to do to roll this out?
Dale W: I just need to test the… two things one, the way that the app extensions use Adobe I o, for proxy to get around cores. I need to make sure that I didn't violate any security policies along the way.
Michael N: They're just suggestions anyway.
Dale W: Yeah.
John M: Security. Okay. Yeah, that's a good idea to review that all.
Dale W: Right. But other than that, I think the other piece of it to kind of call out is in this raw data set inside of the components of these coordinates because you get coordinates for free inside of the comment data set itself. Yeah. And so what I think the next marriage in my mind, the marriage is summarize the comment reply sequence to figure out if it's done or not semantically. And then from that piece, then you can match the coordinates to say this is the change that I'm expecting in this area on a page with this coordinate and feeding that in as a dataset input to version comparison. Okay? That makes sense. Following my logic.
John M: Yes. And no. Okay. One of the questions is like, okay, well, how is an end user supposed to know a coordinate? I know how to find a coordinate on a GPS. Well, they draw a box. I don't know how to find a coordinate on a document, but I'm assuming, you know, and that's what's important, right? You want to teach me? Go ahead, but I don't know if it's necessary.
Dale W: The user draws a box, right? Okay. Or circles it or puts an arrow in the general area, right? I think that's a little bit more of the semantics too. But so if you work through the construct of either it's in a box or it's pointed to. So I know the generalized area and then feeding that semantically to the next one to learn from it to say, in general, this is the expected outcome change here's. What it was here's. What it is, you agree, right? Yep. At what confidence interval? Yeah… ciao.
John M: Yeah. Is there anything we can do to help you roll this out?
Dale W: No, I think, you know, from just the… lessons learned in prompting and some of the just interacting with the models.
John M: Yeah.

Jayden C: what's new? That word doesn't exist over here? Really, really not much… are we haven't moved anything at all. Most of our focus has been hands down kind of launching buildings. Still, we're still very focused on just making sure our buildings are launched versus anything else. So… there really is a bit much. I… am starting to look internally at some other opportunities outside of this role. So… if that happens, I'll explain those roles to you guys, but we will see… there's really not much from my side at all.
Michael D: Sorry to hear that. I know it can be frustrating especially when you were starting to find, your groove in using Domo and the opportunities that came with it. So let us know if there's anything we can do. I know searching internally has its own list of issues and problems but I'll keep my ear to the street. If I hear anything outside, I'll definitely let you know as well as it relates to Domo. We usually get postings where people are looking for people that have Domo experience. So if there's anything that comes across, I'll definitely float it your way. If, if you're interested, sure.
Jayden C: Is.
Michael D: there anything that you're interested in? Even though there may not be an applicable use case right now within your department that we either haven't covered or you'd like to dive deeper into?
Jayden C: I haven't been in Domo in a while. I guess what if I miss what's new? Well?
Michael D: That's a loaded.
Jason J: Question. And I am out. Yeah, I, I'm out of the building or out of the parking garage now. So, I can hear again, but please continue, yeah.
Michael D: I was going to say, from… our discussions things that I know that you guys are not taking advantage of yet would be AI workflows. Like those pro code apps. I mean, that's where everyone's moving right now in terms of just building support for… their use cases with these low code apps and integrating AI and agentic solutions within them that have really been powerful in terms of what they're able to produce and allow people to do and kind of free up their time.
Jason J: And I, that's where everything's headed. Right now. The biggest thing I brought up about that we started talking about last week was how do I tell the gemini model that I am home depot? Because they, we've been approved to use gemini, but it like we have our own contracts with our like our privacy stuff that they've built and are comfortable with and I needed to like basically use our gemini account, right? Is, I think the way that it will go.
Zachary O: I have a feeling I've asked our team's AI experts. We haven't had any real call for that kind of a use case. So I am planning on bringing this up today in our sag group, strategic architecture group to see if that is a planned update. What I mean? The person who runs it is fantastic with AI, and he'll probably have a good idea of, what we need but if push comes to shove, I'm putting it in as an enhancement request, Mike, I'll ping you on it too.
Michael D: So, right now, I mean, so Zach, just to make sure I'm understanding when we think about our AI service later, things like openai, databricks, nova anthropic, we just need to get gemini added.
Zachary O: No, gemini is in there. It's just that the ability to go and impersonate or identify as Jason's gemini account say, okay, all these queries and everything like this. It's not going through Domo's gemini, it's going through home depot's gemini to log all the requests.
Michael D: Got it. Okay.
Zachary O: That's how I'm understanding it. Jason tell me if I'm wrong?
Jason J: Correct. Nope. You're 100 percent, right? Yeah. And, I, I'd be shocked if that doesn't my guess would be more people just haven't gotten to the point, but I'd be shocked, if that doesn't become a bigger issue because I mean, what company doesn't want to use their own contracts? Yeah, with stuff like that.
Zachary O: Yeah. Okay.

Karl A: Hello?
Joe P: Hey, Carl, long time, no talk.
Karl A: Yeah, all of 10 minutes.
Joe P: Carl, I need to ask how many times did you go hiking in Utah? You know, you lived in one of the best places in the world to go hiking and it took you moving to New York to go hiking? Yeah, many times. Oh, good. Okay?
Karl A: The big ones there. Yeah.
Joe P: Yeah, yeah. Oh, thank goodness. Okay.
Karl A: In fact, I did a couple of them several times… but the problem with the Utah hikes is that I don't think that you like all the big ones there's. No way you can get to without a car.
Joe P: Oh, that's true.
Michael N: And super hilly, right? A lot of altitude climbs.
Joe P: In Utah?
Michael N: Yeah.
Karl A: Yeah.
Joe P: Yeah. For the most part, you're climbing?
Karl A: Definitely. Yeah. Look, the Utah ones were very good. We did like a nice one in arches. I can't remember what it's called, but in the arches park, you can do the hike around and get to all of the different arches.
Joe P: Yeah, I love arches.
Karl A: Yeah. That one was like seven Miles. I think actually there's a part in the park where you have to walk across like a reasonably thin, I guess like, I don't know a bit of rock and if you fall down either side, you're going to die. And my wife was really upset when we got to that point. She managed to make it across. I think she crawled across but, yeah, that's like that's one of her unfonded memories of that park.
Joe P: Yeah, that takes some of the fun out of it. What do you think you're going to die?
Michael N: I do not do well with like cliff heights like that. I can do altitude as long as there's lots of room that I'm not going to fall off a cliff but some of the stuff Joe that I see like bowerly sends me that he snowboards.
Joe P: Oh, yeah, it's insane.
Michael N: Insanity.
Joe P: yeah, it's insane.
Michael N: I was actually thinking while we're waiting for, Dale said he's going to be a few minutes. Joe. I was actually thinking of buying a snowboard get up this year.
Joe P: Yeah.
Michael N: Seeing if I can get these old legs.
Joe P: Of course. You, can. You're totally fit.
Michael N: I love the sensation of just carving a huge turn.
Joe P: Yeah… you don't get that on skiing. I've never become a good skier. So maybe you get to the point that you can. But when that edge locks in on a snowboard and you feel the GS push into it, there's no better feeling than.
Michael N: That, yeah, yeah. And I did it a while ago years ago, but have not been on it since it just seems like it's as you get older. It's much more comfortable to walk around in those boots.
Joe P: Oh, yeah. 100 percent. Yeah. Do you have places out there? Cause I guess what would be the closest to you? Tahoe?
Michael N: Tahoe? Yeah, I.
Joe P: mean, do you have places where you can just do a season rental?
Michael N: Oh, yeah.
Joe P: Yeah. You don't have to invest a 1,000 dollars into the whole thing.
Michael N: Yep. Yeah. And I would, my whole thing is buy boots, new, yes, and then rent or buy used board and bindings usually get them cheap.
Joe P: Yeah. The boots are the important one for sure. Yeah. I think my son's gonna finally buy a setup this year, cause I think he's finally done growing or at least close to, he's 16. So he's gonna, but I've been just buying or renting demo packages for him every year for the past eight years. I think, he's gonna finally buy something this year.
Michael N: That's awesome.
Joe P: I can't keep up with him anymore. He doesn't and I don't think he wants me to go with him anymore, either. So, but thanks, bro, leave your dad behind.
Michael N: Yeah. Well, you can keep up with him, right? No.
Joe P: Absolutely. Not.
Michael N: Really?
Joe P: Cause he does stupid stuff like he, I mean, he can straight bomb like the black diamonds at snowbird, right? He hits like 55 Miles per hour. I'm like, no, Jesus, nope. I'll be back here. I, I'm off to the side in the moguls, cause I don't want to pick up too much speed and I'll see you in four minutes, yeah, but he grew up, riding at snowbird. He doesn't he doesn't know any different. So he got really good, from being there, so, and.
Michael N: It's pretty steep there.
Joe P: Oh, yeah. Snowbird is, steep. Yeah.
Michael N: I could ski anything, but I really, I really want to learn to board better.
Joe P: Yeah. Well, cool. Let's go hit it this winter.
Michael N: Yeah, for sure. So, Cole, while we're waiting for Dale, anything else on your side?
Karl A: No, I look, I mean, we're going to speak next week, and I guess we can talk about some of the stuff then. I guess… no, no, not really.
Michael N: You're still set getting back into the swing of things. Did you just come back Tuesday?
Karl A: Yes.
Michael N: Wow, yeah, it's the first week back is just, it's hard.
Karl A: Yeah, but to catch up, but, but yeah, like it's good stuff. It's been achieved this week. Some of the, we're getting some of the new data in, from advantage so that I think will be, that will be very nice to automate that. We're using jupyter to do that. So I've been learning how to use chatgpt to help me write a connector.
Michael N: How is it?
Karl A: It's great. The connector that I wrote is bloody flawless.
Michael N: I was wondering, cause I don't I've not worked a lot with, with AI, but I was wondering, is Claude better than chatgpt for writing code?
Karl A: I mean, people say that, but I don't know. I've never, I haven't tried Claude.
Michael N: I haven't either. I've used gemini and chatgpt and pretty much that's it.
Karl A: Yeah, I find it very difficult to swap to using a different tool, a different AI tool, especially one that has all of my, like contextual history in it.
Michael N: Yeah.
Joe P: Are you relatively comfortable doing that kind of stuff like to begin with, or were you brand new to it with AI?

Vince W: I'm surprised they didn't ask you for a social insurance number? I.
James L: Know, right?
Vince W: Or social security. I think that's what they call in the us. Yeah.
Benjamin P: Will Molly be here? Will it just be you?
James L: Today, James? It's just gonna be me today. She's off today, so.
Benjamin P: That's okay. I think that this won't be super long. We may not even need the full 30 minutes. So, I know the week… before last, I think is the last time we met, I said I was gonna try to get this proposal to you last week, but it took a little longer than we anticipated, but I don't know if you've met Vince or not. Vince is on our solutions team and helps put together these proposals. And so, he's gone through, he's created this proposal. That is again just a formality on our side to review what we've discussed so far and just to get signed off on your end that, yes, this looks good. This is what we wanna proceed with. And then we'll continue building out the lead management app that we've discussed already. So, I've got that wireframe working on building out that user interface for you. So looking forward to showing that to you here in the near future. But today we'll primarily just be reviewing that proposed one and getting any questions that you have on your side from that. So, does that sound good?
James L: Yeah, sounds great.
Benjamin P: All right. Be fairly.
James L: Quick.
Vince W: Yeah. Hopefully this is pretty quick and James, nice to meet you. As Ben mentioned before, I'm the director of service solutions. So I will forward you this afterwards so you can kind of go through it. But as Ben probably mentioned to you, this is a no cost engagement, really kind of just looking to super boost your adoption of Domo and hopefully solve a bunch of pain points that you might have. Yeah. So I'll just skip through a lot of this stuff because some of it is just like, you know, our typical sow jargon there's some repetitiveness into this. But, you know, in our discovery of working with you guys, there's four main challenges here. First one being difficultly managing large volumes of customer calls that could lead into scheduling opportunities. Challenge. Number two, lack of visibility into how users engage the Domo platform challenge, number three, limited Domo training for new doctors. And then four forecasting and influencing doctor compensation is manual and time consuming. So, you know, really there's four buckets here. You know, the first one being a lead management app, creation of app, a doctor compensation tool, user engagement dashboard, and then some onboarding courses which will, you know, show you how to do it. But ultimately from building the course that's on you guys. So in terms of the solution and this is really a summary of everything. And I'll just skip that because I'll go into the main slides. But this kind of just showing how we work from an implementation methodology perspective. You know, with every engagement, we have a solution architecture design process… where we go in and basically put together the blueprints of what we're actually going to do for you, which I believe Ben is pretty much ready to go. If not started already. I'll kind of skip the next couple of slides because it's very illustrative and really get into the first use case. So, the first one being the lead management app, their goal is really to increase appointments that are scheduled. So our solution will work and build a pro code app for managing these calls either via app studio. We put together a workflow integration where we use Domo to trigger a lot of alerts and the follow up tasks. And we have a reporting layer that we create dashboards for call volume, trends, lead conversion rates and missed opportunities with the expected outcome of increasing the conversion rate of the inbound calls for scheduled appointments. I'll switch to Alicia.
Benjamin P: James, does that pretty much summarize what we discussed? Yeah, it's.
James L: hitting really well.
Vince W: Okay, perfect.
James L: Very nice powerpoint by the way. Sorry, very nice powerpoint. I like visuals. It's professional.
Vince W: Yeah, I'm a visual person as well. The next one is the doctor compensation tool. So I think I spelled more transparent nor transparent, more transparent compensation and planning solution, really easier compensation forecasting through the forecasting tool. So we'll build a forecasting app for you that basically uses dynamic variables. So you'll be able to use almost like a slider to kind of understand how much compensation you get as a doctor. We'll integrate your embedded business logic that's in there. We'll have really cool interactive visualizations, so people can actually see how much they're getting compensated with the expected outcome of being faster more transparent from a compensation perspective.
Benjamin P: James just real quickly. If I do recall, you guys are not using app studio very much today, correct?
James L: We're not, no.
Benjamin P: Okay, cool. So with all of these solutions primarily talking about the compensation tool and the lead management app, we typically… prefer to put those within app studio because the experience is just better for the user. And so, if, for some reason you do want to use standard dashboards, let us know, but we're going to opt to put those in app studio if you're okay with that.
James L: Yeah, I think we're great with that.
Benjamin P: Awesome.
James L: Although, correct me if I'm wrong, when you build an app, typically, the output could be put into a card which could be put on a regular dashboard, but it sounds like it works better with app studio as well.
Benjamin P: I wouldn't say that it works any better or worse in terms of a pro code app inside of a dashboard or an app studio app. But app studio has some additional features regarding ",Consumption Pricing Model,50000.0,Corporate,RISASDENTAL.COM,8,Healthcare & Health Services,74,$10M to <$25M,Renewal,Blank,2: Determine Needs,Jennee Moore,2026-04-23,2023-03-17,2023-03-17,,,,,,0013800001GuYNAAA3

Vu N: Hey, ash. I only have 30 minutes today.
Aishwarya D: Okay.
Vu N: Is there any? Yeah, Eric should be going.
Aishwarya D: Okay. Gu, just a heads up. We have excluded Elliot's Ng, mechanical services from all the data sets. So that's what we agreed upon. Just want to make sure. So I don't know if you excluded it from the source, but we have still taken care of it and excluded from the data flows.
Vu N: Yep. Yeah, I should have excluded it from the source.
Aishwarya D: Okay. I guess lead mechanical services wasn't coming through. Hey, Eric.
Eric G: Hey, sorry, Brian's, not going to make it today and I have not followed up on the Tustin thing yet. We're kind of heads down with some budget prep stuff. So we'll leave that item open but keep moving, sorry.
Aishwarya D: I just wanted to confirm, did you remove Elliot's as well?
Vu N: Yep. Removed Elliot's and mac services. Okay? Ashley, you just want to share your screen so we can just walk it through? Yeah.
Aishwarya D: Let me know if you can see it.
Vu N: Yep. We got it. Yeah.
Aishwarya D: Lou, just a heads up. I haven't imported the dashboard. It's just a one Qlik thing to do in app studio. Just wanted to make sure because we'll be duplicating the cards, right? So just want to make sure we have the cards in good shape here with the numbers or any filters if you want to add anything. And then I can import it.
Vu N: Okay. That's fine. Oh, yeah. So I think the action items for this table, we can go top to bottom. This one was since Ge, mac services and Elliott's… are excluded. I think year to date. It seems… correct except for budgets.
Eric G: Yeah. I think this is still probably to some degree the Tustin… issue and maybe a couple other small issues. I noticed this before that this one doesn't exactly tie out. We may have to, I may have to Brian and I'd like dig in a little bit further to understand why, but it's pretty close.
Vu N: Yeah. And the formatting?
Aishwarya D: Is now in place for all the cards?
Vu N: Cool. Perfect. Another issue with this? Revenue like it's like point one, six point… one, six and a half.
Eric G: Yeah, that was the kind of the thing I was mentioning yesterday, it like where it, and I think we said it was related to sagitta group somehow, but like when we took Ge mechanical services out for some reason, it impacted sagitta because it ties before you remove. So it was like a weird thing where the budget is right after you remove it for a Quilla group. But then the actuals end up being off by, I couldn't figure out why that happened.
Vu N: Yeah. I know what it is. The few TCS locations. I just haven't… thought of the good way to correct it. It's just like adding it to the reference map got what values was. So that one, I know what the issue is. Okay. Anything else should match there? I can't.
Aishwarya D: I had a question on the sorting for group names. Do you have anything specific set? Because this is just a to Z right now. Actually, it's not… but do you have a preference? What was that?
Vu N: We would put Astra at the bottom?
Eric G: Yeah, that's true. That's right? Because it's its own sort of separate thing.
Aishwarya D: And everything else?
Eric G: I think the rest can be alphabetical, okay? Because we wouldn't sort it by dollars because then you'd be out of order in various sections. So I think that's fine.
Aishwarya D: Okay. Should I move on or wait on this card?
Vu N: Yeah, we can move on. Any of the issues would appear on the top. I'm just going to debug it. This was prior year, correct? Yeah, prior year. It matches… everything up. You can go to the bottom.
Eric G: Yeah, I think we've already done the.
Vu N: Margins. Yeah. All.
Eric G: right. So the budget year to date was what was off before? And I think you fixed that yesterday.
Aishwarya D: Yeah.
Eric G: Yeah. There's still the same issue up top that we've got to figure out that like 1,000,000 and change 1,000,000 and a half on the op. It's off like all P. L lines. It must be again some sort of like tuck in acquisition or something doesn't tie, but that's okay. I think that's minor.
Vu N: Go down to DSL. I think DSL should… match.
Eric G: Yeah, we've got that issue again where we can't quite see both numbers for June. There we go. That matches.
Vu N: That… matches now. Did we say five year was incorrect? Yeah.
Eric G: Yeah, that's is it? I think it was supposed to be like 66 or something. Let me go back and look, yeah, I have like 66 point seven and we thought this might be related to like the balance sheet noise.
Vu N: But, yeah.
Eric G: That one's still off?
Vu N: Should.
Aishwarya D: I move.
Vu N: On, yeah, keep going.
Eric G: These are all good. We checked these yesterday unless something changed… not much.
Vu N: The only things that changed were going to be network and capital and… network and capital. Yeah… I know… what the issues are network.
Eric G: Now, networking capital before we move on to netwhip, I do think… well, maybe we wait on this. Never mind until we validate it. Eventually, we've got to switch it to the change in networking capital. I just want to make sure that's easy to do.
Aishwarya D: Yeah, we have that card as well in place. I'll just show that to you. This was with the revenue annualized, the change is in a different card. Can we validate this first?
Eric G: Oh, that's right. You're right. Okay. You're right about that?

I'll just pull that in so we can clarify that as well. Yeah. Got it. Sharing the screen again. Let me know if you can see the mail.

Jenna H: You have no idea how much this just made my day. Oh, yep. Yep. Spencer. Thank you.
Spencer M: You're welcome. I knew it would be the highlight.
Jenna H: And I'm really glad this meeting was recorded so I can just play it over and over again that's.
Spencer M: a little creepy.
Jenna H: But I've missed Spencer so much… all right. So we've got a couple things today, mr, Spencer that we would like to talk to you about.
Spencer M: Okay.
Jenna H: Number one by chance. Did you happen to give Scott and I access to your instance yet? Or are you freezing us out?
Spencer M: Oh, I did that during the meeting last time you?
Jenna H: Did, why can we not find our emails? Let's find them. I don't see. Anything that says that?
Spencer M: Does it, not? Do you guys have that notification turned off? So it doesn't send us that you got demoed email there's. A chance. Okay. What's the URL? Thanks.
Jenna H: All right. Thank you, sir. Okay. That was number one, number two. Do you happen to have any? Insight as to what's happening with like the management leadership updates with your.
Spencer M: No, we haven't heard a single thing.
Jenna H: Okay. Because we would like to get something on the books at the very least where we're having a meeting with Kyle, your manager. Yeah, as well as you and Brian, and really would like to talk about apex's overall business goals. And so I didn't know aside from Kyle, who else we should invite with the current state of things?
Spencer M: That's a good question. So… from the business aspect, like do you want to speak with maybe some of the people from the teams that we're really facilitating the data for? Like we're talking like we're doing our HR data talk with someone that's kind of leading that spectrum or where do you want to even like one layer up from now? Like what's going to be the most useful for you?
Jenna H: So this is really to overall get a picture of apex companies, like what your business goals are for this current year? Like is it to increase revenue? Is it to, you know, spread your services to more areas? Is it to hire more employees? Like it could be from a number of things, but it's just like a really high level company focused business goal. So I didn't know if Kyle would have like some insight into that or if there would be other folks that we.
Spencer M: Should we'll probably have to go down the chain, I know some of the things we've been working a lot on are just employee turnover and making sure that our HR processes are more adept and aligned. So we've been doing a lot of revamping on that so that's like where Brian and I have been spending a lot of our time, but we'll definitely track down some people that have like here's where we're going.
Jenna H: Okay. Yeah, that would be also. I'd love to meet Kyle at the very least. So that is something that will be important for the roadmap purpose. But if you maybe have a preliminary talk with Kyle and just be like these nosy Domo folks want to know like what we're as a compa",Consumption Pricing Model,364855.2,Corporate,APEXCOS.COM,6,Professional Services,1069,$250M to <$500M,Renewal,Blank,2: Determine Needs,Bryant Masina,2027-10-01,2024-07-30,2024-07-30,,,,,,0015000000uKzrqAAC

Amrit shared his progress on various use cases, such as analyzing metric-based and text-based data, and the team provided guidance on saving work, maintaining context, and exploring options for more tailored chatbot experiences. The discussion also covered the potential for connecting to Google BigQuery and involving other team members, with plans to schedule a follow-up meeting in the coming weeks.","Phil S: Hey, what's up?
Amrit: Good afternoon… Phil. Good.
Phil S: Afternoon. Good to see you again.
Amrit: Yeah, same here. Great. We forgot to do it on teams. I remember zoom is a bit challenging for us but no worries. I managed to join. So, okay, no complaints. This time. Yes, I was like busy with your tool only, and then I suddenly realized, oh, it's past one o'clock and I need to join because typically, when it's a teams meeting, you get notifications right? Like, oh, we have a meeting now, yes.
Phil S: Sorry. Well, I think one of the end goals here, it'd be great, Ben. I'll let you kind of own that countervite, but we can do a teams meeting and we can do it recurring. That way we can have it set up. Sorry, it's default on our side to do zoom and I forget it a lot of times, but here we are.
Amrit: Yeah. So happy to get started. I think I have a hard stop at one 30. I know it's for one two,, one, two, but we'll try to utilize 30 minutes towards the best interest of our time. So, I did manage to spend time with the tool and like do something. What I intend to do, I think it works to begin with. Firstly. I do have some questions with respect to the things which I have been doing. And the first, and the foremost question is, how do I save? If I'm working on something? Because I was working on something. And second, and, let me try to share my screen. If I can… so I'll share your screen. Okay? I will share my entire screen. That's fine. Are you able to see my screen?
Benjamin P: Yes, I see zoom, see your zoom screen.
Amrit: Perfect. So, now, you see my Domo screen, are you familiar with this company called Domo?
Benjamin P: Yeah.
Amrit: Yeah. So now, how do I get this back? This is hiding. Yeah. So there… is one dataset which I uploaded and I was working with it. I'm trying to see. So what I did was I uploaded it. This is what we had seen some time back then went to the AI readiness section. And then within that, I don't… know where will I go if I have to edit my column for context? Edit all? Yeah, I think you're here. So if you see her here, I went there and I provided the context… et cetera, set up in terms of what it would be, what it does represent and things like that. And then I did save. So then back over here. Okay. Let us get what is this? Get started. I think there is this UI element you need to look into right where your chat minimizes this, get started also comes in. So anyway, so I did that and I started working on it. So I'm looking into it, I'm playing with it to understand what kind of questions it has answers, how much is the accuracy and things like that? So I'm looking into those things straight off the bat. Some of the things are working. Some of the things are not working. So I'm trying to see if it's something I need to do differently or some things like that. But I was doing this last week also. And then I closed it. I moved on to something else. And then once I come back, I don't see anything like this. So I had to do this whole add the data, add the context and start from scratch again. So my very first question is how do we save? If I have to like stop on dresna right now. How do I save? Whatever I have done till now in terms of like data and context and everything?
Benjamin P: Yeah. So that context there does get saved your chat. So the AI chat on the bottom right corner that is per session. So if you are chatting in?
Amrit: The session mode, I'm not looking into the chat but let's say if I go into a new Domo page, right? So I start now. So if I have to go and find that data set. How do I do that?
Benjamin P: Yep. So just get a more, right there and then go to data.
Amrit: Okay.
Benjamin P: And then it will be one of those data sets there. So it looks like you've uploaded that twice already?
Amrit: Exactly.
Benjamin P: Yeah. If you Qlik on one of those, one of those is the one that you had open on the other tab. So what… was the name of the data set?
Amrit: So I think it will be this one.
Benjamin P: Yep. And then if you go to AI readiness at the top?
Amrit: Okay.
Benjamin P: You can see that everything is still there.
Amrit: Perfect. So this answers my first question. So great. Thanks. If I go back… rating sample AI readiness column represents, okay, perfect. Great. Thanks. So I will go ahead and clean some of the ones which got multiple times uploaded. Then the… next question is on the data structure Benjamin. So typically we can use chatbot for two different scenarios. Our use case is two different scenarios. One is purely metric based questions, and another is more like deep diving into text data. So when we are preparing the data to be integrated into the Domo platform, whether through a file as of today, whether through bigquery tomorrow, is there any specific data structure you want us to follow? So that it's easy for the AI model or context to pick… it up. For example, if I show you my file. I think I'll have to start sharing my screen again because share screen. You're able to see an excel file? Benjamin? Yeah. So this is with respect to one of the metric question I was telling you. So in this case, I have adopted a long format data structure where basically each row represent a category or a timeframe, and what metric. It is the reason why I'm doing this is because when we were doing a testing at our end for some of our internal tools, this approach works better for like if you're asking questions related to metric to a chatbot, because then they can use this as a filter in their queries and stuff like that and easily pull the data they want to show us. So, is there any specific format that, which we should stick to when we are trying to prepare our data set for Domo, because ultimately preparing the data set is something which will be our responsibility, right? Because we are deciding what's the math, we are deciding what's the logic. So that's why this question?
Benjamin P: Yep. So looking at the data set there in that excel file that you showed me that looks like a it's already been formatted in a way that's pretty optimal for the queries that you're trying to perform when going forward.

Kunal S: Sorry, what?
William W: I said as good as you can be for a Monday, okay?
Kunal S: For me Tuesday already started?
William W: Oh, lucky Guy… but that also means it's incredibly late where you're at isn't it?
Kunal S: Yes, yes, yes, almost, I believe 12 hours.
William W: Holy smokes, what a beast.
Nik K: Oh, man.
William W: Mr. Fui, mr. Nick morning, gentlemen, or I guess afternoon now?
Fui K: Hello? How's it going? Happy Monday?
William W: Yeah. Nick, they showed us your sidekick app earlier, and that thing is very clean. The UI looks fantastic on it.
Nik K: Yeah, we actually had the design team come in. It was meant to be presented on the dome of palooza stage or one of the working sessions rather. So we had the UI team come in and propose some ideas because mine was nowhere near that clean.
William W: It looked great man.
Juliana J: I'll give them another minute or two before I send them an email. Normally, they're right on time. So, I'm sure they got stuck with something right now?
William W: Hopefully, no emergencies on the floor?
Juliana J: Yep.
Nik K: So, Julianna, actually, I, are we going to cover well, skills matrix? And the UI, is there any piece of the ETL, work for manningapp that we need to cover any pieces that would be relevant for Kunal?
Juliana J: That's a great question. Kunal? Do you have any questions for them as you're working through?
Kunal S: So, Nick, shall we go through the ones that we have discussed in the call?
Nik K: Today… I think at this stage, if you have any questions, yes, but I think right now you've built out the first starting layer, right? So.
Kunal S: Yep. For now, I believe like maybe we do even for the more development and then we can, I believe like we'll have some questions, but for today, it should be fine.
Nik K: Okay. You know, so, I think in that case, if there's no immediate questions for them, then like up to, you can stay if you want out of curiosity, right? For the other projects like, and just with the way the UI is going to look.
William W: I.
Nik K: know it's late, so, just giving you the option.
William W: We might all get to go home early today?
Juliana J: I am shooting them an email right now. Thank you. Fui, I don't know if you have either of their cell phone numbers, but.
Fui K: Double check. Okay. Another one, we transitioned from the new logo team. I know first sync had it, but, yeah, I'll double check and if I do, I'll shoot them a text and let you know.
Juliana J: Okay. Yeah, I'm just thinking in the next few minutes that they don't see my email?
William W: Okay.
Nik K: In the meantime, actually, I think will it'll be good for you just to get an overview of what Kunal's been working on that?
William W: Would be great.
Nik K: Yeah, Kunal, do you just want to like pull up your screen and show them what you have so far and where you're going to go next? Just so, yeah, timeline wise, and, you know, yeah.
Kunal S: So, is it visible? Yes. So will we are just going through the same job and the same part like which was shared earlier. So if you just look into this F5 and five eight, one. So for the job, for this job, and when we look into the packet name as a sleeves that we were looking earlier as well. So for this one, if you see like I've just selected one lot and then I have this part number. So basically, this part number is nothing but the assembly. So for each assembly, as it was mentioned, it can have multiple dependent assemblies as well. So basically like just consider it as a part, it can have multiple other parts also. So based on like I remember like it was mentioned that if it is zero, then this is going to be the top part which should not be test. But in case, like if there is any other part, like for example, this, and okay. So, for this example where we have assembly sequence number, anything apart from zero. So over here, like we have multiple other dependencies. So just wanted to check like how do we flag this then? Going ahead?
William W: Wow, great job.
Nik K: Okay. And then, you know, you have your op number to go by order quantity and you'll get the hours in. So the piece about the flagging, is that a question, Kunal, of how to determine or you're still exploring the dependency?
Kunal S: I'm exploring Nick, because this is currently more or less like from the data that they already have. But I see like we need to tweak in a little bit because there are some things like which can be like which should be changed. So maybe like in the next call when we are completely ready from our side, then maybe we can get into that discussion. But for the initial draft like this is more or less like covering all the fields that is required for us. So what I have done is like I have abstracted like only. So basically, now we only have the relevant fields along with the dependencies. So we just need to find out a logic, how to like find out the critical path, like which dependent task or the part to be preferred. So that is like in progress.
Nik K: Okay. Yeah. So a lot of the groundwork is done. I guess, well, right? I think the next piece hopefully in a few days or towards the end of the week, we'll start having this in and with the full tree mapped out and the order of operations. So.
Kunal S: Yes, and just one thing. So do we have this call only weekly basis? If suppose like we need some inputs mid of the week or like by the end of the week? So how are we going to approach? And like how are we going to get?
Nik K: So we can always do email questions or we can set up separate working sessions for this. This is just recurring sort of overall meeting. But if you want to do separate sessions for just the data part, we can do that mid week also.

Spencer M: That's right? So you?
Jake W: Guys are way hotter than us.
Spencer M: Yeah, it's starting to cool down, but it's slowly coming down.
Jake W: Yeah. We were almost 100 yesterday, so I was like, oh, that's brutal like you're out in the evening and it's still like almost 90 when you're trying to be outside for a little bit, you know, what that's like?
Spencer M: No fun.
Jake W: Are you expecting anybody else from your side joining?
Spencer M: This will probably be bite and be it for us, someone might pop in but I don't think we have to wait.
Jake W: Okay, great. Just as far as like what I kind of had on my list is, you know, well, first of all, just hope, you know, if there's any interest in doing any of our connections tour, I can get you the dates over there to see, you know, I know that most of you work remote and so you could look to see if there's areas that you may want to join. And then the other thing, is just seeing if you've had a chance to kind of think on the adoption engine team, you know, and, you know, how to maybe engage with them. I know that there was like a meeting of just generally kind of sharing your use case and how that works, but would love to get any feedback on those two items, you know, the connection tour and then also how we can, you know, kind of approach the support that Domo's offering.
Spencer M: Yeah. So as far as the connections tours, I and I got some of the promotional material for it and I didn't really see any that was going to be super close but I also didn't have like the largest of interest in showing or doing working on that, but I appreciate you bringing it up. And then as far as the adoption engine, yeah, we met with Jenna Scott and Ivan and I saw you kind of dropped it towards the end there. But I think after talking with Kyle and Brian, some of the direction we do have some direction we want to go with that team. And some of it does revolve around the fact that since Jim's no longer with us, we want to have some options for outlining where we can take Domo within our organization and how we want to have like a bi strategy going forward. So working with them to kind of framework that idea. So we have some abilities to say, what would it look like if we moved more towards like a self service model? Do we still want to funnel all the work up through it and just kind of get a better understanding of where we can go with a rollout and our evolution as far as governance goes. And then as they get a better feel for what we're doing kind of uncovers maybe one or two other things that might be able to guide us and direct us in. But I do think we found some good workflows to start on.
Jake W: Okay. Yeah, that's great. And then just like I guess another note, I know that you guys have like a consulting firm that's you know, going through AI and those sort of things. And so we do have like a couple things that are coming out. And so if it ever makes sense, we could schedule a call with one of our technical resources and they could go through just, you know, they're not released yet, but I think there's some interesting things, you know, we have like we're an app generator that helps people create apps, you know, basically using natural language to then help actually tailor a better prompt to then be able to create an app and you're able to select the data sets. So, you know, I know everybody's on like a different journey for AI, but if that becomes of interest, we could schedule a call and just kind of go over how we're like continuing to think about AI and, you know, some of the things that are coming down our roadmap?
Spencer M: Sure. Yeah, we'll definitely keep it in mind. I know the one thing that I put off last month for us and I've put off twice now is that you sent over the times from where we can meet with the technical resource to review mongodb. I talked with Kyle yesterday and it seems like that's still a path that our, one of our teams is going through. And so I think we're definitely ready to finally have that meeting and that's like the third time I've told you this, but we weren't sure if they were going to commit to it or not. And so we kind of waited until we had more information and it seems like something that we're ready to do. So if you want to send over the times for that technical resource again on Mongo. And then I'll definitely, I'll respond and let you know what we're able to do.
Jake W: Yeah, absolutely. I'll try to get times more for the next week because my technical resource is going to be in Brazil the following week at the data brights Brazil. So I know it may seem a little like quick but that's the block. And then if those times don't work, then we'll just have to kind of skip that next week and then shoot over times.
Spencer M: Okay. That works for us. Anything else that you had for us, Jake?
Jake W: No, I think those were the main things. The connection tour. You know, we're excited with the adoption engine and then, yeah, I think it's great that you're in a spot to kind of review how we can work with your mongodb and kind of go over some best practices there. So I'll get those dates sent over.
Spencer M: Okay. Kyle, anything from you?
Jake W: Not really. No. I think you covered it all.
Spencer M: Sure. And Brian, anything. Nope. I don't have anything. Okay. Yeah, I think that's I guess it sounds like all that we kind of had for the topics today, Jake.
Jake W: Yeah, no, that sounds great. And I'll get these times over really appreciate the time. Thanks everyone.

So that's where I'm finding a lot of the accounts that I work with are kind of excited to work with me, but I am here to kind of help you guys with whatever you need between those things and anything else you may want. So, very excited to be here and work with you guys.
David B: Good deal. Nice to meet you.
Juliana J: Yeah. So will be joining all of our calls going forward and just complimenting our team here. So as you'll see, he's new to Jomo, but definitely has a lot of knowledge. So. Yeah, awesome. I know we've only got about 25 minutes. So if you guys don't mind, we can jump right in. I did send over kind of a brief agenda. Really, we wanted to cover the roadmap, see if you guys had any feedback. I know that Dave, you had met with the C suite and kind of gone over some of those use cases with them. So, yeah, we were, we just wanted to see kind of what that feedback was, see if there's anything we can do to prioritize any of those use cases or anything. We should take off things like that. So with that being said, I'll toss it over to you Dave.
David B: Yeah, overall, I think everybody was pretty excited about what we put forward. You know, we kind of walked them through what's available where we wanted to focus with let's, you know, kind of review through our data sets first and just see if there's anything better we can do cleaning them up, getting them labeled. You know, a lot of people have been starting to play around with the AI chatbot, we're like maybe that'll help make that a little informative because it's been learning as we go and a lot of folks are just like, why doesn't it know this? Oh, we haven't taught it that yet. I think there was quite a bit of interest, you know, especially the rest of this year. Like we're talking to focus in on what it's doing for our demand planning as well as our production forecasting. And if we can get into the PL things great. You know, we did preface a little bit that and we talked about this last time. We know our credit uses is going to be pretty low this year due to the projects we have with moving some of our data sets. So everyone kind of knows, hey, what we tackle this year might be limited once we kind of scope what we can get done within the credit budget we have. But, you know, I think everybody was okay with, hey, some of these things might come later next year into, you know, April once we kind of reset that the sales side of it is exciting. We'll just on that one, you know, a lot of our sales come from retail. So we've got some dashboards up for people to look at. Our wholesale team has kind of been scaled back a little bit with the industry we work on. But I think that'll be something we want to get into tackling at some point right now. We're just like, hey, can you guys hit a goal? Once we can prove the markets that are left that are like, hey, we're regularly doing that, we'll push it forward because our sales rep, visibility and what we have and what we report right now just isn't great. But that's one of those things we've always wanted to get to right now. If you look at our data sets, it's going to say who picked the order, not, who sold it? And that's never very useful.
William W: Amazing. Awesome.
David B: But I think, yeah, we'd start, you tell me where we want to start with in there, but I assumed it all kind of started with data set cleanup. And just to note, I think Joe, we have gotten everything kind of cut over now off of Pennsylvania, right? I was talking to Miles earlier. The data platform was going to shut down here soon.
Joseph L: Correct. Yeah. Everything. The only thing still running off data platform is dimension analysis. This was like 30 days before that shut off there, but everything else has been toggled over.
David B: Good deal.
Juliana J: Okay. Yeah. I'm gonna bring up. Sorry. I'm just writing down. I don't think we had noted on here like AI readiness. I know you just mentioned wanting to make sure like your chatbot works. So you would need to do the AI readiness on some of those data sets and stuff, right? So I'm just adding that on here really quick to take note. So I guess like taking this step back and let me share my screen. Okay. We want to understand some of like the key events that are happening. Maybe the demo can support where we can help maybe automate processes, things like that. We did go and find some things that were like public information. These are just like kind of examples of things that are useful to know.

Brian F: Virginia.
Virginia C: how's it going?
Brian F: Good. Are you in the office?
Virginia C: I am Tuesday Thursdays?
Brian F: Oh boy.
Virginia C: Fun… time. Let's open up the dashboard. Okay. And your email, let me open that up too.
Brian F: Yeah. There's a bit of back and forth there, huh.
Virginia C: Ugh. You're just so difficult.
Brian F: That's what I've been told.
Virginia C: Makes sense. Okay? So, you said we'll take a look at images? Okay? I think that's we'll put that at the bottom of the list because I think that's less important X isn't showing up in the customer profile list. I don't know what that means.
Brian F: So, let me share here. If we go to the settings here on sprout… and this might have been, I made an assumption which as I know is bad, but I was looking for it in here and, I think what I did is I saw tiktok and read X.
Virginia C: I.
Brian F: think that's I think that's what I did.
Virginia C: That's okay. Because I see it there where your mouse is… selected down. Yeah, right there. See, I see that, but I don't you're right? I don't see it in the customer profiles, which is weird.
Brian F: So, now that I'm looking at this, it even more that's exactly what I did because I don't have any tiktok metrics selected. So, okay. So, yes. So X isn't in this list?
Virginia C: And that's probably because they recently changed their user agreement, data handling, which is… disappointing, but we should be able to pull direct from channel, right? And how does that fold into this?
Brian F: So, I… looked into that too. Well, first of all… your meetings this afternoon, is that right? So I'm a little unless… you're going to tell me like tiktok is very important to get up and running. I'm not going to touch this and let's touch it, talk about it later. Okay? Otherwise, I'm going to try to add in those metrics now.
Virginia C: Okay.
Brian F: But if it's not that big of a deal and you can talk around it at least for now, then we're good. Yep. I.
Virginia C: would say for today, it's fine. It's a consideration for the broader application.
Brian F: Yeah, it's here and it's just a matter of bringing it in and making sure we get everything. So, I'm not worried about that at all. Like, I think it'll be easy to add.
Virginia C: Okay.
Brian F: X is a little different. I, it's… like the, so I saw that you were playing around with this stuff.
Virginia C: Hold on. I, when somebody left, they transferred all of their data to like data ownership to me. I was not playing.
Brian F: Okay. So, somebody was playing around with getting the data in. Looks like, is it's because of this error? So, this works like it actually ran yesterday. Look at turning that off. Actually, this is the one I started playing with a little bit. So, this was back in December 20 23. See how far back it was and it says you don't have access to everything. I'm like, okay, well, you know, let me just change it. And today, I got pretty much the same error.
Virginia C: Okay.
Brian F: And the other thing is that this connector, Doesn't exist, in demo anymore. And so, yeah, what you said with, the data, you know, they're changing things over there. Did I search for? I did. Oh, there it was… this is the only one that's coming up now for them. This is X ads connector, so we could get, if we can get paid information. What I'm not seeing is a way to get, organic.
Virginia C: Organic got it.
Brian F: From them right now.
Virginia C: Last run never, I'm just opening up all these that's followers. So, I've got raw Twitter account, raw, Twitter, home timeline. I don't know what that means followers, and just generally Twitter, this data set has been activated, deactivated. It won't update or run automatically. It's update set, yep, manually.
Brian F: Actually, so, one thing that it actually, is, documented if you Qlik, the question mark here, it goes through like here's, what's provided from these, the different reports. So, the one we want the user timeline.
Virginia C: Okay.
Brian F: Right. I tried to go back 60 days. I mean, I don't think it has anything to do with that. It's just saying that you don't have access to the endpoint?
Virginia C: Limited… example media post or oauth, only if you need access to the endpoint, you may need a different access level. You can learn more here. Copy, put it in the chat so we can read it together. Access filtered stream API, ready to build on. X. Okay. You have to pay for the API access.
Brian F: I don't want to sign into Twitter, you imbecile.
Virginia C: Well, here, I'm signed in. So here, let's do it, send request?
Brian F: Oh, all right. Let's stop share. Try again. Sorry.
Virginia C: Number three share. When you Qlik that link, and if you're signed in, this is what you get. You've got basic unlock to X version two apis, right? 3,000 posts per month or you can sign up for pro. This is wild… you have to pay, you have to pay you.
Brian F: Pay 100 dollars and you save 100 dollars, if you pay it all at once, you'll save 300 dollars versus monthly. I mean… good for them.
Virginia C: Get that dollar, but also, it sucks for us.
Brian F: Well,
Virginia C: but that answers our question, right? It 100… percent answers the question. Okay. So, Twitter's a no go, tiktok, it's not a priority for us. So, we'll table that… I'm okay. If we delete my wireframe, are you okay if I delete the wireframe?
Brian F: Yeah.
Virginia C: Okay. And I'll not touch any of that. Let's see back to your email here's. A field with hashtags in it. This feels like a dr seuss book here's. An example. HH. Okay. So… eventually, I think hashtags and understanding the performance… I don't know that it matters in this application because we're not attributing the impressions and engagements exclusively to that hashtag. There's no filtering down to say which hashtag made the biggest difference?
Brian F: Right. But your email was like, you want to be able to get to certain tags?
Virginia C: So, I'll show you what I meant by that in sprout… doo. In sprout when I go and make a post, I can use a sprout tag… to label things as certain things.

Justin Z: That's impressive. I.
Katie O: know we're getting there, man. You're gonna get there too. So quick update, yes, mark will probably drop as soon as I say this, but we had an email exchange about it this morning. So, Nick's actually out of office today, so he was wanting to see if we could move this call to Wednesday instead so that he could be here to kind of go over some updates with you. Yeah. Is that okay? Of course, but before we hang it all up, I did want to talk about the sso issue with you.

Katie O: I'm gonna make it an hour. And then if we don't need 30, we'll just cut it and everybody will be happy.

Katie O: Because I need to check with him, I don't know like how long I have a feeling he'll only need 30.
Justin Z: Yep. Okay. But so, okay. So, block the hour. And then if he's like no thirty's plenty. He'll shorten it. How's my boy meekum, doing? Is he gonna join one of these?
Katie O: I don't know if he's gonna join one of these because he is a busy little bee.
Justin Z: He is a busy little.
Katie O: Bee, he doesn't talk to me anymore. He's gotten too big for his britches. And I'm a little hurt about it. If we're just being honest, I thought I was special to him. Yeah, but I'm nothing now. I understand. He's my boss's boss… how quickly I've fallen?
Justin Z: How quickly he's risen is really the thing right?
Katie O: Yeah, yeah, yeah. I don't if he can join one of them. I'll see if he's available. I always kind of like include him and then he usually is like, I can't I'm like the four times booked and I'm like get it. You're a man who's important.
Justin Z: Yep. And listen, we can keep him off for a little bit.
Katie O: But maybe we'll start keeping him involved on like email conversations. He's aware of everything going on. It's just making it the call is really hard for him right now.
Justin Z: I understand especially given the frequency with which we have them. So, yeah. All right. So let's do Wednesday without him and then we'll figure it out after that, depending on how the update goes.
Katie O: Well, let him know that, you do miss his pretty face and that you want to see him.

Justin Z: That's right? And he, and, he can call me anytime he wants, oh.
Katie O: He knows that, yeah, yeah, yeah, he knows that. All right. So let's talk about the elephant in the room, the sso interview, yes, please. So you want me to just kind of relay what was in the email and kind of start that off?
Justin Z: Yeah. So, so give me the non corporate speak, disclaimed version, of this, like what actually happened? Was it just fidel? Was, I assume it was everybody? Like all your clients, but I have no idea. So just get, so just sort of tell me, what happened there? Yeah.
Katie O: So, we, as, you know, do product enhancements and updates and releases. And when we did one of those enhancements, and I think it said it in the email, people who had their sso configured in a particular way, were impacted by this because y'all did not have, the… functionality switched over to not… automatically create new users. So when they updated this, it switched that back over right back to original settings. And then anybody who was, originally configured to just kind of where they're already still an sso member of your organization. So it wouldn't have gone out to like somebody who's left the organization. Yeah, it set them up as a user. As soon as we realized what happened, we went ahead, deleted them. As users went ahead, took care of the correction of it. We don't it's not enabled on your account anymore. And it's interesting because I had this for one account and the account technically is like divided, right? Like there's a us version of the account. And then there's global side of the account and the us side did not have it configured properly. Their sso, they didn't have it configured the same way as global. So, one was hit one was not on this. And when I say hit, I just mean impacted, right?
Justin Z: Yeah.
Katie O: So, it was just a snappoo with the enhancement. And then we went and got it corrected for y'all but we just have to communicate that to you since it was users to your account.
Justin Z: Can you?
Katie O: Imagine if we didn't that'd be so terrible.
Justin Z: Yeah, a 1,000,000 percent. Yeah. So obviously, it's… good that you guys caught it. It's good that you communicated it, right? All good things. It leaves me wondering sort of, should I be going back to our favorite old school observability conversations? Is this something that I have to be like, anytime you have one of these snappoos, any vendor, anywhere, whatever, right? It's just like, oh, we thought we were secure, never would have expected this one, right? Everything's configured, right? It's a one and done. So, how would we even monitor for this? Should we monitor for this? I would say we have to monitor for this because it happened, right?

Hey.
Shane W: How's it going?
Jesse M: Good. Thanks for teams.
Shane W: Yeah, we got that going for you. Let's see. I was talking to some people about the sso issue and I was wondering and they were wondering, is there a way that we could maybe, and maybe we did this? I just don't know but I want to do like a screen recording of it so I can kind of show them like exactly where the problem's at because I was explaining it to them and I don't know that I explained it in a way that was clear for them. So if we could record, that would be amazing. Awesome. Oh, and I don't know if you saw I submitted the request to get your instance name changed. And so they're in the process of doing that, there was some, this would have been sooner, but I was, I had to work through some issues to get it done. So they're working… on it. So that should, and I said don't do it until we are with Jesse and we can make sure that we're doing it at the right time and it's everything's going to be okay with sso. So we have the pieces in place.
Jesse M: Cool. It sounds good. Yeah. Let me, let me know and then I can start trying to schedule… the time with you guys and the sso team at Gallagher and then they'll be able to share their screens and let you see how they're setting it up and everything else.
Shane W: Okay. Yeah, that, yeah, that probably… I guess I can see all that. But yeah, if you could just walk through an example, then I can kind of share it. And then we can go from there. And I, you know, you also said it's on your mobile app as well, right? The issue?
Jesse M: Well, it's yeah, here, it has to do with. Yes. So right now, we have mixed login mode turned on, okay? Which, which means you can still log in with your username and password… when… let me find. Any email from Domo, right? So if… I'm logged out right now, right? So if I come and say whatever you alert, or anything, it'll take me to that same mixed mode login screen. Yeah. And, and there isn't a button on here for SSL. And, we figured some of this out when we talked before. So how the users log in now is, they Qlik this thing which takes them through ping?
Shane W: Got it.
Jesse M: And so that's the only way sso is set up right now with this stuff. So.
Shane W: And, and we have the mixed mode because you have some people who don't have sso logins, right? Yeah.
Jesse M: Yeah, but I think we can… I think we can get around that. I'm missing something here. What am I missing?
Shane W: What are you trying to get to?
Jesse M: This is… this is not the saml, sso, it's like it's not there anymore. There used to be more options, maybe it moved.
Shane W: I think that single sign on the saml one is below the oidc… type. So, if you, I think maybe go down and Qlik on the three.
Jesse M: Oh, oh, here we go.
Shane W: Yeah, they may have changed that this.
Jesse M: Is all this is all new? Okay?
Shane W: Yeah.
Jesse M: All right. So. Thank you. Now, the mixed mode button is somewhere else also.
Shane W: Yeah.
Jesse M: All right. Well, it looks like it got renamed to kind of this, maybe, yeah. So…… if we had turned that off in the past, right? Then then it lets us let the users who still need to log in, be set up on the direct sign in list. Yeah. And with the configuration, we should just be able to say. Well, I guess we'd have to try both of these and see.
Shane W: Which one you like?
Jesse M: And see which, yeah, see which one works best, both for outside users and.
Shane W: And then,
Jesse M: the internal sso users.
Shane W: Let me see if I can find it. One thing that I've used like as a like… for logging into instances that don't have like a like where I can put my username and email in, let me see if I can find this. There is a, what we call like, a hook. So, if you, I mean, I'll put this in the chat… and I guess, this is like more one off type thing. It's not going to be. If, if you have a lot of people doing it, then, it doesn't but if you have like consultants or somebody who needs to log into your instance, occasionally, this might be a good way of having everything be in the sso. And then those people who are on the direct sign on list can still log in and so I just put it in there. So, if you go to your instance, and then you put a slash and you put that auth demo manual login at the very end, Then that will take you to a login screen even if everything is on the sso as set up. Yeah, or you could use that Easter egg.
Jesse M: Okay. So here's the error we wanted to see.
Shane W: Okay.
Jesse M: So, this is what happened when we turned off mixed mode login last time and I just did it again.
Shane W: Okay, perfect.
Jesse M: And so the sso isn't set up where we can just Qlik the sign on with sso button. When you come to, that… screen.
Shane W: What happens if we do the other one, the direct one?
Jesse M: Okay. Same here. So that's the piece and I think that's on our side. I think the guys configuring it just missed something that would enable this to work this way.
Shane W: Yeah. Let me, let me ask. I'll ask around about that, like what is the best… way if they've seen that issue before and maybe there's a pretty common fix. Okay, perfect. I'm glad we have that. So this is, I'll share that and we'll be able to figure out what's going on.
Jesse M: Outside of that, I've got it on my list to kind of get in touch with Patrick who's who works with Sam. Okay? And, and… he was the one that would probably start playing around with some workbench stuff. And actually, I thought of a use case for that too. The other day. I've got, a user activity report for Power BI users that gets updated manually every week. And so I thought I could use, I thought I could build a workflow to have it schedule the report after the data set was updated.
Shane W: Oh, yeah, totally. Yeah.

Joe P: Hey, Carl, how's it going?
Karl A: Okay. And yourself?
Joe P: Yeah, it's going pretty well. It's going pretty well. Thank you.
Karl A: I can hear my cat meowing next door?
Joe P: He wants?
Karl A: Food or something. I don't know.
Joe P: Hungry need some food out.
Karl A: I can never tell. I mean, who else would have cat meowed?
Joe P: Yeah, that's true unless it found something interesting. Wow, that thing is huge.
Karl A: That is.
Joe P: A big cat?
Karl A: A bird?
Joe P: Yeah, just a ton of fluff.
Karl A: But she's a big cat. So, she's a ragdoll and ragdolls are large cats.
Joe P: Yeah. Have you brought her? Has she traveled all around the world with you? Was she in Singapore? And then here, and I guess how old is she? Is the question?
Karl A: Yeah. So, she was with us in Singapore. She is, I think three and a half years old.
Joe P: Okay.
Karl A: Getting on. Isn't that right?
Joe P: Carl, yeah.
Karl A: I'm going to put you back outside. Now. Put me out. Good to go.
Joe P: I like cats. You know, they're like super cute and fluffy and then they're actually little killing machines, which I think I find fascinating. They're like maybe the most efficient killing machines on earth, close to, so interesting. I think it's funny. I think just how adorable they are. And then you put them in front of some prey and they have like the fastest reflexes and they can pretty much shred anything to pieces. I think it's I think it's an interesting little juxtaposition.
Karl A: Yeah. And, and, I also understand that, we didn't really domesticate cats. It's like cats sort of came to us and domesticated us.
Joe P: Yeah, it was Egypt, right? I think is, when that, that's that relationship started there. And, and then, we became their, they're now our owners.
Karl A: Yeah. Do you have cats yourself?
Joe P: We did, we had them for a few years. Our last one died. We had to be put to sleep about a year ago. And, and, I'm kind of done with them for a while. So, I have an animal free house right now, much to my children's dismay. But yeah, after having them for about 18 years, I was like, I'm ready to be 18 years.
Karl A: That is an old cat.
Joe P: Yeah, and, we had a couple more in there too, and one of them was unfortunately, like really attached to my daughter from the day my daughter was born. And the day we brought her home from the hospital, this cat, had a total attachment to my daughter like, would stand guard, would stand guard over her, if she was. And, so that was a tough one when she lost her. And that was a, that was like a couple years ago when she was, when she was 12, but yeah, we had a, we had a cat go to 18 years old, so.
Karl A: Yeah, I'm not sure how old ours will live. I don't think ragdolls live that long, unfortunately.
Joe P: No, that's sad.
Karl A: Like 13 years. They have like bad kidney problems.
Joe P: Oh, okay. Okay. Yeah, it's, that was tough. I wasn't an animal person, to be honest with you. I didn't have any growing up, but, you know, I got really attached to this cat, and then putting it down was extremely difficult. So, and I let it live a little bit longer than I should have too. Cuz I didn't wanna go through it. So, poor cat like didn't have a great quality of life, for a couple months, but I was like, oh, I can't do it yet. I'm ready.
Karl A: So, so, you know, that is a sad story.
Joe P: I know, yeah, on to happier things. I think Mike has a conflict, so he might be, if he's able to join, he's gonna be about 15 minutes late, possibly, but he wasn't sure if he was able to join, at all. He didn't really pass along an agenda though. What did we wanna? What did we wanna cover today?
Karl A: Three things I wanna talk about. This might actually be quite quick. So, number one is that, you know, we were, I was doing a review of some of the stuff and some of the objects and the content in the instance with Dale and he's somewhat expressed a bit of a frustration around like naming conventions is a big one where people aren't following it. And, and even like where we have data flows that are running that perhaps shouldn't be, or data flows that should be, dataset views instead.
Joe P: Yeah.
Karl A: So, is there anything like I'm gonna build something out? I'm gonna do it with, with, God, I've forgotten his name. Don't tell him. I forgot his name?
Joe P: Shane.
Karl A: No, not with Shane, although I could see some value in getting him involved. Wait a minute. Did I not? Oh, my gosh. I didn't, I didn't send out. He's got a mental block. Yeah, there we go, Brendan. Yeah, I'm gonna do with Brendan.
Joe P: Oh, okay. Okay.
Karl A: But just because… he's one of the, criminals actually,
Joe P: So,
Karl A: so,
Joe P: he got himself a job.
Karl A: Yeah. Well, that's right. I mean, look, you know, I think this is a good opportunity that I can, impart some knowledge into him and perhaps not come across as too condescending. If we do this collaboratively.
Joe P: Okay. Yeah, that makes sense.
Karl A: But that said, if you guys have anything we can use to start with, that would be great. You know, I think like, you know, it goes back to, you know, wanting to get Andrea into, to do a course to do a training thing, right? I haven't contacted her yet, but I know she had training materials lying around and this is one chart. So, there's one slide I'm thinking of and it's got like all of the different options and when you would use them for transforming data, so that sort of thing would be very handy in this particular case.
Joe P: All right. I am trying to make a note here. So, but my onenote isn't cooperating. Give me just a second. Let me try it one more time. No worries. Otherwise, I'm going to go to the old sticky notes. Yeah, it's almost like my outlook is disconnected from my onenote. Let me, let me try this manually here, uripg calls. So, you mentioned, you mentioned using certain transformation tools in certain situations. But then also, something about naming conventions, is that something that you have to, that you would need to standardize internally? Yeah.
Karl A: I guess so, I mean, honestly, I'm not really too fussed about naming conventions.

Morning, apu. Morning, morning, Michael… morning, Alex. Good morning.
Scott T: Good morning. How are we doing today?
Michael T: Good morning, Scott. Good. How are you?
Scott T: Doing all right… good. I feel like it's been a long time since we talked Michael. Good morning. How are the new data sets coming along? Any issues?
Michael T: Not so… much. We completely abandoned the idea of using C data for the old deployment… which you know, honestly is what we should have done to begin with. And I believe we got everything uploaded for that. And then the data, we uploaded a bunch of tables for the new ones. So, for the sake of today, like we have quite a bit of data to work with. But now I'm just working on all the red tape and background stuff, get vendor onboarding and stuff with the C data team so we can purchase the license. I'm sure it's not pulling live data at this point until we pay up, so to speak. But obviously we'll finish that up and get that going. But the data is still in there ready to be worked with.
Scott T: Great. It's like Jenna's joining Jenna. I think I just saw a note from Ivan saying he was going to miss the first half of this call. I think it was this call. Yeah. Okay. So I don't think there's anyone else from Domo's side that we're waiting for? I don't believe. So. Is there anyone from kronos' group that we're.
Michael T: waiting in?
Mat W: I think just John and… puan, okay, they both are on and rob's on. Yeah, I think we're all here.
Scott T: Awesome.
Mat W: So, I think, yeah, maybe, you know, I know that the group, Mike, you just kind of gave a quick summary. But just, what have we gotten up? What have we gotten uploaded? All of the BC tables are refreshing. Now, are they coming in like regularly like on a like, are they pulling regularly or is it just one and what tables do we have uploaded for BC?
Michael T: Right now, so from BC, we have a lot of tables uploaded, but no, they're not going to be pulling regularly until we finish onboarding cdata and purchasing it. So obviously they were working live for the third day trial. So we have that information from basically a little over a week ago and then, and that's what we can work with. For now. We can even build the tables with it. They just won't reflect live data until, we have that license.
Mat W: Okay. All right. And what quickly? What do we need to do to get that license from cdata?
Michael T: I'm just waiting for them to get back, with all the documents that we need signed for chronos group. Okay? And then we can, then we can purchase it. So it's the normal onboarding process. Yeah. And the, you know, the most painful part, getting them to sign that six page document?
Mat W: Yep. Yeah, I understand. Okay. All right. But at least it gives us something to start with or at least look at the data, right? And like, I think, you know, Scott and, you know, if you could, that gives you an idea of what the data is going to look like, you know, going forward. And then I saw a note from John last week that like you guys were able to upload the historical data as well?
Michael T: Yeah. So all that historical data is in there now, and obviously that's static. So that's the data that we're working with now and in the future?
Mat W: Okay. All right. That's good. Yeah, I don't know like Scott, Jenna, like, what would you suggest, you know, is the best use of our time for today? Like do we, I know this is kind of like, do we talk about, you know, what, what's best to do like with the data? Now? Do we, you know, do we try to, do we talk about what other things we're trying to work on in parallel? Like, you know, up to you?
Scott T: Yeah. So, from my perspective, you know, the other data sources that we're wanting to bring in, right? Is priva, right? And I think that we have a call with moochie, or we can schedule a call with moochie, correct? I apologize. I meant to check on the status of that call, no?
Mat W: The last note I saw, with Sim was you were looking to schedule a call. They were just confirming who on their team was going to be on the call? But I think the last note I saw from Xavier was that call was going to be, well, let me just see what he said.
Scott T: Oh, yeah. We sent over a few times we sent over Thursday, Friday, Wednesday.
Mat W: Correct. Thursday, Friday, Monday, Wednesday. Yeah. And I think you're just waiting to hear back. So, so listen, I think if we, if you don't hear back from him, you know, I think if Ivan doesn't hear back from him by the end of the day, just respond and say, hey, can we find a time, you know, get one of these four times that work for you guys?
Scott T: Yeah, cause that's the other, that's the other large data set, that we're wanting to bring in, right?
Mat W: Correct. And then, the other two, you know, we got notes from, and I'll send a note today, Scott to both the guys that viscon, right? He responded and said, hey include this representative, you know, if you want to talk about an API connection. So, I'm going to respond on behalf of the company and say, hey, can we set up a call to discuss what API connections you guys have available? And how do we connect to it, you know, with Domo? And I'll try to find some times that work for them either later this week, early, you know, early next week and I'll put yourself and is there someone who's the best people on the Domo team to include if we're talking about API connections?
Scott T: Yeah, yeah. Probably myself. And I mean, you could include Alex as well. He's going to be helping me out on this project. So,
Mat W: So, so the two things that matt kind of connected us with were viscon is our kind of, you know, warehouse management, you know, kind of tracking packing software system. So, they track a ton of all of our inventory movement and, you know, quantities and weights, and all that stuff gets tracked in viscon, and, they collect a lot of data. So, so that would be a good one to also kind of bring in to Domo. And then we can decide how we use it when we get it in.

You know, there's the sales process they have recruiting… the recruiter, right? And then I think we switched gears to something else. Yeah. Well, they identified that marketing use case right?

Zachary O: Understood. I mean, that's honestly, when I get a really interesting case, it's one of those head down and.
Jason J: Well, that's the fun. It's a, it's a puzzle for me like, I was just like I finally crashed in and rebuilt it. I had a whole long thing where I was like doing the cool processing stuff where it's like, hey, take out all these, fields because it would speed up the processing and everything. I had this filter in there that was doing exactly the opposite of what I wanted no matter, what I put in it. Like, I did equals, I did not equals and it was still doing the exact same thing. So, I finally deleted that one and rebuilt it from scratch and it seems to be working now cool.
Zachary O: Good to hear. Glad we were able to get you up and spun up and ready to go on everything. Yeah.

Jason J: but here's, the thing, Ben reached out to me yesterday, though, and I told Zach this too, I think, as Ben reached out to me, he was like, hey, how are we doing on the ML, data? I'm like, well, not too good since a whole lot of stuff, like broke in Domo over last week and, Zach and I worked on it yesterday and was looking at it like just some weird configuration changes that broke things. And I had been working on that all week, trying to like get stuff working again. And can't find where these changes came from or what happened? It's just probably some loopy bug, but.
Zachary O: Yeah, I'm, I'm looking into dataflow settings and where we record those in the, like dataflow trigger settings to see where we record those in the audit trail. Cause that's what I got to track down, because it doesn't seem to be, loading in the, the activity log. So that's my job for today.

Phil S: Yeah, and, and Jason, I, yeah, I know I texted you, but, yeah, I'm excited about the I'm trying to get that we're having some of those teams, doing in that trial like the free instance right now in azure, and I want to move that one to GCP because.
Jason J: we.
Phil S: might as well, right? Like, let's not move you to GCP right now.
Jason J: Right again, I mean, it went pretty smooth. I'm not scared of it. We just got to do it at the right timing, make sure like we can revert quickly if it need be just things like that. Yeah. Oh… here's, what I want to ask. Okay. And this may take some like, or, I'm sure it will take some investigating in that. So, there was big email that came out about AI a day or two ago, and I think I vaguely mentioned this a little bit in something I sent you, Phil, or maybe… Zach too, I don't remember, but it's basically that, hey, we're allowed to use copilot and gemini right now. I mean, that's been completely approved.
Phil S: That's awesome.
Jason J: But they want to make sure that like we're logging into gemini, okay? So I can turn gemini on easy enough. But that's going through your guys' stuff. And like, how would I make that gemini model know that it's me using it? That is the key because of course, home depot has their own contracts with Google and they want to make sure it's flowing through our privacy and data security setup that they did with them basically.
Phil S: Yeah. Zach, do you have that admin setting or,
Jason J: I mean.
Zachary O: I know what the admin set, the required grants are for using AI services, but I need to dig in to see, how you give me like five minutes. I'm going to see if I can because.
Jason J: I mean, I turned on gemini versus chatgpt that was in there, but again, it's still there's no place to put credentials there's. It's just on. So it's like, okay, that's going through your guises. Yeah. Is there a way for me to set up a different connection where I'm putting in the credentials or something like that?
Phil S: Yeah, there is.
Zachary O: I'm just checking that right now and.
Jason J: If not, that might be something to look towards because I guarantee you, I'm not going to be the only person on the edge of AI, that, would stumble into this in a company that it's like, oh, well, okay. We're set up with this. We've got to use this.

Nik K: We're.
Mark L: getting a lovely picture of something like your car. Are you driving? Oh,
Katie O: yes, because my Ia doctor appointment ran over and then on the way home in like just karma, I hit the road that I live off of. They've closed it. So, I've had to like go completely around like the interstate to get over to the other side of the interstate.
Mark L: That's wild. That's so.
Katie O: Frustrating, I was like, that is just like, you know, it was tight because the doctor ran over and then I was like, but I'm going to make it, and then I got to this road closed sign and I was like, you've got to be kidding me.
Mark L: That's so frustrating. I,
Katie O: know, what can you do though, you know?
Mark L: Yesterday was first day of school. I was taking my son to.
Katie O: Drink, aww.
Mark L: And driving through neighborhoods, for some reason, a semi truck must have taken like the wrong route and I got stuck behind the semi truck driver, driving through neighborhoods and literally like went like the exact same path we went.
Katie O: No, what?
Mark L: Should have taken like just a few minutes ended up being like 20 minutes. I was like my,
Katie O: goodness.
Mark L: we cannot be late on the first day.
Katie O: Of school. Oh, no, you're going to be late. This is what it is today.
Mark L: Oh, my gosh. It was so funny.
Katie O: It's like when you're running late, and then you hit every red light and every slow driver on the road, it's just like you've got to be kidding me.
Mark L: At that point, it's like, okay, let me just mindset shift. I'm just going to put on some, Bob Marley roll down the.
Katie O: Windows. Yeah, because there's nothing you can do to fix it like there's nothing, it is what?
Mark L: It is, maybe I'll light up a spliff… like, we're going to enjoy this.
Katie O: Yeah, I mean, it's only going to cause you more frustration to get upset about it than it will anything else. So.
Mark L: Exactly. So, we, I think Justin's the man of the hour that we're.
Katie O: waiting on, he, is, we're just waiting on mr Jay Z.
Mark L: And then Nick's going to sprinkle all his magic all over.
Katie O: That's right? Nick, have we discussed like when they're going to clone you? Because that'd be great.
Mark L: Yeah, I.
Nik K: know, I keep telling them you need three of me, so.
Katie O: I mean, to be fair, that is like such a compliment though, like, you know, to your team, like you need three of me, I'm that Guy.
Nik K: Okay. So, yeah, I'm falling behind though. I haven't done all the changes Justin wanted, but I wanted to still give him something and keep the moment. Yeah. So, okay.
Katie O: Yeah. And he did accept. So he will be here.
Mark L: Okay.
Nik K: Katie, for this one, we didn't have a longer term set of projects or use cases identified. No, this.
Katie O: Has been the main project that's been going on and off for about a year and a half. So, this is and a lot of it as, you know, was kind of started and then we've stopped and started. So, just trying to get this one across the finish line.
Nik K: Has he ever mentioned though that once we do this like this might be our next opportunity or something like, are we shooting for something other than an adoption? Okay?
Katie O: Once because the use case at fidelity is their leadership team. Once this project gets completed, what he'll do is he'll take this and find a like a specific use case for it and we might have to tweak it and then he'll take it internally and to be able to show what can be done with it versus what they're currently doing. And from there, maybe in the future, but like that's at least a year out the additional projects that might come up but nothing right now.
Nik K: Okay.
Katie O: Yeah.
Nik K: But in the meantime, they are doing other stuff in Domo, right? Oh.
Katie O: Yeah. Their entire leadership team uses Domo. So.
Nik K: Okay. I was just scared. We're kept at an arm's length, right? So, I don't even know if this was the only thing happening in the way to rescue, but,
Katie O: no, this is not like a rescue… once goals was removed as part of their contract. We've just been trying to find a new area that we can kind of tap in on. Okay? So that's kind of where we sit with it.
Nik K: Okay.
Katie O: Yeah. Well, how was the first day mark… school? Everything go? Okay?
Mark L: Wait, today's, Wednesday. Yeah. So this is Monday. I said yesterday. Oh, okay.
Katie O: Monday?
Mark L: Okay. Wow. We're already on Wednesday the first day.
Katie O: Was that's all right? Last night? I thought to myself. I was like, oh, tomorrow is Thursday. And then I thought.
Mark L: I know this week's gone fast.
Katie O: It's not, it's not.
Mark L: Well, wait, tomorrow is Thursday. Now, tomorrow?
Katie O: Is Thursday now?
Mark L: The first day was a success. Good. They're in a, you know, they're in the rhythm. So, it's good. And it's busy, but yeah, it's good. No complaints, just super busy.
Katie O: Guys, I can't make this up now. I've got somebody driving on a tractor, a barn, I'm on a two Lane country road. I,
Mark L: love it. I,
Katie O: mean, what in the.
Mark L: world? Katie, where do you live?
Katie O: I live outside of, Nashville.
Mark L: Oh, nice. That's awesome. So many people are moving to Nashville area, Tennessee, Nashville.
Katie O: Area. Yeah, tell me about it.
Mark L: One of my, I'm from southern California. One of my old buddies is his son and their family are moving out there, and he's saying that.
Katie O: Of course, they are, he's.
Mark L: likely going to move out there now too.
Katie O: Yeah, they're all moving out here because we don't have state property or income tax. It's just sales tax. And then, yeah.
Mark L: That's similar to like Texas, right? Nevada.
Katie O: Austin and stuff like that. They're all having like a big boom for that exact same reason. And then when probably like 10 years ago, when this whole like migration from California really started, it was that you could leave California and have, you know, a 1,000,000 dollars in equity from a tiny little house in California, and then you could come and pay cash for an 800,000 dollar mcmansion out here.

Dan R: Did.
Scott B: you end up buying that motorcycle?
ShipOffers: You know what? No, I sold steers and I bought myself a sporty suv. Okay. What is it? I did? An SQ five.
Scott B: Oh, cool.
ShipOffers: So, kind of the mid size souped up engine model just because the more I thought about it like the original plan was the motorcycle and then buy this old Q7 that my wife's been driving. My ex wife's been driving. Yeah, and modify that. And the more I thought about it, I'm like, I'm committing to only two hobbies if I do this, like I'll either be riding motorcycles or going off roading and that's it. I said, the way I'm traveling right now and other life choices. I'm just going to get something I really enjoy driving all the time. Yeah. And then do the other stuff. But next year, I don't know, it's still on my radar. Like there's a couple, you know, older BMW adventure bikes that, you know, ride in that three grand range. Yeah, 700 CC enough to get me up the mountain and not, you know, be a complete idiot, but that's probably going to be next year.
Scott B: Those bikes are so fun. My neighbor across the street has one and I ride it every now and then.
ShipOffers: You know, take it on a dirt trail, take it up the interstate and it'll do it both.
Scott B: Yeah, I know.
ShipOffers: Joe used to have some, oh, really, I was an adventure bike, but now he's had a lot of like motorcycles and stuff and BMW specifically, I believe. Yeah.
Scott B: Yeah, they just go forever too.
ShipOffers: That's and that's what I'm thinking. I mean, some of these are even low Miles, you know, 12, 17,000 Miles is all on a 20 year old bike and I'm like,
Scott B: nothing.
ShipOffers: That'll do.
Scott B: Yeah, just change the oil and you'll be good to go. You know?
ShipOffers: That's about the extent of my mechanical ability. So.
Scott B: Yeah, I don't know what?
ShipOffers: I mean, you did your struts, I did, I know, I always don't take off more than I can chew though halfway through the project. I'm like, am I going to die the first time I drive this like boing, do?
Scott B: You have your endorsement?
ShipOffers: No, and that's I keep putting that off. I know I just need to pull the trigger on that. One of my, I have a friend who he's been, he's older. I mean, he's been riding like 50 years. I mean, he taught the classes for like 15 years. And so he's like, you know, we can just go out and do that or you can take class. And so I've been playing back and forth to just going out with him and then just taking the test.
Scott B: Yeah, it's you know, I mean, if you spend a couple Saturdays, you'll be fine. It just isn't that hard. It's just like clutch controls, the biggest deal, being able to be comfortable braking that kind of stuff. I mean.
ShipOffers: I grew up on motorcycles when I was young, I'm sure it'll come back.
Scott B: Oh, yeah. It'll come right back. I got my wife riding probably three weeks ago, oh.
ShipOffers: Really? How's she doing? How's she, liking that? She's.
Scott B: starting to pick it up. She's kind of like, she's the hardest part for her is she's been, she's not great at driving a stick like a clutch. So she's trying to figure that out. And like cars and motorcycles are different because in the sense that motorcycles, you've got this friction zone, like in cars, you don't want to really burn the clutch, but like in motorcycles, it's not even the same, you know? Yeah, like figuring out the friction zone and when to use it and turning, and we have bluetooth helmets. So I ride next to her, you know, on my dirt bike and just, you know, kind of teach her like, okay, follow me, do these lines. But now, I've got her to the point where she wants to buy her own Harley. So, oh.
ShipOffers: His and hers.
Scott B: Yeah, it'll be awesome. It's going to be so fun. Hey, Dan. Hey.
ShipOffers: Hey, everybody. Good to see you.
Scott B: How's it going? Good. Cool. We're not waiting on anybody else, right? This is it from the Domo side?
ShipOffers: Yeah, this is it from our side.
Scott B: Okay. So let me bring you up to speed. We've had tons of conversations back and forth internally. I think we've gotten to the point where we feel pretty comfortable about what we're about to present. We do require some additional feedback from you guys based on kind of what we've been able to capture. So what I'm thinking is I'll present pricing assumptions, that kind of stuff. I've got it all in a document. And then there's some additional collection that we're going to want to do from you guys as far as like end user experience, the app that we want to build. I know that Dan's been doing some work there too. So let me pull this up. This is not a legal document by any means but it is just a way for me to kind of collect everything all together. So table of contents, it's only four or five pages long. This shows kind of the architecture and outline that we put together that we were using internally to help scope. This. It shows the four different communication channels there's, email and there is Google meets, but we're not including that. In this scope. I specifically highlighted that here. So all that's already in Hubspot, but we're not including any of that in this scope that's correct, right? Kiefer, correct? From there. Once we ingest that on a daily cadence is what we're projecting right now that's everything that I've been telling everybody from there, it's kind of two parts. So by ingesting that into the Domo, we've got that in a dataset which Dan will present on what we're thinking there. But as far as the AI summarization, so we're able to collect that. We do a daily summarization. If there's been no communication from that customer that day, nothing new will be written to Hubspot. If there is communication, then we'll create this AI generated recap, and we've got some flexibility around what we want that to look like.

The key differences between the standard and enterprise plans were the cost per credit ($1.25 vs $1) and the execution caps (20 vs 10), which would significantly reduce Maki's credit usage. Maki agreed to review the options with his team and provide a decision, with the goal of finalizing the contract before the end of the month to avoid an overage charge.","Maki: thank you. Hi, makki. Hi, Signe. How you doing?
Signe P: Good, happy Friday.
Maki: Yes, much needed for today for this week.
Signe P: I agree.
Maki: Great. I love the picture of your daughter.
Signe P: Yes.
Maki: Wow. She's so pretty.
Signe P: Thank you, Gemma. That's a few years old. I need to get an updated one but I just like it too much.
Maki: Yeah, it's beautiful. Both of you look beautiful. Thank you. Good. So, I had a meeting with a discussion with keskay, and then I think I'm tasked with finding out the pros and cons of the current plan versus the enterprise plan. So it'd be nice to know like the very details of what we get with the current plan and then what we would get with the enterprise plan. I googled it, but I think, and then, you know, I'm going to map it to our purposes and see which one is better.
Signe P: So the, let me pull up your contract. So, I think there was some confusion where he thought it ended in to 20 26, but it actually goes to 20 27. And so for the options that I sent over first, like to actually, I'm going to just pull up the email I sent him and I'll just talk through.
Maki: Okay.
Signe P: I told him. So, I kind of broke it out a little bit and if there's like certain things that he's confused about that I can make sure to clarify, just let me know.
Maki: Okay. So it looks like either way we're going to be paying for the overage, right?
Signe P: So, well, it depends like I was hoping to get this done today, so that you didn't have to pay an overage. But if we don't get this done before the first, then there's going to be an overage. So I'm willing and dedicated to trying to get this done for you guys. So you don't have an overage.
Maki: So, it's going to be waived to be clear if we get it done today.
Signe P: The month of August overage would be waived if we were able to do this today. So I put in and I can show you. I… know we're kind of going all over the place, but I'll just let you know what I've tried to do.
Maki: Okay.
Signe P: Long road. I don't know if you shared this, the new agreement with you or the draft.
Maki: No hold on.
Signe P: Is that the new one? Yeah. Okay. So, what was the, what… was the question?
Maki: Sure, absolutely. Hey, no problem. We don't have a lot going on. No problem. So I think it would be nice to know the current, what we get with the current plan.
Signe P: Okay. I think that's this one. Let's start with this one. Okay? Right now, you guys have 40,000 credits for 50 K. So that's about a dollar 25 per credit.
Maki: Okay.
Signe P: So, yeah. Now, I remember what I was going to show you right now. You're over you're past the 40 K mark. So you're starting to accrue the overage credits by the end of this month, it's I put in the new contract about 5,500 courtesy credits to cover that overage so that you don't have to pay for it, but it might be a little less than that. But anyway, so you'll have about 5,500 overage credits for this month, which is a one time fee which does not go towards your future usage. So it's just kind of a waste of money. And that's what I'm trying to prevent is that I don't want you to like cause next month, if we don't figure this out today, you're going to have more overages next month and so, and they're a dollar 25 per credit. It's a one time fee. So, none of this is being added to your current agreement to go forward and to reuse those credits as you need. So what I'm trying to do is give you the best investment for what you're going to be spending because we do see that by the end of the contract in January, you're going to need about 38,000 more credits. I know that there's a possibility for cleanup, but I also know that you're doing some new stuff. And so just to go off of what the trend is and what you guys are doing, it'd be about 38,000 credits at a dollar 25. And so that's where, let me pull up that email. I kind of wrote it out.
Maki: Would you please, would you please send the contract to me if it's okay?
Signe P: Yeah. Let's see. Where does he step in? Okay? I'll just pull this up. Oops, you don't need to see my spotify? I don't know what else is behind here, but I'll minimize as I need.
Maki: Right.
Signe P: Okay. So this is what I said. The current agreement is 40,000 credits at 50 K spend, Coverage, your over, sorry overage, 40 4,800, as of yesterday, project, projected overage, 38,000. So option one, if you purchase the 38,000 which we project that you're going to need, that's an additional 47,000 dollars. And then that means you'll have 79,000 more, total credits to use, not just the 40, but, if you buy the 38,000 credits, then that will go on to your contract. Huh. But that's a dollar 25. The second option is if you spend a little bit more like 2000 dollars more and get to the 100 K mark, because that's going to be a total spend of 97,000. If you just get to the 100 K mark, the cost per credit goes to a dollar, not a dollar 25. So then you would have 90,000 credits. Does that, does that make sense?
Maki: Yeah. Okay.
Signe P: And then the option three is, if we, because I can restructure and renegotiate the contract to give you a better rate and the enterprise caps. And so if there, if you're willing to extend from 20 27 to 20 28, I can give you a dollar per credit for all of the credits, not just the additional credits. So, that would be 100,000 credits for 100,000 dollars. And you would have the enterprise caps which I think we briefly talked about. So, if that makes sense to you like the, let me see.
Maki: Okay. I think I have, I think that's good information. So just to check my understanding, so let's say, today, so the overage is going to be calculated every month, right? And then, so as of today, based on that screenshot, we're over 4,800 credits, right? Four to 800 credits. So if we finalize it today, then we're not going to have… to pay for those credits.
Signe P: Nope. I'll mute it. Yep. And I'll give you the credits back to cover it so that you don't have to get charged for those.
Maki: Okay. So, so, okay. That's gonna, so that's going to be, help us decide, right? Which is, this is going to help us decide.

Simon N: Yeah. Were all those folks doing, the overnight trip or just doing day trips up there?
Nate T: Most of them, I would say we probably got passed by about 20 to 30 people that were doing just the day, like people that were running it. Some people were running it. Some people were just really long day. It's pretty impressive.
Simon N: Yeah. Well, that's even more impressive that your daughter was able to knock that out. That's really cool. So, congratulations on the accomplishment… Chris, glad you were able to jump on.
Chris W: Yeah, thanks guys.
Simon N: And it's nice to officially meet you. We haven't had a chance to meet before. So appreciate you jumping on. And yeah, I look forward to helping you out with all things Domo here, moving forward. I'm your customer account executive. And yeah, between Mike, your solutions consultant and I've been working with Nate the last several months on just Domo and data related items. So glad you were able to hop in.
Chris W: Yeah, nice to meet you guys. Thank you.
Simon N: And you're located down in Florida, right? Yeah.
Chris W: I'm down in Tampa.
Simon N: Nice. Are you a big football fan rooting for the buccaneers down there or what are some of your interests?
Nate T: Chris loves the buccaneers.
Chris W: I'm a niners fan. Actually, the bucs aren't bad, you know, but I grew up in Indiana. It was like, I did not like the colts. So everybody's always thrown off by that. But yeah, been a lifelong niners fan. So definitely love football ready for the season to get going.
Simon N: Yeah, it's wild last week of August. It's here. We got college starting up this week. Yeah, it's that time of the year.
Chris W: It is.
Simon N: Perfect. We'll have a few items that I was hoping to cover off on today. And then I know we want to talk about the upcoming renewal in mid November as well. And Nate is kind of coming out of our previous conversations and have an understanding of the lay of the land a little bit at realtruck one touch base on kind of how the bi tool consolidation is going. I know you and I think some other folks on the team are going kind of department by department and doing the scoping process of, hey here's, the reports that you have today. You know, what do we need to recreate you know, what's of value and then replicating that in Domo? So, hoping to get a little bit of a, you know, pulse check on how that's going, if there's anything that we can do to support that or if there's maybe been a shift in initiative regarding… the tool consolidation, just how you guys are looking at that.
Nate T: Yeah, it's definitely a process and we have, we've started it. We've started not necessarily just recreating but kind of envisioning and creating new reports. A lot of it is dependent on our engineering team and if they can combine the data from many different ERP systems to be pulled into GCP. Like so we're reliant on them being able to create it. But yeah, we're it's still very much in infancy, but we're working through it.
Simon N: Yeah, but remind me what the tools are that the engineering team uses to integrate the different erps, I believe majority of which are Netsuite and pushing that data into GCP.
Nate T: We've already got the Netsuite connection down. It's the other erps, and Chris, you would have a better understanding of this, but they're using a combination of different GCP data fusion like dataproc, right? What other?
Chris W: Yeah. Some of the native stuff that's just built into GCP, okay with odbc connectors and such. Some of the systems that we're talking to are very dated. So we're kind of limited there, but we've got everything set up now and it's flowing. So just time to start building reports.
Simon N: Perfect. And it sounds like you're getting a good understanding there of what those reports are and then what kind of when those get built out, then the ",Consumption Pricing Model,226902.83,Corporate,TRUCKXL.COM,5,Automotive,98,$500M to <$1B,Renewal,Blank,3: Demonstrate Value,Kate Barlow,2025-11-16,2024-12-20,2024-12-20,2025-10-09,,,,,0013800001I0stAAAR

Jason J: Man. I know you're not up there, but Utah gone wild. What the?
Phil S: Dude. I know it is terrible.
Jason J: It's I've… been pretty good on September elevenths for quite a while because, I mean, you probably don't know I was doing work in the pentagon at the time and I was on the way down there and I would have been in the windows that got hit because I was, we were doing, I worked for a window tailed company that we were, we had government contracts because the films we were putting on would laser microphones from coming through before that, they had suction cupped speakers on all of the windows and they would have acdc, the black CD playing out of CD players in every office that had a window for the same reason. Like that would just distort it. So, like they were hearing the rock music instead of what's going on in the buildings. Because also, at that time, you could take laser or laser microphones and get the resonance of the hard drives running and be able to read data off of them too.
Phil S: Oh, man. No, I didn't realize that, oh, yeah, this was.
Jason J: What I was doing back in 2000 and stuff. And like that, this is why I like went over to Bahrain right after nine. Like, I had just got in a car accident or like right before that too, and like screwed up my arm and everything real bad. The Guy rolled over on top of me a couple of times, 2001 was not a good year for me. Let's go with that one. So we're, I'm going over to Bahrain, got my arm in a sling still basically to go do some, film on the, base that was over there because everything's heating up, of course, and they're like, no, we gotta get this security film over on here so we can prevent any type of, signals intelligence leakage.
Phil S: Oh my gosh.
Jason J: Yeah. Like I still have my pentagon badge. Like, I had full 24 seven access to the pentagon with like multiple, like I could bring visitors in too. Like I, a couple times, I was like, come on, whoa, you wanna go walk around the pentagon? It took, it just took random people and we went walking around. I was also there after all of it too, to help re, like, we redid the windows once they put the new ones in and stuff. So, we were actually part of project Phoenix too.
Phil S: Oh my gosh. Yeah, but you were, you would have been in the windows but like, where were you at? Instead?
Jason J: In traffic on the way down because we drank too late last night and didn't feel like usually we, because we all live in Baltimore, or pretty much on the north of Baltimore too. Yeah. And we'd actually kind of come down 27 usually and then cut over to get to DC, but we'd leave at like four in the morning to beat traffic. Usually. Well, all we had to do was go in, pick up our equipment. We left there because we, I was the one that cut the window film. It was really thick stuff. It was just bomb blast film too. And we had this big, cutter it was, it's just a plotter like that does vinyl and stuff. But I was the one that ran like set all that up, figured it out and was cutting all the films to exact size. So the guys could just go through and put them up. So, we were going to pick that thing up and we had to put sealant around three of the windows that we didn't finish over the weekend and it, they were right where the plane hit. Oh, wow. Yeah, that's the freaky part.
Phil S: That, is that'll.
Jason J: that's yeah, I mean, it stays with you. It does, it does. Yeah. Now, what's ridiculous is here's? Here's? Kind of another of the funny stories with this. The Guy that actually got me that job was a friend from Ohio and, he was working with us at the time, but, he was a car tint. Okay. All he did was car tinting, and stereo installation. That's how they talked me into coming down there because I wanted to do car stereo stuff. But they pretty much quickly figured out, hey, dude, I can do many more things. So literally I took over like anything electronic. I actually rebuilt their set up a new server for them, got them off of single dos computers, stuff like that. So, he… went back to Ohio telling people that he was there dragging people out. He weren't even on the job with us let alone going down there and we weren't even taking the team down when we went down because it was just me and my boss at the time because like I said, we were just finishing up those couple things. But… gosh yeah, wild.
Phil S: That is wild that's one.
Jason J: Of those wild things.
Phil S: Forever. And that's one of those things that like, yeah, I'm sure. Every single September eleventh, you're gonna like, yeah.
Jason J: And that's what I'm saying. I really, it hasn't been, it hasn't been at all. But with this yesterday now, for some reason, it's kind of added on to it man. And it's kind of like I am extremely blah today.
Phil S: Yeah, me too. I'll be honest, like, I didn't sleep well last night like, oh, it's just.
Jason J: Like I, and to be honest, the first time I've actually even watched the dude was today, I put on some of his stuff watching it. I knew who he was, but, like, okay, how, like, is he saying stuff? Like, like what's he saying? That brings this? It was kind of my curiosity, you know, I haven't seen anything. So.
Phil S: Yeah, no, I mean, it's just there's all that discussion of it. He had a, he had a four year old and a two year old. I have a four year old and two year old. So, yeah.
Jason J: It's like, I mean, terrible.
Phil S: You know, in any way? Like.
Jason J: Yeah. So young, I mean, beautiful family. Yeah, it, I mean, I just don't… get it. Yeah.

Ashish C: Good. You back home?
Eric S: Back home, yep. Yeah, it's been a week man. Yeah… hey, James. How are we doing?
James H: All right. I think I'm connected and good now.
Eric S: Yeah, we can hear you good.
James H: All right. How you doing?
Eric S: Good. You.
James H: Good.
Eric S: Good. Thanks for, thanks for jumping on.
James H: No problem.
Eric S: I have you met Ashish?
James H: I have not yet.
Eric S: I'll let him do a brief intro, but he is now aligned as your CSM, one of the best at Domo. So I'm grateful to have him. He's been at Domo a long time, but Ashish, take it away.
Ashish C: Yeah, sure. Hey, James. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you. Yeah, I've been with Domo for about 10 years, just working in this role. Before this. I was with Adobe systems… and with a company called Omniture that was started off by our current CEO. So just kind of been following him around my whole career. I'm out here in Utah in the out of HQ. So, yeah, looking forward to working with you guys.
James H: Yeah, great. It's nice to meet you. I don't know. I can do a quick intro if that's helpful.
Ashish C: Yeah, that'd be great. Yeah.
James H: So, James heckert… I run the digital technology team here at arkea a little bit about arkea. We were basically a private company that acquired the largest renewable natural gas producer and kind of landfill to electric producer in the country in 20 21. That company was named aria energy. And then by the end of that year, arkea went public and then about one year later arkea was acquired by BP. So now since this would be… I guess technically right around the beginning of 20 23 until now, so almost two full years under BP and we're just kind of acting as like just one of the entities under their umbrella kind of on the renewable natural side, and working to be producing as many new plants and stuff as possible to… technically, I guess it's two years ago. Yeah, we've been, hold on now. It would have been last year. So last year, we put something like 12 new sites online this year. I believe we're around like seven. We scaled back quite a bit just because a lot of cost the reasons and stuff. But also the way we pretty much set us such a high goal, in 24 that we kind of had like burnout and everything. Like we were really rushing to try and get things done and then try to maintain them online and everything. So scaled back a little bit. So there's a little bit better launching off for new sites. But yeah. So we're, we kind of exist, in two methodologies off of the landfill, and taking in their gas contents and either turn it to electric or sell it into the pipeline. And then I oversee a digital team that focuses kind of primarily on business intelligence and kind of applications and sas tools and things like that to put in the user's hands to try and find efficiency gains, and all those kinds of things. So visual transformation.
Ashish C: That's awesome. That's a cool use case you got there and business together. Is, is that something that's regional global or what's your reach?
James H: We're national technically like lower 48 perspective, but I think we're only in 31 states total at the moment.
Ashish C: Okay, cool. And the Domo, as far as, your reach, is it operations or is it expanding new business identification and what, what's that?
James H: Look like, yeah, we're not really in like business development side so much here. I don't really know a lot about what all they're doing and tools they're using for stuff like, we kind of interact with them on a perspective of giving them data related to all the landfills that basically the epa publishes about. So, they do kind of come into Domo there. But from there's, another person that we'll get you to meet at some point. Probably definitely for an in person if we work that out. He's helped us basically strategically interact with probably 80 to 90 percent of the data at this company. So we're involved with accounting and finance. All of the data within operations primarily is in Domo and that is the bulk of our company. We're at least loaded 50 to 55 percent of like staffing and stuff inside of operations because obviously field workers, and everything that goes to support that. But we're helping health safety, environmental. What else is there off top my head… leadership? All all those things were we're pretty highly connected to basically every system, that we're working. And we are using Domo as our sole visualization tool across the company. I think there has been like little pockets like internal to certain like divisions where they might use Power BI because of familiarity to just like do some use cases like in, inside that group, but we don't do licenses and stuff to those types of tools because we want everyone to be using Domo.
Ashish C: Okay. Yeah, that's great. It was it, Tyson, Hollis? Is that? Yep. Okay. Yeah. I know we, I had another CSM reach out to me that she met Tyson at one of our connections events.
James H: So just recently.
Ashish C: Yeah. In Dallas, I think, yeah. Was it the fourth? Maybe something?
James H: I think that event ended up being like 918 or something like that. Yeah, I was gonna be there, but then I was sick, so I was like, I don't want to get people sick. So I guess I'll stay away. Good?
Ashish C: Call, yeah, yeah, yeah, no, we, I.
Eric S: Was just gonna say sheesh, that Tyson and I haven't met yet either. And so, I'd love to get introduced to him because I know, I don't know if Jameson was working with him directly, you know, contractual stuff at least before I got on. And then, you know, obviously I talked to you at Domo palooza, but would love to get introduced to him and make sure that, you know, the obligations and the questions that he has are aligned with, you know, how I'm supporting you and how we're supporting him. So, yeah.
James H: Yeah… he also stays here around Dallas. So, yeah, if we do an on site like at our office or whatever, it'd be an easy person to get in good.

So he's like there's a few things configuration, things we need to do apparently, and then he may walk us through exactly kind of, what these mean? So we understand the metrics correctly?
Matt T: Yeah. If you want to open up another window, we'll look at your subscription. So, if you go to more after that, and we'll look at your company dashboard. So go to more admin, and then underneath there, you'll have your credit utilization underneath your company settings, yep, Qlik on that. And then if you'll go to subscription… great.

The team identified several areas for improvement, such as aligning the packet structure with the overall job hierarchy, handling weekend work and overtime, and enhancing the skills matrix dashboard to provide more meaningful insights for the HR team.","Juliana J: hey, Ted.
Ted S: Hey, Jason joining here shortly, I think.
Juliana J: Okay. Everyone's a little late today. I thought I was going to be late and I was the first person here. This is my last meeting of the day and I've been back to back since eight o'clock mountain. So I feel like everybody's having one of those days.
Ted S: Yeah, Monday's catching up to me too. I'm trying to get it to where that screen doesn't keep popping up with the funky camera, but it keeps wanting to show you. Yeah.
Juliana J: I know I was going to say, is that a paper?
Ted S: Towel, it's what was in front of me?
Juliana J: That's okay. No worries. Cool. I know, oh, well, I was about to say, I think Brian's going to be a little late, but as I was saying, that he appeared, so, I guess he's not going to be very late.
Ted S: My other meeting got canceled. So, oh.
Juliana J: Cool. Good timing. Okay. So, we had two items on the agenda today. The first thing was more stuff on manning, I believe some discovery on phase two that we needed to do. So, I'll turn that over to Nick and will and we also wanted to go over some more stuff for the skills matrix updates. So we'll do that. The second half of the call, if that makes sense?
Ted S: Sounds good. Yes, I had seen that the manning app had been shared, but unfortunately, I haven't played with it much yet. So that's okay. Excited too though.
William W: I'm not mad about that. It's in one of those phases where you fix something and something else breaks. So it's not ugly.
Ted S: Jason buggs.
William W: Yeah, that's exactly right. So, yeah, I'll hand it over Nick. I don't know if you huh.
Nik K: Yeah, I'm just trying to find where I'd started my notes. So I think… we were trying to stitch back. Okay. Yes, I remember now. So for phase two of the manning app, we want to build out that whole production tree, right? So we have a weld start date that's… coming out of the data that's being used in the first stage, what we want to do is now take that packet, decompose it into its lots, the individual jobs and parts and items, right? And then essentially figure out based on the amount of time the operations are going to take for that item, stitch it back and get the total hours by part and by lot and all the way up and then do the sequencing, right? What order do we approach it in? So we were poking around the data behind the dashboard. You shared with us the weld op list or open weld op list, I guess, and had some questions, sure.
Ted S: Yeah, it's a hodgepodge of a few different data sets. So, I think drilling down to exactly where you want to look is probably worth your time.
Nik K: Yes.
William W: That ETL is fantastic by the way.
Ted S: Thank you. Yes, going back and trying to make any changes. I get a little confused every time.
William W: If it ever helps, you can right Qlik and drop a comment and I just put boxes around the things and just put like a light just… like a descriptor. So it's easier to find. But, you know, not putting it in there is job security man.
Ted S: Keep.
William W: this thing as ugly as possible, you know?
Ted S: Yeah, it's totally crazy.
William W: Yeah, this is a piece of art man. I'm a big ETL Guy. So, I always like to see, you know, big wild webs that have been weaved like that.
Nik K: Okay. So I think the best thing we can do, and we tried to do this last time and maybe we just didn't find the right jobs and packets. But if you could help us identify a good representative packet and lot, right? That has a good enough sort of production tree behind it, where we can see dependencies and trace it back through the data, that would help.
Ted S: Yeah. Let me pull one up. That comes to mind. The packet name would involve the words air sleeve… and I can give you the job number would actually filter you down probably closer to it if you want to punch that in.
Nik K: Air packet type sleeve.
Ted S: Packet. It'd be packet name, sorry, not packet type. Those will just be a I.
Nik K: mean,
Ted S: oh, you are sorry. I saw packet type highlighted. Oh,
Nik K: sorry about that.
Ted S: Yeah. So if you pick probably the bottom one would be an easy enough representation.
Nik K: Okay.
Ted S: So this actually is just a single lot, but it does have some complexity to multiple tiers of assemblies and part numbers.
Nik K: Okay. I guess we have two lots.
Ted S: Two in the job. I don't know if there's two in that release though. I would assume there… would have only been a lot one, but maybe there is a lot 100.
Nik K: Okay. Sorry, I'm just copying.
Ted S: And that's just what came to mind. I'm sure there's others that would be.
Nik K: Okay. So when, what's how does project kind of fit in? Is that the same as?
Ted S: Package, the project is just at the job level. So we'll receive an order from our customer that's only entered once. Assuming that the order involves a lot of different parts, we could have as few as one packet, one packet name, or as many as five to 10 that's more rare. But the project would be a job level. So a purchase order level entry, but the packet will be a compilation of the different lines that make up that job.
Nik K: Okay. Perfect. Okay. So we've got one… job. Let's assume, let's just go with zero zero one, right? And a… lot is zero zero one, then we should see items… in here, right? Which we do… is the sequence number here, the order of the sequence number rather of significance?
Ted S: I don't believe, so, no, that's just a randomly generated number within our ERP system. Okay? And so there's the item sequence number will correspond to a part that you're making. And then all the operation sequence numbers, the op sequence number refers to the specific operation that's actually required in order to produce that part.
Nik K: Okay. Perfect. All right. Okay. And these are different. Okay. So here we have job world start date, right? This is what we're using at the top level. So what does this actually signify.
Ted S: so again, that would be similar to the project field. Like those are entered in the same sort of condition. Where one, what we have a job number will have only have one job weld start date.

Okay. Okay. I'll see you then. Thank you. Hey, mark.
Mark M: Hey, how are you, josh? I'm doing well.
Josh F: How are you?
Mark M: Not too bad.
Josh F: How's your day? Is it warm outside? I think I was warm when I went out for a walk earlier.
Mark M: Yeah, I think, I mean, I've only been out once for like just a minute or two, but yeah, it's, getting warmer.
Josh F: Nice man.
Mark M: Are you in Utah though?
Josh F: Yeah, I'm right down the street. I'm in American fork actually.
Mark M: Oh, okay. Oh, cool. Well, I'm in Spanish fork. So, I guess we're in opposite forks.
Josh F: Opposite forks. Yep. Hi, fui.
Fui K: How's it going? Mark? Hey, good. How you doing? Fui, doing well, man. Great job again at the user group. That was incredible. That was awesome. I mean, just the whole experience of going from, you know, we were originally, we're going to start with you and then we thought about it. We're like, you know, let's start with on the court, you know, and then on the field. And then it just worked out and came full circle. So, I don't know if you saw there's just a little thank you gift that we sent it's from a, it's called sendoso. So I'm not sure if you saw that email come through.
Mark M: I haven't seen the email. I saw your email with the link, but yeah, I haven't okay. And you can use that link too. So, yeah, I don't know if BYU's email is like filtering it or what? But I.
Fui K: have, when was it sent? Oh, that's a good point. It was yesterday.
Mark M: Yesterday. Okay. Well, I'll keep an eye.
Fui K: Out for it. Okay. But if not, that link that I included should work as well. So let me know. Yeah. All right. Well, thank you. Thank you for that. Shoot me a text otherwise. So, yeah, but I think, you know, the rest of our team, there's a few of us on here and I think have you had the pleasure of meeting josh balolo, the new great adm? Awesome. Well, I mean, ultimately, right? You have a whole host of resources ready and available to support you and the team, Dave. And so again, it was great to catch up with the team overall… as we look at some of our customers and some of our partners, right? We look at just how they're leveraging Domo as a whole. And again appreciate the way that you were able to storytell that and demo that for the extended church users. And so, one of the things that we noticed was just, we have what's called our quick start or credit utilization reporting that hasn't been enabled yet for the BYU broadcasting team. And so that's why we had josh reach out to set this conversation up just to help you build that reporting. So you're aware of from a tracking standpoint and a usage standpoint, you're aware of where you are today. But also from a capacity standpoint, you know, within the consumption model, there's a number of different features, a number of different functions, things that you can leverage, we call it quote, unquote keys to the kingdom, right? So you can plug and play and test as appropriate. And so with that, any questions or hopefully that makes sense? So.
Mark M: Far, no. I did look in the admin thing and it looks like we do have a credit utilization thing which I think is pretty new. It kind of breaks out the legacy credits and all the other ones. So that's good to see. I know we've been asking about how we check that for a while. So it's good to see it in there.
Fui K: Absolutely. And this exercise is one that will give you the opportunity to break down how usage, what usage looks like, right? Okay, you know, and based on frequency based on, you know, which your use cases, right? And whatnot, but I think as far as this exercise is concerned, we can actually walk you through that. So if you're able to share your screen and then Shana, our solutions consultant, I like to call her. The brains of our team does a great job just at least helping you get, you know, kick things off. So you're aware of what that looks like. And again, from a capacity standpoint, we just want to make sure that you're able to keep track. But also, you know, if there's any additional use cases or ways that you can leverage demo as a whole, I want to make sure that you're fully aware of that. So with that, I'll turn it over to you, Shana, on the solution side.
Shana B: Yeah, mark, if you want to share your screen just so that we're looking at your actual environment and numbers that'll make more sense than demo numbers. Yeah, there we go. Yeah. So it looks like you found the admin section. So we've got two different options or two kind of different ways we can look at this. Our admin section is going to go over in more of an aggregated form. So at a monthly level, you're right? It breaks out the legacy versus standard and we can walk through like it's going to show what your credit balance is. We can go through all of that detail and what that looks like. We also have what we call a quick start dashboard with details on credits you used. What this does is it takes a couple of domostats datasets. So some metadata on, you know, who owns the content, what the dataset names are, and how many credits they've used, puts it together in an ETL, and then spins up a dashboard with a couple of charts for you… and it goes into more detail. So if you are interested in seeing the usage like by dataset by day, really granular level, then we'll want to spin up that quick start.
Mark M: Okay. Yeah, no, I think that would be really good. Is it, how many credits does that use? Just the quick start one?
Shana B: So the quick start has three datasets and one ETL that power it. But of the datasets, you know, one of them is the people dataset which is users in Domo. Those don't change all that often. So probably don't need like that could be one, you know, if people are not wanting to run them very often. Like that's one that often gets run manually, the dataset names. One again, that depends if you're building a lot of content, maybe we want to run that more frequently. If you're not building a lot of new content, you'll know if you haven't run that one because things will show up with no names and you'll wonder what's the dataset name.

William S: Yeah, that's the big push right now and trying to do that before the end of the year? Is?
Casey D: Everything going well with that? Is there any hiccups or anything we want that you need help with… still?
William S: To be determined, we're still going through that process. So, okay. Yes, I'll let you know though we start next week.
Casey D: Okay. Good deal. And, for everybody involved here, you have plenty of service hours available too that we can utilize, for demo technical assistance if and where needed any kind of working sessions or troubleshooting, anything that's not like a support break fix issue that Kyle normally handles like if it's anything about like what's best product to use in this situation, solution, designing if you have a new use case or anything like that, we can always use those hours for that, William.

William S: Not, not this on case. I think we're still internally… looking through some of that stuff. Okay?

Casey D: About. Okay? Sustainability GFX, is done yep.
Devin P: And then, yeah, the app studio, we did the POC for that. That looked good. We reviewed that as a team. I forgot last week or the week before.
Casey D: Inventory and order dashboards.
Devin P: Those were still working on the exception and the inventory. Those are, they're still in our backlog. Okay?
Casey D: Backlog… I'll update that later is… Ravi on or, I guess, yeah, I think call that.

Casey D: Deal. Yeah, let us know if there's anything else you need from our side. We'll do.
Chris L: Okay.
Casey D: What about gff? Who's got some gff updates? Anything from? Gosh. I, I've been collecting these updates I think since our last QBR, so it, some of these could be older. And yeah.
Chris L: Let's see. I mean, the first one's still definitely ongoing. We really don't have our even our first suggestion back into nomon's group. But hopefully soon… the second one's kind of waiting on you guys. If, there's a way to bring those annotations from data into a line or bar graph.
Casey D: Okay.
Chris L: The project… manager, customer onboard and dashboard, is really in maintenance mode right now. There may be some changes coming soon, but it's still, it's active, but, you know, functional, I actually need to work with Andy to get it all promoted into production because it's still in uat, okay… integration technology dashboard kind of on hold. We had to bring some other solutions in just to show some data that we lost the standard visibility to. So that one's kind of holding although it'll come back and the Roi dashboard, we're working on the underlying data right now, not the dashboard. But as soon as that's done, that dashboard will come back to life. Cool. And I mean, expansion symphony probably more goes hand in hand with the leveraging data from SC 360 than anything. You know, that's really about making sure we identify the things that we're doing ad hoc and bring them to, you know, the data governance that the SC 360 governance team to say, you know, how do we get this domain data in there as something formal rather than ad hoc? So I think those two kind of go together. Okay?
Casey D: And then as far as the QBR, Chris, I saw your email, we're looking at mid… October or something like that, but you'll let us know right what date.
Chris L: Yeah, we just need a couple days. Like I said, we've been asked to kind of completely revamp the way it works. I think good request with good guidance from leadership. And so, you know, right now and I think Kevin partially responded. But some thoughts around what you would present as, the Domo innovations. And there's an ask from our leadership to really only present those innovations. If we see an application for them, you know, with ups, I don't think that's hard to figure out. So I think my question was should we really just look at the latest and upcoming releases or do you guys have ideas around?

Jeff M: mean, Sam, we're just in just at another meeting together. It does. It's a little laggy getting in. I don't know why the zoom is a little slow, but it took me a second.
Scott B: Sure. Hi, Hisham.
Jeff M: Okay. Morning.
Ashish C: I.
Adam L: think here we go. Yeah, it took a few seconds to, yeah.
Jeff M: It's a little like slow on the load, but it gets you there eventually.
Scott B: Yeah.
Sam D: Yep. I was having trouble as well. Sorry about the delay. Well… all right. We'll blame zoom.
Adam L: That's a good plan that's a good plan.
Jeff M: Easy target.
Sam D: I think we have everyone, right? We got to see Adam, mohammed, shish, Scott, Ben, good to see you guys.
Scott B: All right.
Ashish C: Yeah, thanks for everyone joining. Obviously, this is a great time for us to connect and reconnect from the call that we had a few months ago. A lot of progress has happened since that previous engagement and we've been working closely with Sam. I'm Ashish, cardwell. I'm your CSM, I'm relatively new to the account. I've been working with Sam for the last four months or so. I'm so excited to help this conversation move along. I think everyone else knows each other, Adam, maybe you're the only other person that needs an introduction from the Domo side. Sure. So, if you want to share, and then we can maybe get started here.
Adam L: Yeah. Hey, great to meet you guys. I've heard, you know, I've got quite a download on what you guys have been up to and seeing how you guys have been basically crushing it with Domo and want to see how I can help with, you know, whatever's next there. But I've been at Domo originally was here when we started the company worked on the product for several years until I left for a startup learned the error of my ways during that and came back about a year and a half after I did that. And I've been here since then. And what I do now is I primarily focus on helping customers like you guys who really want to get the most out of the platform, get coaching, guidance, best practices, technical help when you need to. I run a program that is specifically around driving customer adoption and customer engagement forward by enabling them to solve their problems. So, yeah, really looking forward to seeing what I can add to the conversation today.
Sam D: Random question for you. Adam, do you sit near Dan Hendrickson?
Adam L: Yes, I do. And Dan is actually on my team.
Sam D: Okay. Yeah. Whenever I join your webinars, it looks like you have the same view he has. Yeah. So every.
Adam L: time we do one of those webinars, he goes, can I use your office? And I go? Yeah, for sure.
Hisham A: Your.
Ben S: office is famous who?
Hisham A: Knew you don't need to use any fancy background?
Adam L: No, I know.
Ben S: He.
Adam L: was amazing.
Ben S: I actually.
Sam D: I was going to say, do you, I think one of your customers is right across the street, right?
Adam L: Yeah. Well, yeah, because we're I mean, we're local to Utah.

I'm gonna stay off camera for this meeting.
Bellamy Y: Me too. Hey, Ben.
Benjamin P: Hey, Bellamy. How are.
Ankit S: you? What's up Bellamy?
Bellamy Y: Good. How are you guys?
Ankit S: Happy Friday.
Bellamy Y: Yes, happy Friday.
Benjamin P: You got big weekend plans.
Bellamy Y: No, gotta pack because we're moving next week?
Ankit S: Did you say you're moving to Philly? Yeah, nice. Cool. Yeah. Where in Philly? Which area?
Bellamy Y: Point breeze? Okay. Point breeze, it's like in the city somewhere south city?
Benjamin P: Gotcha. Well, good. You'll be Eastern Time with us?
Bellamy Y: I know. Yeah… it'll be nuts hanging out with people on the west coast.
Ankit S: Okay. Yeah. You're coming a good time of year as well?
Bellamy Y: Oh, yeah.
Ankit S: Yeah, I love the fall in the northeast. It's my favorite.
Bellamy Y: Oh, I'm excited now.
Benjamin P: Well, the update I have for today, so, a couple things. Yep… that's the wrong.
Bellamy Y: Shane's been busy.
Benjamin P: All right. So two things, I have this… geocoded data set with a 1,000 addresses in it. I just did a 1,000 for now so that we could do our testing. I'll run the others too later. I just wanted to make sure a 1,000 worked the way I did. So that was good. So I have a jupra workspace with that code in it. I have created this output data set. You can see if I get a latitude, we have latitudes here. If we get a longitude, we have longitude here. So that was done, the other big piece that this actually took a good bit, a bit of time to just get, the custom app deployed. Since it is using react. There's some dependencies and I had to use the demo command line interface to get this published. So it was a little bit technical, but I've got, the Kepler app deployed here. And inside of this talent acquisition dashboard, I have one page and it actually has the map inside of your demo instance now. So it wasn't it when I showed it to you the other day, it was just on my local environment, but I've actually got this deployed into your instance now. And so this was a big hurdle I wanted to get past because now the rest of it is just doing the coding to tie the data to, the actual interface. And so the process of getting the maps embedded, the process of deploying that to your instance is an app and putting it inside of an app studio page. All of that is done. And we have, the latitude log streams now for a sample of addresses that we can use to start populating this with, some real data points. And so, I'm really happy with the progress, that we've been able to make this week on, this piece of the project, I expect that sometime next week, I'll have this map, in a place where it can actually be useful that's.
Bellamy Y: awesome. Thank you so much.
Benjamin P: And Bellamy, do you expect, do you expect to be making changes to this code base in the future at any point in time after we roll? What?
Bellamy Y: Do you mean?
Benjamin P: Like, so this is a custom app. And so there's code, right? That powers the app. Do you, do you think that you'll and the only reason I'm asking is because if you plan on making changes to the code or if you think that there's even a possibility that at some point in the future you will want to make changes to the code, I'll have to walk you through the process of doing that local development, you'll have to install node JS and react on your machine, and you'll have to get the, you'll have to get the demo command line interface so that you can deploy this, to the cloud. So.
Bellamy Y: Cool. I mean, if you send me materials, wait, hold on node JS. If you tell me about like the general flow in like a paragraph format that's all I need. Because then I can just feed that into chat into AI. Okay?
Benjamin P: Do you use a MacBook? Or do you use the windows I?
Bellamy Y: Use windows? Okay?
Benjamin P: So, let me check on that because the process and some of the commands might be slightly different because I'm using a mac OS. And so, let me just check before I send you any materials I need to check and make sure that my instructions are going to work for you since you're using a different operating system. Okay?
Bellamy Y: Yeah, because if you just give me like one, two three fours about like enough and even in like a high level, I can just feed it into chat. Jpt. Yeah.
Benjamin P: Yeah. It was this, it's sort of… it's all done through, the command line terminal. I don't know if you're comfortable with using slightly. Yeah. Okay. So, you know, we would install node. We would install. We would create the app, which that's been created. So you just download the app and you would be able to use the command line prompts to build the app and deploy it to your instance. So I can show you how to do that when the time comes. But like I said, I'll let me check and see if I'm pretty sure I'm almost positive that the commands that I use aren't going to work for you. So that's why I want to just check. Yeah.
Bellamy Y: Or organizationally speaking… because this talent acquisition right now, it's just, it's an app on its own. But in the future, I would want to have an office team app studio. And then within,, there would sit a talent acquisition page, is that easily configurable with the same set of settings that I know how. Yeah.
Benjamin P: We could do like… we could rename this to what would the dashboard be called? We.
Bellamy Y: Can call it like office team for now. So.
Benjamin P: we could do office team, and then we could have a page that's called talent… acquisition. And then we could do like… tabs. Yeah, we can put this in here.
Bellamy Y: It's easy. You can just drag and drop, okay?
Benjamin P: And then we could call this like mapping.
Bellamy Y: Mapping.
Benjamin P: Yeah, and then have another one that says HR… wait.
Bellamy Y: Wait, yeah.
Benjamin P: Apis or something like that.
Bellamy Y: Yeah. Okay. All right. Thank.
Benjamin P: You, I'll just refresh this so you can do it sort of like this. So you have your maps here. You have your, you know, your dashboard, your apis and that sort of thing. Okay?

Sam D: All right. Good old zoom. It's not as zoomy as it once was. It's definitely getting worse and worse. I feel like every time I use it.
Ashish C: Yeah, the heyday was covid, and then I died… down from there.
Sam D: You guys use multiple platforms, don't you?
Ashish C: Teams and zoom. Yeah, no one likes that. It seems, so.
Sam D: I was talking to, yeah, I was talking to Jace and he said Sony like forbids anything, but I think teams, oh, really? Yeah, he had said that, I guess the customer, you… know, that's their preference. So, yeah, I will say Google meets is getting better though. It's a lot better. Yeah, really like solid, you know?
Ashish C: Yeah, I like that as well.
Sam D: So, I'm not experiencing as many issues as we once were. They're kind of like catching up, you know?
Ashish C: But all.
Sam D: right, where did you want to start? I know you sent me an email. I am going to pull it up right now. I have not looked at the agenda, but what I will say is good news is I met with Hisham this morning, you know, I just wanted to like triple check with him because he's about to leave the country for like three weeks for vacation and, you know, yeah, I just want to make sure like, hey, you're going to be there, right? And he's like I'll be there. So, yeah. But the one thing he said was like, because he, you know, he's very, you weren't, you didn't you weren't at the on site visit, that we had and, you know, he's a stickler about agendas and doesn't want to waste his time and hates, absolutely, hates sales pitches, like I can't stress that enough. So, like, if we, if and when we get to like the ace program, right? Like, it cannot be like a sales pitch. It cannot be like a, you know, like it just has to feel real. I don't know how I don't know how to do that, but like, yeah, just say, no, I think.
Ashish C: I think it would flow well from the topics we're covering like we're talking about the rollout we're talking about like managing from a governance perspective. You're pulling in all these different resources for us, that kind of pull into these different conversations. And, you know, we're stretching ours a little bit thin, you know, with how much we're bringing from the engineering enablement team and other teams, what ace does is consolidates that into a single group. And then, you know, takes ownership of some of that content that we're you know, talking about with all these other teams, and gives it. So, yes, it is, it's a strategic team that we do recommend to our customers, some of our customers, aren't on a trajectory where they need engagement with that team. I think yours is a prime candidate for it just because of the direction you're going, how you engage with us, how you work with us, and, you know, we're continually aligning strategically. We need a team that's gonna sponsor that a little bit more effectively for you. Yeah.
Sam D: I think we should use like, maybe let's just start with ace because I know it's I know it's item number three. But here's how I think we can get it down to like, sort of less salesy, more realistic. Like, obviously, we pay for silver support, and, you know, silver support is really, you know, hey, something's broken, help me fix it, right? It's obviously also education. I don't want to downplay it, but, you know, some of the sort of real world examples, that we have experienced. And then Scott has called out and rightfully, so it's, and I think, this has to be sort of, very, this has to be very clear, because it can, also, this can kind of go, can be interpreted, in, you know, in a negative way and it's not meant to be, but, we have been working very closely together to shore up resources, to assist my team with, you know, Domo, enablement, right? So, things like bringing in real world examples like, you know, use the self service example that we just went through. You know, that, you know, we shored up Savannah and, Savannah kind of threw multiple, you know, engagements, helped us, you know, get from point a to point B, it's not to say that Domo isn't willing to, get the right people in the room to help get the job done. It's just that, the speed in which we are able to do that, will not be as, rapid, and the attention and the attention will not be as much. And that's a good example. I think of where, having like an, you know, the ace program and having like a resource can help us because it's like, hey, when you have those moments where you're like, I wanna build, you know, the self service framework or I wanna, enable AI, or I want to begin to take advantage of workflows and automate, you know, again, Domo's not saying we will not help you get there. We absolutely will, but the path of least resistance for lack of a better way of saying it, or the direct path, is generally speaking is through the ace program. I think that's how it should be sort of sold. So, so it's kind of like, hey, we'll keep doing what we're doing no problem. But just so, you know, if you want, especially if you, want your, you know, to, you know, your Domo enablement, to sort of, and you want, I think the key is like just, you know, you want to have like resident experts on tap, to help with the acceleration that you, that you had that, you know, don't that osj, is currently, looking for, from, in terms of Domo, in our ecosystem, you know, just consider, ace as like, like it's like almost putting nitrous oxide, in, you know, your supercar right? Like, or, you know, some, a car that you're racing, right? You know, it's like it's kind of having like nos, you know, like, so, you know, for lack of a better way of saying it. So, so that's I think that's kind of how I think we should, I think the more, we can bring in and I know mohammed's not connected and I know, Ben is actually a little more connected, because I talked to Ben a lot, right?

BrianWilliam 9: Yeah, that works. We just went through this is kind of unrelated but an office migration yesterday and over the weekend, so that's why my name has this weird code. I'm still setting some stuff up. I'm trying to get it fixed.
Ankit S: We just figured you were like,
EricGroetzin O: AI,
Ankit S: and, you know, you figured it out, you figured out how to just send someone at a meeting.
BrianWilliam 9: Yeah, I got my own bot, who has my own voice and my own thoughts.
Ankit S: It's getting so good. It sounds so accurate, right? That's fun though. Those migrations are always when… we go through them on our end, it's always like I'm… at the edge of my seat when we do any sort of Domo migration stuff.
BrianWilliam 9: Yeah, maybe I was a little paranoid. I like saved all of my files down that's in teams and box like just in case. Yeah, at least from that perspective, everything worked, just need to fix some of my accounts. Nothing crazy, but I think all things considered. I mean, it's not easy to do it. It's pretty. I think the outcome was pretty good.
Ankit S: Yeah.

EricGroetzin O: Hey, guys. Can you hear me?
BrianWilliam 9: Yeah, you're coming through good?

BrianWilliam 9: So be good now. Thank you guys for.
EricGroetzin O: Waiting for me.
Ankit S: Absolutely. So, Eric, Brian, I figured we can just start with, I know you followed up with Aishwarya's update from Friday… and maybe we could just start there and then just run through all those notes.
BrianWilliam 9: Yeah, I.
EricGroetzin O: Got a few.
BrianWilliam 9: items to add as well, but, yeah, go ahead Eric.
EricGroetzin O: Oh, yeah, good. Brian. Yeah, hopefully like my note wasn't too long winded. I think… what I'm trying to get across is we've got like a draft of everything set up, which is good. And I know there's like some formatting stuff we're going to tweak later, but how do we, like, I mean, there's kind of a lot, right? That doesn't tie or has small issues like bridge those gaps. How do we kind of prioritize and say like, okay, these are all of the issues that we know of like I think some of we've talked about already and some, you know, you guys needed us to validate, but I think that would be a wise use of our time… and I'm yeah, I'm happy to go through this email one by one. Maybe one quick clarifying question. Brian, you might know the answer to this. I was hoping Vu would be on today. Does everything link to… like, are we using the excel? I think we had previously mentioned there was like a switch where you can switch the data to where it's pointing at the excel pack, the financial reporting package or it's pointing to the raw data coming out of Domo from sage, like are… we pointing to the excel package right now? Or are we pointing to like the sage data?
Kristine F: My understanding is we're pointing to the excel, but there's a toggle to move it to the sage.
EricGroetzin O: Okay. That's what I thought too.
Kristine F: But we need to check that on every data set because we're going to have to use more than one data set. So we'll need to verify… all the data sets.
BrianWilliam 9: Okay.
Kristine F: Yeah. Let's check that. So, aish, can you add that to our list?
Aishwarya D: Yes.
Kristine F: It should be a toggle. And ideally, that hopefully goes just to sage at some point, right? We don't need all that extra data in there.
Aishwarya D: Well, on view calculations, we have added a formula that just looks at excel data set and brings up the amount. So these are the small filters or the conditions that we would need your help with validating. Yeah.
Kristine F: And we'll switch those beast modes to sage once that's official, right? So we will have to have number one right now. We can check to say these data sets are looking at excel, but we can toggle to sage and these ones we cannot at this moment. And then two would be what beast modes calculations or filters. Are we looking at the excel version and need to be flipped over? Hopefully we can just maybe take the data out and have sage, but as long as naming is correct, it should work but we will have that on our back end list backlog. I guess. Sorry that.
EricGroetzin O: Works and that's helpful for me to understand. Yeah, I think it's… good to know. I think what surprises me is, you know, pretty much every I'll… pull up the Domo dashboard, but like pretty much all of the charts and tables have, they don't like most like almost every number does not exactly tie. And so that's why I was wondering because I'm a little bit surprised if it's just pointing to the excel.

They also explored the process of updating the access token for the Domo integration and the possibility of pulling metadata information from Databricks into Domo to improve data discoverability, though the current Domo platform does not support a hierarchical view of data assets. The team agreed to follow up on these topics next week as Chris continues to work on the integration.","Chris G: hey, good afternoon, Scott.
Scott T: Hey, Chris. How you doing?
Chris G: Doing well. Thank you for the time today.
Scott T: Sure. Yeah, no problem. I don't know if anyone else is joining from the Domo side. That's why I was trying to touch base really quick. I don't think we need anyone, but let me just check. Yeah, I think that's it. Oh, Ivan's here. Look at that. I didn't know he was coming. So, I guess my first question is, do you have any questions or concerns about setting up the amplifier connection in production as opposed to sandbox?
Chris G: No, I just, I guess if we're going to go straight to production, then I was hoping to get my questions answered first just since that is our production environment. Our reason for wanting to, you know, go in sandbox was just to be able to answer our own questions with testing, but we just want to make sure we have a thorough understanding of what we're doing here before we start implementing straight in production.
Scott T: Okay. So.
Chris G: I think if we can just kind of talk through today, I've got all the information ready to configure, you know, technically, it looks like it's a pretty simple straightforward process. I just want to make sure understand kind of how updates are happening and, you know, when, how we would make changes to the environment as needed and just kind of what the impact is on some of the existing assets in the environment and kind of how this stuff will show up. Okay? Before we jump into that. Though, I did want to ask just quickly if you'd found any additional information on the API question that I'd put to you guys last week around the kind of return object type being able to get back that flattened Json versus nested array format.
Scott T: So, I feel like… yes, I did start down that. I don't remember what solution. So, do you remember which API endpoint you're calling? Like do you have?
Chris G: Yeah, it's the data sets, query API?
Scott T: Yeah. So if I go to hang on, let me just go here and I can share my screen in a second.
Chris G: All.
Scott T: right. So we have top… three. All right. So, we have like several different types of apis, right? So we have our app framework apis is like if you're doing it within the Domo environment, and then there's platform oauth, apis. Is this the one that you're using or are you using?
Chris G: I was using the product apis, but both the oauth and the product apis both have the same return type. The only difference I found is that the oauth apis, it actually shows it like, yeah, if you do query a dataset API that's the one here, this one actually shows in the sample return, the nested array format. So you can see like there, if you scroll down to the rows key… you know, it's there you go. It's you know, that array of arrays notation. If you look at the one in the product apis, the same under the datasets API. Yeah, the query with SQL that's the one right there, see it shows in the response that you're supposed to get that array of objects notation, but that's not what actually gets handed back. It's the same array of arrays.
Scott T: Because this is, that was, so, my thought was that you were using this one to query it and that's why the return was coming back that way but you've used it, it's like, I feel.
Chris G: like, yeah, and I even checked, you know, like just in the network tab, when you bring up the dataset details within the application, this is the call that it uses and it's using that array of arrays notation internally too.
Scott T: Ah, that's so weird.
Chris G: Anyway, we don't need to bog down on that… now that I.
Scott T: know that was what I was gonna tell you to do was to go to this other API endpoint. But if you've already tried that, let me, I'm gonna have to, and it is V3 that you're using like that, not V1 or two.
Chris G: I think it is V1, but that's what it shows in the example there this.
Scott T: One says V1. So, I would suggest trying, I don't know why they didn't update this, but I think we're on V3 now.
Chris G: Okay. I could do that. I.
Scott T: Could try that, but I will, that's just like one thing to try. I don't know that that's gonna fix anything. I will also go back to our product team and try to get a better answer for you, but I had thought that you were just using this oauth one and I would, my suggestion was gonna be move down here, but you've already tried that. So, yep. Yep. Yeah.
Chris G: Okay. Well, I will try that V3 and let you know how that.
Scott T: Works. Okay. And I'll get some more troubleshooting steps for us, but yeah, to my knowledge, I thought, I believe this is how it's meant to return. So that's what.
Chris G: everybody wants.
Scott T: Yep. And you're calling it from postman or something? Is that how it returns or is it?
Chris G: I'm testing this independently, just running it from python using the python request libraries. Okay?
Scott T: Yep. Okay. Interesting. All right. Well, yeah, I'll get you some more information, but that's those were my next steps. I was coming into the call with.
Chris G: Okay. Good deal. So, I guess questions specific to the cloud amplifier integration. So… we've, Not done anything through cloud amplifier before it's kind of a new feature for us. So, you know, we just want to make sure we're understanding what to expect, you know, if we're going to do this straight in production. So, first question I have is just really around what is the impact if any to existing datasets? When you bring in that cloud amplifier, do these, whatever datasets that you specify just, you know, show up like any other datasets just show that they're coming from databricks. But it doesn't you know, change anything with anything else in the environment. You're just adding in a new set of data sources.
Scott T: Yep. It would just be a new data asset. Differences between that and a traditional like one that's materialized in Domo. I've seen the first differences there's. The storage, right? Doesn't you know, charge storage there's like the querying of it happens like the charge for that happens like with wherever you said databricks or bigquery.
Chris G: Yeah, we're on databricks.

WAYNE W: Hello, got me now.
Michael D: I can. Hi, Wayne. All right. So I think we have everyone here. I'm not expecting Ron… and then we know Todd is out on pto. So I mean we'll start with, you know, the obvious, right? We know we have support tickets that are open and progress for the adrenaline data flows that were failing. And from my update earlier today, it still stands right? It's already been escalated. It's with our engineering teams and we're hopeful that they'll be able to at least give us another update. I know Kyle's pushing for that right now and more importantly a solution or a resolution to kind of get you guys flowing again in terms of your data, we can get ahead of any potential people reaching out to you asking where their update is. So we appreciate your patience. I know it's not what you want to hear but that's… the update that we have right now. I will say kind of going on further with that kind of that line of thought is the instance audit that we engaged our consulting team on are making progress and they're close to the point where we should have something to share in the way of kind of some findings and some recommendations. They're putting together some additional information in terms of like examples for like the next step of what we would propose to help, you know, just make the instance a little bit more stable. I am confident though that in terms of what they did find and how they're going to present, it should position you guys to have more stability on the instance in terms of, you know, the architecture, what you're using today in the way of adrenaline and finding some better solutions so we can get away from kind of managing these ad hoc fires that pop up for you guys. So hopefully by at least tomorrow, I would like to kind of send out some times where we could potentially kind of walk through those findings with the consulting team and then start discussing more of what's next in terms of how do we start getting you guys set up for success?
WAYNE W: All right, I appreciate that.
Michael D: Absolutely.
WAYNE W: Yeah, that's all good. I guess, you know, part of our confusion and… frustration to be honest is, you know, we've run fine for a given amount of time and then it just, you know, we run into these where everything just breaks, right? Or certain items break, and it's just hard to understand what causes those things to happen. You know, that's what I get asked the most. Well, what happened? Well, I don't really know well, it was fine yesterday. Yeah, it was. And so it's just, you know, it's very frustrating to we go periods of time with smooth functioning and we, you know, and this month has been rough to be honest. I mean, this is so, you know, the audit, I hope they come up with some really good recommendations. It's just, it gets very tiresome to be honest guys. I mean, every morning, it's okay. What possibly broke today? That we're going to have to explain or shut down reports or, you know, just, you know, it's we're very unstable. I just, I get all these other, yeah. Well, you know, sap reports are fine and the bi reports are fine. Why are your reports? You know, trashed? And it's just, it's hard and honestly, it's a little embarrassing. Really. It's just, we, we're not, you know, up to the standards of what this company expects day to day on reporting or it's just unreliable. It doesn't seem.
William M: Enterprise level.
WAYNE W: What's that, William?
William M: It doesn't seem enterprise level.
WAYNE W: Yeah. How, I mean guys one day all.
William M: The Redshift data flows are broken. The next day, all the adrenaline data flows are broken. Yeah. And then now there's some kind of communication issue within our instance because this wasn't just adrenaline data flows. We jumped to that conclusion, but that's not the case. I've posted an error for, from some C sharp code that uses the workbench API or dll… and we're having issues with the indexing from the cli tool. This is an instance wide WTF.
Michael D: Yeah. And I can appreciate, you know, the frustration of where you guys are coming from. I think again kind of looking at this audit, we're going to have to kind of look at some things differently and make some decisions on is the structure and the architecture that you guys have set up. Now, the best method for how you guys need to run based on the amount of data and the amount of processing that you need to do on your data for your reports. So I'm hopeful that once we can kind of walk through that, we can have a discussion and kind of come to an understanding of what we think is going to put you guys in the best position going forward, but that may entail us and I'll just be honest and Frank. It may require us to look at having a different architecture and setup that's more modern in terms of the amount of data that you guys have to process… a lot of. I think what was built is kind of carryover from josh Stan, and you guys have had this for a while and I think it's just now is probably a good time to say, is there a better method of how we need to architect this from a data pipeline standpoint, so… that we can reduce the amount of errors that we're getting across the instance, whether it's adrenaline or… workbench or any other areas?

Ankit S: Was like mid.

Ankit S: How long have you been in Denver?
Bellamy Y: It's less than a year, like about eight months now, eight, seven months. Cool. Yeah, nothing too crazy. I really like it here though.
Ankit S: Yeah, yeah. I know a few people that live out there, some of which are Jomo team members actually, right? And yeah, they love it.
Bellamy Y: Good. Let me just make sure Ziba's coming in, but otherwise we can totally go get started.
Ankit S: Awesome. Yeah. So agenda for this week and specifically for today is to,
Bellamy Y: have.
Ankit S: Ben essentially present the roadmap that we've been putting together… whether that takes today as well as the additional session on Friday, we just kind of want to get to a point where we're ready to move forward with that. And at that point, we'll loop in Vince who I believe you have met from our CS solutions team and he'll be able to put together a level of effort for everything that we would commit to. From there, we would then get a zero dollar bucket of hours essentially placed to our team so that we have something to log to and of course, just understand again just the level of effort that we'll have. And then we're pretty much ready to rock at that point. So hopefully… we can get that done in the next like two weeks, maybe less than two weeks, but that is the.
Benjamin P: Game plan. Yeah, I would expect that to be to happen by the end of this week. Hopefully, I don't expect, so. I do have the roadmap and I want to share that. And I don't think that there's a need for this to go beyond this meeting. And so just get Bellamy's thoughts. And, you know, I'd like to go ahead and begin executing on this as soon as we can. I know Shane had already started working with you on some of the geotuning stuff last week and so we can pick up on that later this week. Okay. So any questions about that Bellamy before we dive in that?
Bellamy Y: Decline map that I talked to Shane about that's like super tactical. So the earlier we knock that out, the better it is and then just a quick update about the one pager which was the other tactical piece. Hi, Ziba, is that Ziba and I actually, we played around with app studio and we set everything up actually, but we do have some questions like it's very elementary, you know, like things like drill downs. Do we have to press a button? And, you know, these kind of tactical questions to Polish the app studio? That would be, I think those two things would be a very low hanging fruit. So just fyi.
Benjamin P: Okay. Sounds good. So let's see. All right. So, I'm going to share my screen? And I can share this with you too after the call… but we've got based on the discussions that we've had up until now, I was able to identify five key… use cases that we've gone through. Most of these we've gone into a lot of detail. I'd say probably the concierge workflow is probably the one we've spent least amount of time on. But here are the ones that we've uncovered. So the AI chat for clinicians, I believe we said that was probably the one that was going to be furthest in the future is the AI chat because we still probably have some data that we're going to have to pull into your insights to support that. But that is one I'm probably just going to rearrange these in order of priority. These are not in order of priority right now. But I have on the next slide that we'll get to in a moment, I have prioritized these. So I'll just I'll shift these around after this call in order of priority before I send that over to you. The next one is the stakeholder portals. And so, you know, having those actual portals for each of primarily for the clinicians, right? So clinician portal. And then we identified a slide that you showed us early on that it wasn't just clinicians. There were a couple others and, you made mention that if we could assist with getting that clinician one stood up then you guys feel like you could run with the other ones. And so that's the reason I put portals here because in the long run we're hoping to have more than just one to support the clinicians but for the other departments as well. And so, I've got a little description of these two… and stop me at any time if any of this you feel like needs to be revised. But department dashboards. And so we've got five department dashboards on the next slide. I've gone into detail about each of these. But essentially, we've got the finance and billing. We've got that the clinical operations. We've got referral… referrals, and we've got HR and then there's one more. And so we'll go to those in just a moment. And then the concierge workflow, we had a meeting about that a whole working session with the team on that. And so that was the fourth one. And then the last one is this PDF scheduled reports that I think that was the one pager you may have been talking about. And so doing the scheduled reports for the 10 hospitals that you have, and then applying filters so that each of the hospitals can have a section of the data that's appropriate for them. And so those were the five. Can you think of any that don't fall into one of those buckets? I felt like that pretty much covered most of what we have discussed up until now.
Bellamy Y: Yeah. The fifth one is what",Consumption Pricing Model,51200.0,Corporate,21HHS.COM,1,Healthcare & Health Services,25,$25M to <$50M,Upsell,Blank,Closed Won,Justin Labrum,2025-08-12,2025-06-26,2025-08-12,2025-08-12,2025-08-12,2025-08-12,2025-08-12,2025-08-07,001Vq000005wsrZIAQ

How you doing?
Tom H: Hey, Scott. Good afternoon.
Scott T: Happy Tuesday.
Tom H: Same to you. I'm just writing a little bit of a rube Goldberg machine for finance but not much different than usual. Nice. Yeah, it's one of those, you know, every dollar here goes to these clients, you know, but only in prime number months and only if they're wearing a red hat, and then you need to check the assets, yada, some giant convoluted, you know, jenga tower.
Scott T: They always start with that real simple rule and then they get into like, you know, a 1,000 different exceptions to that one thing that you thought was a rule. Yeah.
Tom H: My only rule so to speak, is don't incentivize people to do bad things, you know, when you're building like commissions plans and allocation methods and stuff like that. We got into a situation where someone was just kind of like brainstorming a commission's plan and, you know, 20 minutes into the conversation, I'm doing the math kind of on my other screen and I'm like this says that it's better for a client to just cancel rather than have them like reduce dollars because, you know, if they cancel, then they're gone once. But if they do the same reduction over the course of the whole term, you'll get penalized multiple times, you know, same thing in sales, right? You got to make sure you're incentivizing people to do stuff that has margin, right?
Scott T: Right. Yeah.
Tom H: That's another problem we ran into once. Is it just the four of us? Or was I supposed to forward this to my team and I didn't I.

Jenna H: Okay, cool.
Tom H: Yeah, that's my mistake. Guys. Jesse should be joining shortly, okay? Okay, cool. Awesome. Liam is coming in just a moment.
Jenna H: All right. He just has to.
Tom H: Get through the zoom screen… the.
Jenna H: Zoom screen of doom. So today, what we really want to do and we talked about it a little bit last time was really kind of talk almost about a… user story session. So if the three of you could walk us through how you use Domo on a day to day basis, what's really critical for your jobs? What do you feel like is missing? As well as just maybe like a high level overview of what tasks you do daily, that are outside of Domo. Because our goal here is to find supplemental use cases for the adoption engine program to kind of go alongside our focus on consumption and credit optimization and instance management. So we want to kind of see what helpful… opportunities things we can find. And maybe it's a new feature that you weren't aware of or maybe it's some lofty aspiration you've always had like tucked in the back of your head and dreamed about like one day I'll do this and rule the world. We kind of want to, you know, get to the bottom of that stuff.
Tom H: Yeah, sure. So, Jenna, I don't know if you guys have like questions already in mind or if you just want to open the floor.
Jenna H: I am all about opening the floor and whoever wants to start. And like I said, kind of, your day to day tasks, if there's any type of like regularly scheduled reporting cadence, like if you every week have to put together these reports or distribute these reports or monthly quarterly, anything like that. And then Scott and I may or definitely will, I guess should say interject with questions maybe a little bit more in detail about the processes but it's not really super structured. It's more just kind of a conversation and see where it takes us today.
Tom H: Sure. I'll go ahead and I guess I'll start. So in terms of day to day, I'm in Domo 95 percent of the time and if I'm not in Domo, it's because I'm in another software tool and I'm probably trying to find data so I can get it into Domo and see, you know, what values it takes, check to make sure that my like front end labels match the API labels that I'm looking at. I don't do very much that is completely outside of the platform. Some of the, I guess main groups of tasks that I would manage would be intake of new projects, scoping calls, requirements, gathering kind of timelining, general project management stuff as well as a pretty decent size of actually getting in the trenches. So there's like a term for it. I forget what it is, but I'm not one of those managers that kind of just like sits above the day to day. I'm in there, I'm writing code, I'm doing card creation, I'm building reports, I'm adding people to groups, all that normal stuff. I think that one of my biggest pain points is… not having a I'm, trying to think what's the right way to say this… way to guarantee that everything kind of displays… the data that it should. And I'm thinking Jesse of when we were looking at the… client profitability stuff a couple weeks ago, and I realized that all of a sudden my revenue values in total don't tie back to our master accounting repositories. Typically that wouldn't be something that I would worry about because it's something I built so so long ago, right? And I would expect that you flip the switch, the light turns on. But I don't really have a way to guarantee that without going in and inspecting to make sure that two plus two equals four in all the places that I want it to. I think that also there's difficulty… with making sure that the right people are getting to the right places because the instance has grown so much over. I mean, we're at like a decade now. So there's lots of situations where, you know, I'm trying to make sure you know, okay people are getting routed to this page, people are getting routed to this dataset, people are getting routed to this calculation. And similar to what I was saying on data integrity, there's also a second level of that is around making sure that data… points that should reflect the same thing, do reflect the same thing because as the organization has grown, and bunches of different people have gotten the keys. We've… got situations where, you know, let's say that all of us in the grou",Consumption Pricing Model,250160.05,Corporate,GREENWAYHEALTH.COM,11,Retail,1310,$250M to <$500M,Renewal,Blank,2: Determine Needs,Rob Staples,2026-01-01,2024-01-11,2024-01-11,,,,,,0015000000vr9eVAAQ

Hi, shailaja.
Shailaja G: Hi, Scott. Good.
Scott B: To see you. How are you? Doing? Good to see you too. I've got to put on my glasses. I'm getting old you.
Shailaja G: All need glasses.
Scott B: Right. Yeah. How have you been? It's been a minute since we've been able to connect.
Shailaja G: I know I was in India, then I went to our office, so that has been a little bit hectic. But, yeah, back in salt lake city.
Scott B: Yeah, good. I'll probably be in Denver in two weeks in.
Shailaja G: two weeks again,
Scott B: Huh, I think so. Okay, probably the days of, I'm… looking at probably the… nineteenth, either the eighteenth, nineteenth or twentieth of August.
Shailaja G: Okay. So, we do have Chris ketterman who you will meet, who you meet, you have met, right?
Scott B: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Shailaja G: Yeah, he's there in Denver and Alyssa, those two team members. And, yeah, if you're planning to kind of visit the team and the office over there. Yeah, I'm happy to.
Scott B: Are you, are you in, you're? Not in Denver?
Shailaja G: No, I'm in salt lake city. I,
Scott B: didn't I thought you were in Denver… so, do, are you remote then? Oh, I didn't know that. I don't know why I thought you were in Denver. Yeah. Okay. Well, cool. I'm in, I live in Logan. Did I tell you that?
Shailaja G: Yes, yes, I know. Yeah.
Scott B: Yeah, yeah. Yeah. I, okay. Well, I'll let you know for sure when we kind of figure that out, but, okay, I think it's pretty certain that it's going to be one of those days that I'll be able to get out to the office. I'm meeting with another customer. We're doing some custom app stuff.
Shailaja G: Okay.
Scott B: So, so,
Shailaja G: do you anticipate to travel another time other than August?
Scott B: I mean, I can travel pretty much anytime I need to, like, I just need heads usually two weeks, they like us to book it two weeks out, yeah, for pricing for flights and stuff after that, it gets kind of more expensive.
Shailaja G: Yeah, right. Right. So, yeah. I may travel to Denver, boulder. I mean, we are in boulder, right?
Scott B: Right.
Shailaja G: Yeah. So I may travel to Denver, maybe… September, October. Okay. So, if you happen to travel that time, then we can connect in office over there.
Scott B: I probably will because I have enough going on with some of the accounts there that it's going to require me to be there. Okay. So we're building and then,
Shailaja G: maybe we can align. Yeah.
Scott B: Yeah, yeah. Okay. Because essentially, what we're doing is here, I'll show you, I think you'll find this interesting. So we're building an app for them. They have a problem with their invoicing, where they're not able to capture everything… that they want. So, we're building out an app.
Shailaja G: Is this for their accounting team too?
Scott B: It's yeah, it's for their accounting team. So there's two issues they do. They're a shipping fulfillment company, and so they have several different systems that will take orders and it creates the invoice, but they don't have one system that brings it all together. And so currently, what they're doing is they're using the invoices and they're manually entering into their database, what sold the price that it was sold at? And they want to automate it. So we're building them an app that allows them to upload an invoice. It then runs it.
Shailaja G: Wow.
Scott B: Yep. It runs a workflow. It uses AI, and it will scrape the invoice, and then add the data to an editable field that they can do QA with. They can assign it to somebody if they want to somebody on their team to review it. And then once they approve, it writes back to postgres, which is the database that we're using. And then it will email the invoice to the customer at the same time. So we're using AI to automate.
Shailaja G: It, look at that. Yeah… I would like to see this, yeah.
Scott B: It's really cool. And I mean, we're doing it with AI prompts and there's an agent within workflows that's called image to text. So we're able to, with a prompt, tell it what to scrape from the invoice.
Shailaja G: Wow. Okay.
Scott B: Yeah. So that's what we're working on with that company and they're based in Denver, which is why, you know, we're going back and forth as we continue to, we're doing some feasibility testing right now, just to make sure that we can do all of it. I'm pretty sure we can. But yeah, it's pretty interesting.
Shailaja G: Awesome. Yeah.
Scott B: So, anyway, that's why I'm going back.
Shailaja G: And forth so much. I would use it. Yeah, no, I can. Yeah, our accounting team is no different, so.
Scott B: Oh, are they having the same problems?
Shailaja G: No, remember, we were building that app for them, Scott was building. I mean, it's a similar use case Varen, but this is for one step after that process of invoice, po, matching, this is one the app we were building was to do the accrual process.
Scott B: Right. So they can like,
Shailaja G: account?
Scott B: For hours utilized and that kind of stuff.
Shailaja G: Right. Yes, yes. Right. Yeah.
Scott B: Right. Yeah. So, I mean, it's pretty interesting and a lot of people don't even know that like Domo has the ability to do this custom apps and image to text. So that's kind of.
Shailaja G: Where we're going with it. Yeah, I have to explore the AI. Is that a tile within the workflow builder?
Scott B: It's yeah, it's a task within workflows. Workflow.
Shailaja G: Okay.
Scott B: Yeah. Let me show it to you. So there's a couple of them.
Shailaja G: And indeed, I had, like I mentioned in my email, I was, I love workflow builder by the way. Just a fact. Oh, good. Just that there were a few hiccups, and, yeah.
Scott B: Yeah. Like the size, I saw that. Yeah, I was, I took a motorcycle trip around Montana… Wyoming… Washington, Idaho and I got back last night. So I've been kind of out of pocket my emails. I'm super backlogged on my emails. But so this one, yeah, in this process here… so this is a different one, but it uses that image to text. And so you can see image… to text.

Bellamy will pull in Paylocity data for termination reasons, which will inform both the TA and HR dashboards, while Benjamin will address the Sankey chart and map issues before their next meeting on Friday.
","Benjamin P: amen, hey, bell. How are you? Good? How are you? I'm doing well. Yeah, doing good. I wanted to show… you something, so. Hey.
Bellamy Y: Ben. Sorry, I think you're cutting in and out, give me two seconds. I'm going to try to join with a different WI fi okay. Hey, Ben. Can you hear me?
Benjamin P: Yes, I can. Oh.
Bellamy Y: That's much better. Good morning.
Benjamin P: Good morning. I do have to drop at 11. So I'll try to go ahead and move through this. I did make some changes to the map and I wanted to show those changes to you. And I also wanted to show you a couple other things. I did see where you had started working on the Sankey chart. So I didn't spend a lot of time with that because I didn't know, you know, how much of this was complete and how much of it you still wanted me to look at. So I was hoping we could dive into that for a couple minutes for sure. On the map side, I did go ahead and was able to set these to like this is like the default now. And so if you like this as the default list, then we'll keep it this way otherwise we can change it. I added in an extra layer. So if users come in here like these are collections of points, which is why they're bars. And so I can't like show an address when you hover over the bar because the bar is a collection of addresses, right? And so there's 136 points here. And so I can't show 136 addresses in just one little tooltip. And so what I've done is I've added two layers. So there's the bars. If the users want to see the actual points, then they can hide this layer. And then on the actual points themselves, you can see it has the address in addition to the decision and the discipline and the hospital that we talked about. So some of these don't have values. Actually, most of these don't have values for the discipline column. It just wasn't available in the data. And so, some of these, you won't see a value, but you see that most of them do have a hospital and they have a, and they have a decision. One thing I tried to do and for some reason it wasn't doing it was, I wanted to color the points by decision so that they would look like this so that you could see, you know, which ones were, which ones were declined and which ones were placed elsewhere and which ones were, it's obviously easy to go over here and make that, but I was trying to set that as a default and for some reason it wasn't, you can see all of these over here were declined. Ah, huh.
Bellamy Y: So the color isn't working perfectly, but it's kind of working. Is that what you're saying?
Benjamin P: It's this, this color based on, for some reason, it wasn't working. And so, I wanted to show you, how I was able, to get the configuration, to be like this. What you can do is, if you go in here and if you do decide, that you want these to be a different color or you want to change this configuration, what you can do is you can go in here and, you can change it to however you want it to be, right? And, once you've set all these, how you want them, you Qlik share and you Qlik export map and then you go to Json. All I need is, this Json string. So, if you make changes and want to copy this map config and then just send this to me. I can update the app with this config because that's this is, that config is what pre defines the map like with the bars and the colors and everything like that. And so, oh, I did set, I set these points to be based on this here and with these colors and in the config, it actually has these, but for some reason, it actually, it's not wrecking that. Like when the map renders, even though it is in the config, for some reason, it's not like rendering them. So, I mean, everything else is working perfectly fine. It's just the, it's just the, that second layer. This field here. For some reason, it's not like it's not. Oh.
Bellamy Y: You're saying we need to come back here and then specify this setting every time if we want that, yeah?
Benjamin P: I see. Yeah, if you want that. Now you may not want that it was just an extra thing that I thought would be nice. It would be nice and, I would like, I would like to have it like as the default but I'm not sure why that. I mean, I'm not sure why it's not working because whenever I set it to this, yeah, or when I set it to decision and I go up here and I export map and put Json, you'll see in here. It'll show decision as the color. Yeah… see, it says color field decision, Ordinal, so like it's in here, but, and this is what I put in the app and everything else is working. But for some reason, this one little area is like, it's just not like it's in the config but it's just not, it's not rendering it on the map, but so, I don't know why, but anyway, I thought you'd be excited to see the development here, with the extra layer and with the points that actually show the other fields that we had discussed.
Bellamy Y: Thank you so much. This is really cool. I can't wait to look into the data center and how things are configured. And I'm pretty sure I can start running from here too. Okay? So.
Benjamin P: Thank you. Cool. So, you want to sort of tell me where, you know, what you're able to do here and what additional assistance do you need from me between now and Friday on this?
Bellamy Y: So, I think other like basic KPI cards like number of opportunities per stage is… easy to make from the data sets. This Sankey chart on the left side is the funnel obviously. And I think this is just like the way our stages are configured in lever, but I don't think these are appropriate like one, two, three, four stages. And so I think that's a question that I need to ask my Ta team more than anything. So I think left side is okay. We would just show it to Kevin and go, hey, this is what you currently have. You tell us what you need to fix, what things needs to be fixed on the right side. Though, what I tried to do in the beginning was not like, you know, departmental postings to or applications to stages. Well, I mean, I don't know, I wanted to do like a couple of stages, a couple of verticals to say, left most to be like number of postings group by department, like you see right there.

Michael N: Jesse, is Dan joining us? Do you know or no? No? I'm.
Jesse W: representing Dan?
Michael N: Okay, perfect.
Jesse W: Let's see how I do.
Michael N: So, thanks so much for jumping on. We just wanted to kind of give an update on what we've been doing, what we think we need to do next kind of results. We've been getting and get your feedback, Kyle on how we're doing compared to what you guys have now and we'll just talk through that because.
Jesse W: We really.
Michael N: We want to progress this. So, Jesse, do you want to take the first stab?
Jesse W: At that, sure, I'm going to start at the end of the story, and then I'm going to let David tell you how we got there, right? Because he's actually doing the technical work with Dan, right? So the end of the story is we're now on to a method that we have more confidence in. I think we've tried three methods. David will correct me if I'm wrong. All right. And what we need to do is make sure that we're not missing opportunities for remediation, that your existing capability is good at identifying. All right? Overall, what we're finding is it's finding too much, right? And so the percentage of times that it's right? That there's something to deal with is not as high as it should be, but it errs on the side of conservatism.
Kyle R: Okay. I mean that's you know, I guess a better state than missing a lot of things, right?
David B: Can I clarify that? I think you're talking about the existing one?
Kyle R: Yes, David. Oh, the existing one.
Jesse W: Okay. David, just that's just, I think Kyle gets it, his current okay. And so appreciate it, David. That's exactly what I'm talking about their existing solution. It errs on what we, it's it errs on the side of finding too much, okay and asking you to check too much. And that's because of its approach, the approach that we've gotten on to now which is LM based. Our concern is potentially that it errs on the side of finding too little. All right? That's that's our concern, right? And what we're trying to do to ensure that isn't the case is a methodology called chunking all right, which is what we need to test out over the next two weeks. We think it's around another 60 hours worth of labor for us to finalize the technical elements of the POC, where we stand right now is we think we are, you know, almost comparable near better, right? In some ways but right? But not, but there's this risk. And if we don't mitigate this risk, we don't want to proceed with you. We want to know that we can do that, right? Because finding too little is risky, better to find too much. Okay. And so anyway, that's where we are and we need a couple more weeks. We think, right? It's so that we don't say, hey, let's proceed. We know the benefits of proceeding with us would be we've got an open model. You'll have the you'll understand how we'll do it. Dale will hold us accountable and you'll see the code. You'll see the technique and you'll improve over time because it's a training approach. It's not like from time zero. We're only testing this on a few of your hardest cases that you gave us. We just exercising some prudence and that's the sort of where we are today. And then I'd love David to explain the methods we've tried and why we're there. But any questions about where we are?
Kyle R: No, I don't think so. Thank you.
Jesse W: Okay.
David B: So what we just so you guys understand, I'll state it again just because I'm slow on the uptake, what we're currently doing. The method we're currently using is analogous to what you currently do except the engine behind it is an LLM that's given certain prompting and other information. So we take your file, we take your design and the actual right they're submitted to an agent along with the prompt and then it executes the request in terms of take a look at these. Here's. An example of one again, we're keeping this anonymized Dan's doing it. But here's an example of one that we did where you can see we found 15 differences. The good news is it's not 115. And I'm saying that jokingly, but you guys understand the current method would probably find far more differences than this. And a lot of those we know, a vast majority usually are not issues, which is what causes the delay and the lack of efficiency.

SSC-D8M: Hey, Bryce, do you know if Jeff or anyone else that was planning to join from your side?
Brice W: I think it was just Mike. Okay. I don't think Jeff could make it. I thought we're I thought the goal was to get… Mike up to speed and kind of show him some of the stuff with Domo. So, I don't think I invited Jeff, right?
SSC-D8M: Oh, yeah. Yeah. No worries at all. That's the, that's the main purpose and. On the zoom as well for the team.
Brice W: I'm going to show you a little show.
SSC-D8M: Thank you. I'm matt. Matt, Mike Boyle, nice to meet you. How's it going? Bill? Nice to meet you, hey?
Brice W: I'm Omer.
SSC-D8M: And I remember you were able to, yeah, very good. I don't know where she's going to go. We are good. Yeah.
Brice W: Thank you.
SSC-D8M: All right. Welcome. Yeah. Have you been here ever? You've been here probably many times. I think it's my, fourth time. Yeah, I still can't get the security, right? Yeah.
Brice W: They let you in again? Yeah.
SSC-D8M: Yeah, I don't know what the security is in your building, but I was a little shocked that the guard shack has those big massive wall barriers. Yeah. And once you get parked and in the building, then there's a human being or no, there's an X Ray, then there's a human being, and then there's the revolving doors, and then you're in the building. So, yeah, and the laptop's out of the bag. Yeah. Well, that's the X Ray and maybe you'll notice you'll see drones flying around.
Brice W: Really?
SSC-D8M: So, security is testing drones. So they're doing perimeter security using drones. It's a test. Sounds like trade secrets. We.
Brice W: don't know.
SSC-D8M: I don't know either. Is it?
Brice W: The nvidia data center or something?
SSC-D8M: Right. Exactly. So I'm saying cyber's going to take over my note taking. But anyway, yeah, welcome. Yeah… it's been good. Yeah, our second onsite of the day. So that's always a good day. We have one with one digital, one digital there at their offices which is actually like eight minutes from here. So that worked out really well. But yeah, always love to meet in person especially for something like this. I realize that you've been, we've hit you with a lot of contacts and two calls. So, I think in person, it feels like it's always a good day. Yeah. And then let's just keep doing it because I'm here to be supportive and if there's value to be had, I need to be on board with that and move it forward. And if there's not, then I need to be giving you feedback and make sure that we're all on the same page. So that's kind of the spirit of why I was super interested in having you here. You threw out some dates that I've internally done some checks and yeah, we're for sure. Not on track for those dates that you threw out. Yeah, bit of work. Yeah. But, you know, let's keep the conversation going and, you know, see where we get out. So, yeah, absolutely. It's, our thought and I really do you have a hard stop and in 50 minutes, I can go, I can go a little bit longer than four o'clock but not much longer. Okay. Yes, I just pushed back all the things. I was, yeah, and sorry about my time, but I can't believe I didn't know. But thanks for being. Yeah. And that's my fault is Bryce is not there somewhere. Yeah, Bryce is on a, right? So you only put, the invite change was, I think just for 30 minutes. Not that that's a problem. We can do it. Okay. But yeah, this plan was to go now, right? Yeah. Okay. Yes. Okay. So… yeah, lots of packing. But our thought was we can start with a little bit more of a Domo overview, just to give you a what is Domo? As we're going through the context of, what is the platform we'll talk about, you know, the other use cases, right? With Katie's, team. And also like with the phase one project that we've been working on with the, and I have not met you that Katie was, yeah, was one of the sponsors here internally. I've not met with her yet. I've not reached out yet. Yeah, there was another piece of homework I took. From the last meeting and I don't remember what that was. But I think the big one that I mean, we want to talk a little bit about, if we have time today is more of the PLM project as well. So we'd love some clarity on, you know, what's Domo's role in the PLM initiative.

Jenna H: Hi, Dave. How are you?
Dave A: Good morning.
Jenna H: Good morning. Ah, it's only nine 30 in your neck of the woods.
Dave A: Yeah. Where are you from?
Jenna H: I'm in North Carolina.
Dave A: Oh, you are?
Jenna H: Cool. Yeah, originally, from… I grew up in new england, so, originally like Maine, but I've lived in North Carolina for the past nine years. So, right outside of chapel hill, oh, cool. Yeah, that's fun. But I'm actually headed out to Utah in like a week and a half to visit some friends.
Dave A: Oh, that's cool.
Jenna H: Yeah.
Dave A: And my, my uncle lives right there too, so.
Jenna H: In North Carolina, right?
Dave A: Outside chapel hill, yeah. Oh.
Jenna H: Where.
Dave A: I don't know. I've been there once, yeah, but yeah, he's he went to IBM.
Jenna H: Okay. Yeah, he's I'm guessing, probably, like a Raleigh or a Cary or something along those lines. Yeah.
Dave A: Yeah, he worked for Hewlett Packard, and then he like helped invent like the fingerprint scanner on the computer. Oh,
Jenna H: that's cool. Yeah.
Dave A: Yeah, fun. He's my smart uncle. So, wow… the more I look at this, the more I get a headache, but let's dive into it, shall we?
Jenna H: Let's do it do?
Dave A: You have recommendations before we dive into this?
Jenna H: So looking at your instance and I went in and I looked at a lot of the domostats datasets to just kind of see some… because it's this is almost like two different use cases. I think that are going to get like merged into one in a way. One is looking at really some dashboard optimization… dashboard and instance optimization. So, you know, consolidating, standardizing, enhancing visuals and things like that. But then on the flip side, there's also an element I think of governance best practices that need to happen alongside of this. So we're talking like everything from content sharing and the ways to do, that are not big lifts like group management to, you know, certified datasets, like we talked about where, you know, your margin's looking two percent different based on what page you're looking at. So there's a lot of elements… here and that's totally to be expected from an instance that's as mature as yours is, right? It's been around for a minute and it's had a lot of different hands involved in it. So I think the best place to start for me to draft up a plan is if you can kind of walk me just through your thoughts and like how you as a user find the Domo experience and navigating around and what features of it you do use. And when you're looking at like a page… what do you gravitate towards? What do people ask you for in terms of visualizations? Things like that? And then if there's something good, like I'll kind of start pecking in there. But I think the best thing to do is for you to start talking… about how you think the best way to lay this out is, and then I can start working on plan formulation.
Dave A: Yep, perfect. I will dive in. All right. I think that as I look at this, I was trying to figure out the end game and that's it's frustrating to figure out the end game because it's so much in here and to try and put this into a place where there's seven tabs across the top. I'm like, holy cow, will we ever get there? Right? And I'm trying to figure out the buckets of like what we do. One that just came across my mind is, and we can bucketize this anyway, maybe I don't try and steer you one way or the other but just give you some ideas like one would be reporting and have a reporting board. The next one would be planning. So it's like your forecasting and business plans and your kind of work product area. And then selling would be kind of a similar work product where I need to know what inventory I have, what orders I have, that kind of thing. So I'm just trying to figure out like mentally how I break those out. And so as I've I took every board and I printed them all… and then I wrote down notes on everything cause I was like, does it, how much of this is just duplicate and a mess? My desk is a mess now, it was probably too overwhelming but I'm just, I'm trying to figure out like what do I even use all this for? Right? I have a pretty good sense of that of where, okay. I like this board but I just totally missed the objective here, right? So as I look at this… my goal here would be to build out a sales area that I use… excuse me, I've bored myself already that I use but like there's other purposes. So like there's a board meeting that happens every quarter that happens in powerpoint. I love the ambition and the idea of someday having the board report just automatically generated in Domo. We're not there yet, and that's a different environment that we have to rebuild every quarter we'll get there. So let's I think for the scope of this, let's focus on just me and my department and how I use this and that'll keep the scope down. And then we'll go from there, building on. So as I look at this overview here in sales… I would look at my ideal view of this is I want to see by year and by quarter, how we are doing. So if I just go here, I'm sorry, I meant to Qlik on the annual by year and by quarter on how we're doing. So if I Qlik on this and I come here. I want to see how we're doing on the year?
Jenna H: I don't want to interject, can you share your screen with me so I could see what you're looking at? Yeah.
Dave A: Sorry?
Jenna H: That's okay. And I think, you know, it is. When I was looking at your instance, there's I think I counted 14 different departments live… in your instance right now.
Dave A: Yeah.
Jenna H: And so that's a lot of different departments with a lot of different needs. And I do think if we… start with… the intention of making a single stop shop for sales first?
Dave A: Yeah. And,
Jenna H: we can optimize it and standardize it, and then we can start introducing that to other departments in areas of sales Domo, like blackstone's Domo instance to gain their adoption. So, I do think this kind of is a key step… in the right direction. And I think it's like level one of the total use case, right? Like.
Dave A: Yeah. Yep.

They explored different approaches for distributing work among welders, including percentage-based allocation and capping work weeks, and agreed on the need for a warning system to highlight potential assignment issues. The ultimate goal is to automate task assignment in the future, potentially using AI, but the current focus is on building a solid foundation for these enhancements.
","William W: mr. Ted.
Ted S: Hey, will, how you doing?
William W: Couldn't be better, man. Couldn't be better. I'm sure I could if it was Saturday, but.
Ted S: hey, we're only halfway through the week. We're getting there.
William W: This week has dragged, man. It's crazy. Yeah, I.
Ted S: Kept thinking today was for Friday, so that was interesting but.
William W: I thought it was Tuesday man. I had something pop up this morning and something was like, yeah, long story short. I thought it was Tuesday all day and it's dragging. This is going to be a short one simply because I want to make sure that the UI that I'm standing up right now is good. The battle with functionality is what I'm going through, but I'm in like the home stretch. So I'll show you and it's always in here if you ever want to mess with it. But I'll show you what we're looking at. I think you'll be happy with the progress. But again, until I get this functionality completely sound, it's… like the last thing to lock in. So it involved some rewiring in the back end. I had to add another data store where we're storing packet start dates. Oh, cool. We got the whole crew, mr. Tyson. How are you?
Ted S: Well, no, sorry. I just joined again on my computer. So sorry. Oh, that's all right. My computer wasn't syncing properly, so I think I'm just connected twice. Hopefully the audio doesn't get jacked up.
William W: Okay. No worries. Okay. So the short version is I ended up going in here and throwing a storage of packet start date per welder. And now, what we have is this UI and you can see it's kind of doing some funky things which is fine if it's all the way up against the left. We don't want to nudge it left. And so you'll only see this arrow over to the right to nudge.
Ted S: Okay. And.
William W: then you can see it bumps along just fine. And then what I added in there because well, I'll just show you. And then I'll give you the why when we have these days because now that we do have nudging, when we have these days where we're over 100 percent capacity, I wanted to surface that and make sure that you or your supervisors were aware. And the reason being is like if the efficiency for this person shifts and we get spillover calculations, pushing chips into other spots, we kind of need to surface that. And given that this can only go to 100, it's hard to see that.
Ted S: I think it makes sense to at least signal that you have that conflict. What I don't know is then should it just force spill further? So like will week six just gain more lap? Or will it have to actually put that into week seven then, too if there's over 100 percent in that week five timeframe?
William W: Yeah. This is where everything is coming to a head right now is like those exact, really good questions that are a bit philosophical. And the reason why I say that is right now everything is anchored in the start date, not the weld start date, but on the day that we placed on the calendar. So if we take this and I don't think it's going to work because things are broken right now. So let's go with Nathan. Need to fix that. Don't worry about that. Okay? So it's good. So when we assign it because we're not calling out what week to start it on, everything has to default to the first day of whatever week one is. And so you're almost always going to have this overlap and this stacking happening here. And if what we tell it is like, hey go ahead and… change the spillover as a default, then we're rendering a lot of calculations and that's where we were getting that binding up before. So the short version is, can we do it? Absolutely? I think you and I need to make sure that we're completely aligned on like how does that work? And then… agree on the logic basically what's our order of priority. And I think we've talked on this before but ultimately, like what you might have is like you're over qualified individuals or highly skilled is probably a better way to put it. They may end up with more packets than others. And so we may see days where it's like really stacked. And I guess I'll just ask you. Like is your preference? The spillover logic is nuanced. It's like, do we fit a certain amount of hours in there? Do we prioritize?
Ted S: Yeah. So I guess what I'm thinking like the logic of a packet, like calculating what the start and the stop date would be as far as assigning capacity would be, do you have your packet with your demand of total number of hours? And then the distribution between the number of welders is I guess done first. So it's like, okay, I assign two welders to that job. There's 100 hours in the job. And so now each welder has 50 hours assigned to them. Yeah. And that would be like a recorded calculation or table value. And then as you assign it to the welder too, they're gonna have their list of assigned jobs. And when that gets assigned to them, if there's already something that's blocking out the first week, it's gonna default to the first available capacity. And so I guess I might need to map it out before I spell it all out to you there. But the assignment to the welder would basically their first start date would be whenever the final capacity is by default, but we would be able to push that start date by a week capacity just like you have here on the toggle button. So I don't think I'm explaining it any better than what you already have functionally built into the system. But maybe if I play with what's in there, I can work out my thought process there a little better.
William W: It helps, it helps. And then what we need to see what we need to see is when this pushes over this that the spillover like this bar should get larger right now. This bar is like showing. So… 21 percent utilized on this day. Hypothetically, I guess this is only using four… 21. Yeah. So I don't think it's recalculating when the packet stacks. So I think I need to add that one last thing in there which is like when a packet lands on a welder, it defaults to the first available day for capacity. And then the spillover is calculated after that is there, yeah.
Ted S: That's what.

Ankit S: How's your week going?
Bellamy Y: It's going good. I think a lot of new stuff popping up… cool old stuff being… late, yeah.
Benjamin P: How's.
Ankit S: how's Philly? Have you been exploring much?
Bellamy Y: Well… definitely been watching all the sports games because my boyfriend's out of the family's freaking crazy Philly.
Ankit S: Fans are not to play with big Philly?
Bellamy Y: Fans, my God. Yeah… I mean, it's fun. I'm not gonna lie. It's funny. I've never had this obviously like growing up. I grew up as Korean born and raised. So I never really had this kind of sports… craze I guess. And like when I was in college and beyond, it's a, it's something that I've just dabbled… I guess like acted like, I know, I've never really had the opportunity to ask people about things because I didn't want to seem stupid hello.
Benjamin P: But.
Bellamy Y: now that I have a boyfriend, it's like I can and he actually did sports before in college and high school, and he knows like every single freaking rules and he knows every single current events and all that stuff that I can ask him whatever I want. He gets really annoyed, but I still ask, well.
Ankit S: You moved to Philly during a good time. I mean, obviously eagles are riding on a high from last year, yes.
Bellamy Y: Or?
Ankit S: Sorry earlier this year.
Bellamy Y: Yeah… that's right. I bet. Yeah.
Benjamin P: Sorry about, the last minute. My, so Tuesday night, my youngest son decided to get sick and he was up every hour throughout the night. So I got absolutely zero sleep Tuesday night and then I stayed home with him on Wednesday. So, sorry for, the last minute sort of changed there, but I obviously didn't anticipate that. So, and my wife's out of town until she's actually coming back today. And so just me. So normally, she would have stayed with him, but yeah, I was the only one. So, no.
Bellamy Y: Worries at all. Is he? Okay. Yeah.
Benjamin P: Yeah, he's good. You know, he started to feel better Wednesday during the day and then he was, I sent him back to school tomorrow or sent him back to school yesterday and he was fine. And then he was good today. So I think we're at least he's in the clear. I hope we're in the clear. We'll have to sort of wait and see. But, yeah. So, but I did, I have provided you a few email and text updates throughout the week. And so hopefully you're excited about those because I was certainly excited about the progress that we made this week. So how.
Bellamy Y: should we spend our time? So like I think more than by the way we have another meeting scheduled for later. Wait. No, that's still just never mind that's not us, the, how should we spend our time? Should we do the map or should we talk about the dashboard? I.
Benjamin P: Would I actually want to talk about the map, and try, to nail down visually how we would like to display that data? Because there's a ton of different options and I obviously don't want to make the decision for you. And so I would, I'd like for us to kind of go through those options together and try to take a snapshot of how we want it to look. And then I can set those that, I can fix those settings in the code so that when the map renders, it'll default to those settings. And I don't know, I don't think Ankit's seen the map yet. Ankit, this is okay. This is really cool. So be prepared.
Bellamy Y: I, also, as I said Ben, I will, I'm also looking to learn as well because yeah, that talent acquisition parts of the map is actually quite complicated. That's going to require some ETL before we load it up to the map. So I want to learn that and be able to implement myself. But the other ones that you've already visualized like those are like pretty much almost good to go. And maybe you could guide me here on… what to do. I don't know how to expand this.
Benjamin P: So, so go to apps at the top.
Bellamy Y: And.
Benjamin P: then go to talent acquisition, I think is where it's at and then get a mapping.
Bellamy Y: And.
Benjamin P: there it is right there. So, yes, see there, it is perfect. Okay. So there's all of your addresses and the default color, is a little bright. So it's… what we can do is if you go to the left side there and change that layer blending. So scroll down to the bottom and change that layer blending where it says additive, change that to normal and then scroll up. And… then, so instead of point for basic, you see it says point, I think what we want to do is like the hex bin, but there's also the clustering is pretty cool too. So, you know, I don't know which one you prefer, but the clustering is dynamic in that when you zoom in, it breaks out those clusters even further and you can also change the colors if you want the, if you do want to do hex bin and you want the bars to be vertical, like have height to them. There's some additional settings there that you can. Yeah. So, right. Yes. And then you can just Qlik the little scroll bar and you can like, you can like move it up.
Bellamy Y: Yeah. Okay.
Benjamin P: White, the little white square, you can manipulate left to right?
Bellamy Y: Which one? This one? No, this one?
Benjamin P: Yeah. There you go. Yeah. And so like this is what I wanted to like play with and try to figure out, okay, how exactly do we want this to look? Because, I can default everything that you're doing here on the left hand side, I can default in the settings so that when the map pulls up, it'll look like this when it as soon as it pulls up and so.
Bellamy Y: What's geoero?
Benjamin P: I'm not sure.
Bellamy Y: Whoa. Okay. So over here, the heat and when.
Benjamin P: you hover over one of these, you know, sort of these clusters, you know, we can have it display different data. I think right now it just shows the count of the number of data points and,
Bellamy Y: yeah, you.
Benjamin P: Know. I'm wondering.
Bellamy Y: Sorry, I just want to play around with it just a little bit longer. Yeah, no problem. I've used this in my previous job, but in Kepler, so it's crazy how we're doing this right now?
Benjamin P: You've used Kepler before?

The key highlights were the recommendation to use a service account for the integration to better utilize the cache across multiple users, the need to analyze the cost implications of the current approach versus storing the data in the Domo dataset, and the suggestion to adjust the freshness check settings to optimize performance.","Savannah O: good morning, everybody.
Ashanmugasundaram: Hi. Good morning.
Rama K: Good morning, everyone.
Savannah O: Good morning. It's just me from the Domo side today. So let me know when everybody from the ups team is here and we're ready to get started.
Martin T: Hi, Savannah. Hi, everyone. Yeah, I think everybody's here, Savannah. If you want to go ahead, I don't know if you want us to share our screen or how you want to approach it.
Savannah O: Great. Yeah. Whoever is kind of leading on your side, if you want to share your screen and just kind of talk through some of the remaining issue questions that you have. I know that Casey had some answers already. So I think we were mostly talking about the caching and freshness checks today. Is that correct?
Martin T: Yes, that's correct. And.
Ashanmugasundaram: also, we have a question on what is our consumption? Let's Martin complete that one. Then we can discuss about the usage of Domo.
Martin T: All right. I'll share my screen. So here is our integrations that we've done with databricks. I'll go into it, but I think a little bit of background and I think Rama can speak more about it. Is that he was seeing, I think we were just trying to understand how the caching works because we were seeing a lot of requests being sent to our databricks SQL warehouse many… times over. And maybe that's why some of the cards take longer to load. But I think Rama, can you speak more about this as you looked into it?
Rama K: So, yeah. So usually how this detail works in a high level in the Domo side. So let's say if we keep like a two hours of the time to leave it, meaning that around for one, 20 minutes. So in the starting minute, what let's see if I have loaded the full dataset, right? Meaning that the entire data is going to be cached. And there's a full dataset I have loaded without any filter. Okay? So now, after that, if I'm filtering that subset of datasets. So does it not picking the data from the ttl itself? Meaning that it's not picking the data from the cache. So instead what it's doing, it's going to hit every time to the databricks site?
Savannah O: Yeah. So the caching is what we cache, is the card query result. We don't actually cache the entire dataset. So it's the results of the query that the card is sending to databricks. Is what gets cached?
Rama K: Okay. Let's take an example in this manner itself. Let's say I have a filter that applied for one card. Okay? But the same filter, if I'm applying another user, not the main user, another user is applying the same, but still, it is going to hit into the databricks only. But as I'm expecting the other user who is hitting the same code in the same filter that need to be comes from the cache. Is that correct?
Savannah O: Correct. Yeah. If it's the same filter, same sort of query, and this is only for the case where you're not using oauth, are you using oauth?
Ashanmugasundaram: So, in that case, all these dashboards are viewed by the account level, right? So in the same account, so basic, our base filter is in the account id, right? So if it is coming from the same account id, it is going to take it from the cache. And in case of different account, you are saying that it will go for the databricks hit… is that our, we can understand?
Savannah O: No, not necessarily. But are you using the oauth integration with databricks?
Rama K: No, for now, we are not going to set up that one. So we are about to set up the oauth integration. For now, it's happening using the Pat token.
Savannah O: Yeah. Okay. Yeah. So.
Rama K: Does it, does it going to affect anything related to the ttl? If you go for the oauth or Pat? So, is there any specific reason why you are bringing up this question?
Savannah O: Yeah. So if you have oauth, then basically caching is irrelevant because the queries always need to run in the context of the user. So it's not necessarily irrelevant. If the same user loads the same card, you know, the same filters applied within that period of time, then they can pull from cache. But another user who loads the same card with the same filters, it can't pull from that cache because it needs to run in the context of that user specifically, but where you're not using the oauth integration. Currently, yeah, if user a loads the card with filter a applied. And then user B comes and loads that card within the live cache ttl with the same filter a applied, then user B's load should be pulling from cache.
Rama K: Okay. So let me come to the second point but my first point is very interesting here. So let's say an example you're saying while you're using the Pat token, then only the ttl, I mean, the time to value will work for the cache side. So that is where the first statement, right? But here the question, right? So we are going to create the Pat token using the individual credentials. Let's say an example, if I have created a Pat token under my credentials in the Domo, right? So I am pointing that Pat token enter my Domo, refreshing to the databricks side every time I'm hitting to the databricks, it's showing on my name, right? This is not supposed to be correct. Yes.
Savannah O: Yes, yes, it's going to show it as you.
Rama K: Yeah, but this is not supposed to be correct, right? Because this is, we are in the entity organizations, it's not relevant to my personal access token. So, so to work on this one, there is only other option. What we have currently is like auth, right? So that you guys are introduced in the August release for the, I think two months back, right? So if we can utilize that auth authentication using the service principle, then you are saying that the ttl won't work because it's looking for every time to hit the databricks.
Savannah O: The ttl just isn't going to work across the users.
Rama K: But if that is the case, right? So then depending on the individual credentials, it's not recommended a lot, right?
Savannah O: Sorry, say that last part.
Rama K: Again, so if the auth is not working for the cache, so the way we have currently existing using the paat token, but that is not at all recommended, right? Because that is my individual credentials, correct?

Nik K: Hey, Kyle. Good. How about you?
Kyle C: Alright. Thanks. I saw Katie was out, so.
Nik K: Yeah, I wasn't sure if we were having this, but I guess Justin was out last week, so.
Kyle C: Was he?
Nik K: I guess you are fair enough.
Kyle C: Hey, Tim.
Tim K: Hello. How you doing?
Kyle C: Doing alright. How about you? Oh, good. Yeah, good.
Tim K: Check email and see what you can do. Nick, we had like a great start with both fidelity and telus, and then they're we… use the expression and I don't think this recording will go to the client. You know, they say discovery is dragging them through glass… right? It's a step. You have to do with your client. Yeah, you know, to better understand what they really want and you have to ask a lot of questions. The client's version of dragging us through glass is when they just, you know, go dark for weeks at a time. Oh.
Nik K: Yeah, yeah.
Tim K: Kyle, how are things going in the support group?
Kyle C: Going good. A lot of new faces, a lot of new faces… and a lot of new opportunities. It's going well. I'd say.
Tim K: What do you mean? New opportunities?
Kyle C: Just different roles opening up?
Justin Z: A couple.
Kyle C: Roles in escalation, a couple of the newer roles they created that are more like a more like a TSM type role. Yeah.
Tim K: Yeah, that's good. Yeah, it's all about adoption.
Kyle C: Yeah. Yep. Exciting… agent.
Tim K: Hey, Justin.
Justin Z: How we doing?
Tim K: Hey, good. How are you?
Justin Z: Pretty good.
Tim K: Oh, yeah. Good to hear how's we're into the dog days of August.
Justin Z: We are, yep, summer is what half over for the kids. So, yep.
Kyle C: Only half over.
Tim K: Yeah, northeast is later than most of the rest of the country. Yeah, I'm not too sure about Canada.
Kyle C: I think I remember that when I lived up in New Jersey but yeah, I think the kids just started school back this maybe this week or next week down here.
Tim K: Wow, that's earlier than I thought.
Kyle C: Yeah.
Tim K: Yeah, it's like second week or so of August, but yeah, no, it's good. Justin, you're experiencing, we're getting some of the best new england weather. You're ever going to get… it's like that September, cool, September humidity and, you know, you got September still in front of you, which is a good thing. So, I know Justin, hopefully you're finding a golf course or something like.
Justin Z: That, that's always my plan. It doesn't always work out as well as I hope, but yeah, I've played a few rounds. Yeah, I've been shut out.
Tim K: Yeah, yeah. I did in may and then I, I'll pick it up though and take some time off in August and play it out a few times. So, I think I'm not sure. I didn't get an email from Katie, but I know she typically one. I think one we just want to hit any support issues. I know you guys had a couple topics last week or two weeks ago, is anything going on that front?
Justin Z: Yeah. The only, the only thing I had obviously with Katie out is Nick was trying to get access to the instance, I was out of the office half able to do anything. And then I was just trying to basically say, pretty, please figure this out with Ryan because I know Ryan figured it out somehow without me having to do anything, but I'm not sure that actually happened. So if it hasn't today's the day, I'm just going to reset Nick's, password, and we'll call it, we'll call it a day. And if audit comes looking for me, whatever it is, what it is. So, how we looking Nick?
Nik K: Yeah. If you could please reset the password, I'm still not in so.
Justin Z: All right. Yeah. Cause the next step there was starting to really look at the actual fidelity stuff with the real stuff. So, let me do this real time and see if it can work for us. So, I think I just have to change your password and then you can use that link, right?
Nik K: Yes.
Justin Z: Okay. I'm getting a configure authenticator… message.
Nik K: Oh, yeah. There's enhanced security. If you're resetting someone's password, then you need to do two factor auth… do you have like an authenticator app installed on your phone, you could use?
Justin Z: I do. So, even the admin of the instance gets… yep? All right. While I'm struggling around here with this, anything else that we had on the agenda or was that really the only thing that we all had?
Nik K: Yeah.
Tim K: Go ahead. Nick, stay on that, but I'm not, we wanted to show you the update like I think you asked about mobile and, you know, like we're kind of, you know, we're at the ready, but it's a matter of what… you know, we need your feedback. So that was the primary topic was just digging in on that what we have.
Justin Z: A little more.
Tim K: And Justin almost like if Nick was in the instance and you had a magic wand, you know, we might want to look at the review, look at the update again. But if he was, and he had a magic wand, you know, what would be… game changing again in kind of level that's the topic.
Justin Z: Got it. All right. So, let's see here… authenticators configured… six digit code. We might be in business. Let's see. All right. Well, I've hit verify three times and gotten nowhere… try that again. Do I want to use the fidelity password code or the Domo password code? When I'm putting in my one, the six digit verification, anybody know?
Tim K: It.
Nik K: should have given you a QR Code or something, right? To create the code first?
Justin Z: It gave me a QR Code. I scanned that. It added Domo to my phone inauthenticator. And then when I went into Domo, it gave me a one time password code or whatever. And I put that code in and did nothing. So, then I just tried the fidelity one. That one didn't work either. So, if this doesn't work, I'm going to give up for now and we'll figure it out later again, which is sad, but yeah, I hit verify a third time and it didn't let me do it. I don't know what's going on. All right. So we can do the mobile?
Kyle C: I'm going to check online and see what might be going on here in a second.
Justin Z: Yeah.
Nik K: Justin, did you have a chance to look at the video we sent over with the recording on the iPad and the mobile?

James L: Oh, really?
Benjamin P: It was very hot. I've been to salt lake city like six times and oddly enough, every time I've been, it was in the winter and so, I didn't even know it got hot there, but it was very, I mean, it's not as humid as it is in Georgia. I mean, there was like zero percent humidity, but it was like 96, one day.
Madison H: Yeah, it gets, I grew up in Utah, so, it definitely, it's surprising because you don't think it gets hot but it is a high desert, so it's definitely a little shocking.
Benjamin P: But I mean, having grown up in Utah.
James L: Well, having grown up in Utah myself, but living in Arizona for the last 15 years, I can say Utah never gets hot.
Benjamin P: Yeah. You guys just staring at?
James L: Arizona, it is beautiful.
Madison H: Yeah. Arizona, you guys are a little bit different and that heat's a, you know, that's not something. My dad went to mountain view high school and like my whole family grew up in Arizona. So we, that heat is not for me. I could never live in Arizona.

He had left at one point and just came back. So I will, you know, get you introduced when he has the free time and when we're able to reconnect again. But everyone you see on the call today is to help drive for that adoption opportunity that I emailed you about. And so I did want to give them a chance to introduce themselves kind of what their role is. And then we can jump in and kind of chat a little bit more about what that looks like.
James L: Yeah, that'd be great.
Madison H: Perfect. I don't know if you also want to introduce yourself to them so that they have an understanding of kind of your role and what you do, maybe have you start off and then we'll kick it over to Ben.
James L: Sure. Yeah, both Molly and I, but I guess I could let her introduce herself but I'm James, of course, I work at. Reese's dental is a somewhat large dso or dental service organization. Basically, we're a large dentist company. We have about 100 dentists or so 27 offices in four or five different states and I'm the director of analytics. Molly is kind of my right hand person that is amazing. She carries the workload. She carries the smart, the good stuff. She does a lot with Domo. Yeah.
Molly B: James is the face and I'm the one that gets the stuff done.

James L: Yep. Okay, cool.
Madison H: Sorry, Molly. I haven't had a chance to meet you yet. I am your guys' customer success manager. So really you're kind of your quarterback here at Domo, but it's nice to meet you.
Molly B: Yeah, good to meet you. Yeah, I've heard your name thrown around a few times. So it's nice to put a name to the voice.
James L: Wonderful.
Madison H: I bet, I don't know if you want to.
Benjamin P: Yeah. Yep. So I'm a senior consultant here at Domo. I've been here for going… on two years. I was a customer for seven years before coming to Domo. I started my career in finance and moved into analytics. I've done most of my responsibility since I've been here, has been working with customers like you building technical solutions. So primarily on the backend side of things, doing data flows, data connections… I've done a lot of custom apps inside of Domo for customers who opt for a more custom solution. So if there's ever a need there that's something that I've got a lot of experience with. So just looking forward to learning more about how you're using the platform and looking forward to working with you and helping build out and help you expand on the capabilities and the ways that you're using the platform.

How's it going?
Nate T: Simon? Doing well. How are you?
Simon N: I'm pretty good. Busy morning. It's my fourth one in a row here. So we're chugging along.
Nate T: Well, that sounds awesome.
Simon N: Yeah, makes the day go by quick. What's new with you kids back in school? A little more free time? How are things looking?
Nate T: Yeah, kids back in school, it's a little bit quieter around the house, but I still have the two young ones, the one year old and the three year old. So in here, I'm messing around playing, getting upset, all that stuff.
Simon N: Have you been able to get out biking at all recently?
Nate T: My daughter does mountain biking league and so she's had some races. We went to a race last week that it's like a couple hour drive. So we went and spent the night just like at a hotel and she had an early race. So I guess I've been participating like I've been watching her. I haven't been riding that much.
Simon N: You need to bring your bike and go spectate the course or actually I don't know how long is like a youth bike race?
Nate T: It depends on the age. So hers are pretty short. They range from like anywhere from like five to seven Miles. So depending on the terrain and stuff, I think her first one took about 45 minutes. The last one was like 35 minutes. So it's yeah, it's pretty quick but they're pretty, they lock it down as far as who can ride. So it's unfortunately, I don't get a ride without… being, I guess a more active participant in like the ride, I can become a coach if I want to, but I think I will next year, but I didn't do it this year.
Simon N: Maybe get out there a day early or show up super early, get the course recon, do a lap or something. Yeah. Is it like fairly like rolling like kind of cross country trails or I don't really know anything about mountain bike racing?
Nate T: Yeah, this, the kids or it's like a youth program that goes through junior highs and high schools. And so it's designed to be cross country. They don't really have jumps or anything. But, yeah, it's… pretty smooth rolling. And like in… the first race, it was really uphill, I mean, and, it was a bit more rocky. There was a lot of more elevation change in this last one. They had some elevation change but it was like in one section for the most part is pretty rolling. And then in this last one, the downhill was like a pretty steep section in just one area. And so for the most part, it's pretty mild relatively speaking.
Simon N: Oh, that's cool. I like, I don't know when, like, when you were growing up, was that an option? Like you remember hearing about like friends doing mountain bike racing? Like it seems such like a cool thing to do as a kid, but I was just like, that was never an option. I was like obviously the way I remember it.
Nate T: Yeah, it's definitely caught on and it's not an inexpensive sport. I mean, like I've got a pretty decent bike and some of the kids that are racing like their bikes are like 10, 15,000 dollar bikes wow.
Simon N: My gosh.
Nate T: I mean, you don't need that type. Like my daughter's bike is like 800 a 1,000. Like I wanted her to have something that would do the job. But, like I didn't want to go crazy on the bike like initially and, you know, she really gets into it and like develops and we'll upgrade her, but, yeah… and so it's a, I guess it's kind of an affluent, yeah, it's an affluent sport and like the overall maintenance, like even like the simple stuff like how do I get her there? It's like I've got to have, you know, something that can like, we've got to have a car that has, you know, something we can put like, what am I trying to say?
Simon N: Like a bike rack?
Nate T: Yeah, a bike rack, a carrier and so like generally hitch carriers are the best. So it doesn't like mess up your car. So like all that stuff kind of starts to add up. Yep. And like she had a practice Monday and it's like, or she had a practice yesterday and like the pick up and drop off because there's like a, you know, it's like a 25 minute drive and then you drop them off and it's like, do I stick around for two hours? Do I leave? Like, what do I do? So I'll be, I'm like I like to watch her participate and have a good time and like she's had a really good time with her like meeting new friends, but I'm also like, alright, I think the season is, can be winding down like the next race is like in a week and a half and it's like a three hour drive away. So, oh, wow. So same thing. We'll leave Friday, spend the night and then kind of make a little date out of it a little like daddy daughter like getaway. So it'll be, it's fun. Well.
Simon N: That's, hopefully it's, some lasting memories but, yeah, that's a big commitment. I mean, full weekend and, yeah, that's bikes though, right? They're, my bike's in the shop right now and it's always like something and right? You can always make it a little bit nicer but it's funny. I was like kind of complaining to the Guy at the bike shop because I brought my bike and he goes, oh, no, I didn't want to see you again so quickly. So, I just brought it in recently and we were going back and forth and I was like, oh, you know, like my bike, you know, it's a little bit old, such pilots in here more and he said, you know, what? The best bike is, the best bike you can own is the bike that you ride, and he's like the fact that you're out riding and that stuff's yeah, going wrong, but that's the best bike, the one that you're actually out using?
Nate T: Yeah. I, sometimes I think it's more frustrating. Like when I've upgraded bikes. I'm like this bike is a 5,000 dollar bike. I've been riding it for like four weeks like it shouldn't be squeaking and like squeaking is really normal on bikes. But I'm like it bothers me, you know, when I'm riding it and also I just paid a lot of money for it and like yep. And so, I think I'm a bit more critical like on some of the like the nicer or the bikes that I bought that are nicer. I'm like come on, it's paid a lot of money for this. I shouldn't have to be like fixing it and doing all this stuff, but it's there's no way around it.

Michael N: It's a friend's birthday party. So we rented out like a whole bunch of cabins on the beach in point Reyes, California. So it should be fun.

Karl A: Hey, good morning.
Michael N: So, Carl, I canceled the meeting after this because Dale's booked up with a bunch of other projects. So, if there's anything you wanted to discuss on that was for the next meeting, we could talk on this one also or after.
Karl A: Yeah, sounds good.
Michael N: Are we waiting for Brendan, Tracy… Matthew? Do you know if they're coming?
Karl A: I'm not sure if, they come, if they don't you know, they don't.
Michael N: okay. And we don't have Tiva, yet. She didn't send me a notice that she wasn't able to make it, but I know it's been a little bit crazy. Let's see. Excellent. There's, Tiva. So why don't, we get started? Carl? Let's start with, Tiva, any updates for the team?
Tivakanoa S: Yes, I have two updates. One is for, Kevin, there's an endpoint that I posted to the case that should help run the workflow as needed. And the engineering stated that they can jump in if needed. So just go ahead and take a look at that and let me know your thoughts on it.
Kevin M: Okay. Yeah. I saw that the part about the odyssey resource that's something on engineering side, right there's, nothing we need to do that.
Tivakanoa S: Let me recheck, but yeah, I think they can just jump in and fix it if needed. But yeah, I can check with them. I don't think it's the odyssey resource. Yeah, I'll have them take a look at that part if it's needed on their end or if you need to do it.
Kevin M: Okay. Yeah, we'll try the endpoint as well.
Tivakanoa S: Okay. And then Carl… were you able to check on the upstream data for the Json parsing error? You're muted if you're talking.
Karl A: I was talking. Thank you. Yes. Yeah, you can. We're just going to kill the connector so you can just, we can just close the ticket.
Tivakanoa S: Okay. Other than that, I do have an update or Dale's ticket is still being reviewed. They're just trying to reproduce it on their end. But other than that, yeah, that's all the updates I have for.
Michael N: Which ticket was that? Tiva?
Tivakanoa S: Dale's one?
Michael N: What was it regarding?
Tivakanoa S: The task queue sending emails even though the notifications have been toggled.
Michael N: Off. Oh, got it. Yeah.
Tivakanoa S: That one. It's with engineering. They are actively looking into it. They're just having trouble with like being able to reproduce what Dale's been doing, so.
Michael N: Got it. I'll update him. I'll let him know.
Tivakanoa S: Okay. Thank you.
Michael N: You got it. Should we go to let's go to Sabrina?
Sabrina P: Hello. How are y'all.
Michael N: good. How's it going?
Sabrina P: Good. I just have one question. I was wondering, are the omnicon calls going to start merging soon now that everything's finalized?
Michael N: My understanding is it's not finalized yet? It's supposed to be by the end of the year. I think there's still two outs. I saw an omnicon press release on Tuesday, maybe that said that Mexico and the eu still have to give the thumbs up on it. My hope is because I know Dana has been meeting with the omnicon team. I think on a daily basis that somewhere along the line, we're going to get the flag that, yes, we can start merging things and then we'll work with Dale and whoever is in charge, my guess is Cleve over on the omnicon side and start pulling stuff together. Did you get an indication Sabrina when the email addresses were going to flip over?
Sabrina P: I think the last person who was on this call, I can't remember her name, so sorry, but she, yeah, I think she said that it was November first.
Michael N: Okay. But,
Sabrina P: I don't I'm not entirely sure. I don't have any confirmation from anyone yet, either.
Karl A: Yeah, I know Dale about that, like last week and he said it wasn't confirmed.
Michael N: Yeah. Okay. Yeah. As soon as we get called, Carl will probably be the first one to reach out to us and let us know. We're good to start doing some things but we should, Carl, should we start sitting down me, you, Joe Dale and coming up with a like a roadmap of activities that need to happen? Yeah, just so we can prepare and make sure that we have a team to fill in any gaps that you guys have on your side.
Karl A: Yeah, that's a good idea.
Michael N: It gets kind of hairy when those things come through.
Karl A: Sure. I mean, I guess there's probably a lot to think about especially if the domain is going to change for some reason.
Michael N: Yeah. And Joe, what's the process? If we had to change the domain over to like omnicom health, everything over, can we change names or is that a big deal?
Joe P: Yeah, we can change names, whether it's a big deal or not depends on what types of connections there are to that instance, because things like apis break published jobs need to be updated. So, but there's a pretty extensive list that support will send over of all the impacted things and we can just go through them one by one and then actually changing the instance name is relatively straightforward. You pick a time we change it. It takes about 15 minutes and it propagates across.
Michael N: Awesome.
Joe P: Yeah.
Michael N: We just got to make sure we check all those boxes beforehand.
Joe P: Yeah, because there's no going back right? Once we change it. So, yeah, you definitely want to have a nice robust change management process around it.
Michael N: Yeah. So when we get a little bit closer, Carl, let's sit down and have a strategy session with that. Maybe we can come to New York and do it.

Shane W: They actually, they put one in Utah a few years ago and it was here for a little while then went away and then came back as like a food truck, but I haven't tried it. I don't know why it's I think it tastes better on the east coast because of the humidity. I don't know, I don't know why, but it tastes, it was really good. It wasn't quite as good here when I had it.
Ankit S: That's funny. Yeah, I used to go as a kid all the time and, yeah, there's still plenty around on the east coast. Yeah, it'll never go away.
Shane W: Well, good. Well, I guess from Stephen F, Austin's side, is there anybody else who's going to be jumping on? Or is it just?
Ankit S: Yeah, not sure if Linh's going to be joining? Yeah, I'm not sure if we'll have anyone else or not.
Shane W: Okay. Well, I think what I wanted to do was just kind of walk through where we're at with the project of doing the invoicing or taking invoices and creating ap journal entries with them. And then I want to also get… maybe get your approval, David to kind of expand the scope of what I'm working on and increase… the number of invoices I have so that we can do some training on the models to help them be more efficient in their creation of the journal… entries. But so just to kind of give you a little background here, you know, one of the things we wanted to work on was helping to increase the efficiency of the invoice creation… like bringing that and putting it into the accounts payable. And so we talked about building out the using AI to kind of generate the ap entries. And so I wanted to show you what we've created so far and where we're going. And then what we need to kind of continue that process. So let me open it up and I've been building this out in a test instance that I have so… that we can kind of just get things so that we're not building… it out in your production instance. So let's see here. Let me share my screen and we'll kind of dive into it. And David, is that, is there anything I guess before we jump into that? Is there anything that you guys are working on? That? Any questions that you guys have that might be able to answer?
Ankit S: I don't have any. I don't know if Michelle or Sabrina might.
Shane W: Let's see here. Sorry, this is a test instance that I have, and it's a little bit messy because I just throw stuff in here and it's just for building out things and testing things. One of the things we're the way we're kind of envisioning this working is… creating a app that will allow… us to load? Let's see, do I have it… allow us to like load those invoices into Domo? I apologize. I'm I've kind of a little bit scatterbrained this morning? Let's just look at this. So, this is, the design we're building out and it's right now, it's pretty basic. We'll we'll add more functionality, but it's kind of proving out here what we're doing. So what we do is we take a file and we can choose, you know, any of these invoices and. and what it does is it loads it into our system and… puts it into a file directory. And then we have a workflow that in the background kicks off and processes that invoice and creates… it looks at the invoice looks at, all the lines. It creates what we call a Json which is basically unstructured data of that invoice. So including like some of, the header data… and the name of the company. So like here, here's an example of it, this is it takes that invoice processes it. And then it creates a data set that has, the name of, the vendor, the details of the invoice, the po, of the invoice, total. So this is just all overview information about the invoice. And then we also get the line level detail of each line that's associated, with that. And so, so it takes that invoice looks at it. And then creates this list, of each line item and an overview of it. So now we have all the detail and then we're able to take that and now create, the entries into that will that can be posted into mip. But the thought, is that once it's loaded, we'll be able to go in and look at the invoice. And, and before it gets loaded into mip, we want somebody to actually just like validate, that the information is correct before, we put it into mip. So we'll have you load the invoice, it processes it, and then it will put it into this into a place where we can go in and validate that the information is correct. And again, I apologize this is not finished. State, this is just very rough wireframes of what we're working on. We can, we're gonna Polish it up but it, we can then take it and… review it and approve it if it looks right? And what this will also eventually be formatted, in the same format that is in mip, where in the accounts payable, how we have those different, the… different sections in mip, it'll pre pop it'll, populate it according to that. And so we'll have the debit and credit side of these entries. And so, but to do that, one of the things that we need to do is train our model, the AI and teach it how to parse out these invoice and to create that, the entry. And so what I want to do is with like Sabrina, Michelle David. Your guys' approval is go… into mip and pull down a bunch of those… entries and load them into the model and have it train on those. Would that be okay to do that?

Good afternoon.
Scott T: Hey, Chris. How are you doing today?
Chris G: I'm doing well. I wanted to let you know. I did get everything set up for the cloud amplifier integration. So thank you again for your time last week with kind of walking me through the concerns and considerations there. Maybe, you know, one or two other follow up questions after I've you know, gone through the whole process there. But overall very smooth and happy to say we've got some of those views all ready to go now.
Scott T: Very cool. Nice. It's good to hear that was going to be one of my first questions to ask you. So that's a great update to start the meeting with. I also wanted to introduce a new member from Domo that you see on the call, Alex, dengate, he's a new technical consultant and he's going to be kind of helping out with this engagement as we need some extra resources or not, but just wanted to introduce him. Do you want to introduce yourself a little bit, Alex?
Alex D: Hey, I'm Alex, I'm new to the team. I'm looking to support Scott wherever he needs help at. So I'm kind of just Scott's lackey at the moment, but I'll probably get more integrated as the projects go on. So.
Scott T: Good to meet you. He's a new member to the team. I did have a question, the other questions I had. So I know that you're still running into that API issue and the response from the data sets not being what you're expecting. I thought I was going to get. Do you know, or can you send me like an exact example of the API call? Because I feel like I had asked for that and I didn't maybe I missed an email or didn't ask for an email?
Chris G: I can, yeah, this is a super simple one. I can just share real quick. And then I'll send it to your email here at the same time. Yeah.
Scott T: That'd be great.
Chris G: Let me just, I… think some of my things got closed out here. So one second, I gotta thought I had that up. Let's see. That's new. All right. Well, I'll stop sharing my screen here and I'll look for that in the background and I'll pull it up here when I find it. This may take me a second. Yeah.
Scott T: No worries. So, even the issue is that it's still the API call that you're making is returning a Json object instead of just, or kind of like a nested Json object instead of like what the documentation says it should return, right?
Chris G: Yep.
Scott T: Yeah. So, I have that, I have like an email written up, but I was waiting to actually give them an exact example of what the call was, to see if we could troubleshoot what that is because it does seem like it's not giving you the right response based on our documentation. So, yeah… and I think I only had one other option, one other thing to bring up. And since Jenna wasn't here at the start of the call, I'm going to keep going, the sandbox repository list. So, I feel like last time we spoke, you were going to meet with finance and see if we can get, a list of kind of smaller repositories to generate out of that huge list of thousands of cards. Yeah, any progress on that?
Chris G: Yes. And I actually met with them, while, I was out in salt lake earlier this week, been traveling, so I met with them in person and reiterated the request, but they do not have that data back to me, just yet. So, I'm, going to be sending them an email here, pretty quickly as well. But, yeah, apologies, we don't have that. I, unfortunately, don't control finances, response time.
Scott T: Okay. No, that's right? No problem. Let me see if I can get in here. And so… in terms of your sandbox instances, like, I know that we had issues with the naboo sales. We worked through that initial, repository and getting that set up. Have you… have we looked to setting up any of your other sandboxes yet?
Chris G: We have not, I have been, waiting… to hear back from finance to try to close on that one. And we have mostly been pushing out our meetings with our, counterparts here, waiting to get that resolved. But, yeah.
Scott T: So, I know, I cause I know finance was the other finance was the other complicated one, but I was just wondering if it would make sense to like let's get on a call and set up some of the more simple ones, while we're you know, while we're waiting to get that data back from finance, right? So, especially ones where like they're not even really interested in having any report like any data that's currently in Domo pushed into their sandbox, let's get those set up so they can start, you know, developing their own content if they want. And we can start maybe reaching out to who's going to be the power user there and getting some training going and stuff. So, I think that would be a worthwhile time while we're waiting for finance. Yeah.
Chris G: So, let me ask you a question. So, on Tuesday, let me see, double check the time here. I have time with those folks at let's see it's 10 30 Eastern Time. So, what is that? Eight 30 Utah time? Yeah, that is when I meet with those folks. Would it make sense? Or would you guys be available to, you know, come in and, you know, maybe meet the team talk with our business users?
Scott T: Yeah. So, I have a 30 minutes available. Oh, wait that's on Tuesday. Sorry, hang on one second.
Chris G: Yeah, I know Monday's a holiday.
Scott T: Yeah… I do still have, wait, you said eight, what time? Eight 30 Utah time? Eight 30 Utah time? Okay. Let's see. That would be… I think I could make a half an hour, eight 30 to nine work.
Chris G: For me. Okay, I mean, yeah.
Scott T: So go ahead and invite me to the meeting. Yeah. Okay.
Chris G: Yeah, I will forward that to you. I, we have that meeting every week, so, you know, if not this week, if, you know, it's too early, we could always do the following week, but, yeah, I can, I'm.

Phil S: Hey, bill afternoon, Phil. How are you doing? Good. Happy Friday. Happy.
William D: Friday.
Phil S: What's your flight schedule look like with next week? I still gotta make up. Oh, yeah.
William D: When are we? I'm just going there now.
Phil S: Hey, Bryce.
Brice W: Hey, what's going on?
Phil S: Happy Friday. I know you deserve a weekend, man. And I know you guys are in a PLM implementation, dealing with techs for me all the time and all kinds of stuff. So, thank you for all you're doing above and beyond your job description. Ah, no problem.
Brice W: No problem. This week's. Done. Yeah, we're almost there. So.
Phil S: Absolutely, man. Well, we might have a, I never tell them so.
Brice W: Yeah, that's the famous last words. As soon as I said them, it's like, dang. It. I just screwed up my afternoon.
William D: I see things coming in on my calendar. I'm like really.
Brice W: Second shift starts tomorrow. How many different games and places do I have to be for activities? So, I.
William D: just got my kids' hockey tournaments this weekend. It's like two on Saturday, one, maybe two on Sunday. I'm like, okay, not that far this time, so that's okay.
Brice W: That's good. Don't.
Phil S: Have to leave the state. Yeah.
William D: I do have to leave the state but it's not that far. So, it's good.
Phil S: That's good.
William D: It's actually easier to leave the state in this case than it was last weekend was further. So this is good.
Brice W: Oh, geez.
Phil S: Awesome. Well, yeah, we can hop into it, Bryce, because I know, yeah, your afternoon's awaiting you. So we'll get through some quick questions on our side. The whole goal I would say like kind of three things I was hoping to touch on today. One is just kind of understanding or getting your thoughts on where does the PLM end? And where does Domo begin? And how we can tell that story, right? That's one of the things I just wanted to brainstorm with you not saying we're going to get to a solution here, but at least like get us on the right track. The other one was just Mike had some great feedback around or just, it seems like it hasn't resonated quite yet on his side around current state versus future state. Like, all right. I see these numbers, but are you really going to save me an hour a day? Like, and why will you save me an hour a day, right? Like what's the current one versus what's the future one? So we obviously can't do everything right or the whole implementation before the decision's made. But we thought maybe there's one thing we can pick like one workflow that we could like map out, hey here's you know, current state and here's future state and then art of the possible, you know, Mike can kind of grasp it from there. And the third one is just kind of like where we're at in the process of like do we need to get competitive bids? Like some of those like, you know, logistical questions, but any. Anything else you'd add to that? Are there things you think? Or, yeah from the Domo side that we would, you know, want to ask of Bryce as well before Tuesday?
William D: I think it's great to ask Bryce if there's other additions and then maybe we take them one at a time and knock them out and kind of get an understanding?
Brice W: Okay. I guess which one you want to start with Phil?
Phil S: Yeah. Let's start with just in your mind, like where's the, or I know that you already, you, know this and have put together graphs. You've done a great job putting that all together. But I'm curious kind of if you feel the same sentiment of like it feels like Mike is still struggling with that. Like, well, what is trade beyond going to do? And I think that the core conundrum that we're in is like, hey, we're competing against the PLM but the PLM doesn't do what we do and we don't do what the PLM does. And it's kind of puts Mike in a spot where it's still, it seems like still is not quite, you know, resonating on, you know, what are we actually competing with? So curious, kind of yeah, what your thoughts are, and how we can tell that story better.
Brice W: Right. And I think adding a little bit to it is Mike was an exterior like an external hire for home depot. So I forget, I think he said he's been here three months. I don't know how long it's been. So he's kind of drinking from a fire hose right now. So if you kind of look at it with that, yeah, that from that side of things. So it's not like, oh, he came over from logistics or he came over from the quality side or something like he came from a completely different culture coming in and just trying to learn the acronyms and stuff like that. So I think whenever you, whenever you're bringing something like that to him, I think that's kind of a good place to think about too at, that point is that he's picking up a lot of it quickly like sitting through, the SP meetings this week, we had. So this week, we had a summit with all of our third party labs that we work with. It's kind of like a state of the business type thing. And, you know, he did fine. I think, you know, I was like, oh, okay. He already knows, this process. So he's getting a lot thrown at him. He's picking up a lot. So it's just like that, some of the nitty gritty details and stuff like that, he still, you know, is picking up on as we go. So for like how to explain… where Domo plays in this whole thing. Is there's… right now? I wouldn't say… we're also building the plane as we're trying to land it too. So we've gotten a little bit more clarity. I think it was this week. I don't know. They stacked the meetings on top of us a little bit clear on how the grouping is going to work through the PLM. Okay? So I'm feeling a little bit more certain that the grouping can be done in the PLM, which is good because everything sits in there anyway. Yeah, which would lend itself to a more natural breakaway point as if you were trying to bolt on to flex right now. So the steps that they kind of go through is you have and we have a slide for it, the awards then they go into data collect, which is just a fancy way of saying, you know, loading all the information into the system and then it gets thrown from ",Consumption Pricing Model,338173.18,Enterprise,HOMEDEPOT.COM,3,Retail,475000,>=$1B,New Logo,Sales,3: Demonstrate Value,Phil Stewart,2026-03-27,2025-07-22,2025-07-22,2025-09-10,,,,,0015000000YrkyqAAB

Ankit S: There was a ton of warnings out there for sure from the earthquake that hit over in Russia, and I don't know if they got hit, but I do know that like southern California got the same warnings and I checked in with family out there, and they said they got nothing, so, thankfully, nothing.

Carlos M: got, obviously, they had the first warning for the tsunamis and I called her right away and she just told me like they rushed over to costco and they were just getting food and water and stuff and people were just going crazy like they were just taking all the food from the shelves and everything, just in case, lucky for them. Like they're like on the higher part of the island, but yeah, like they did get hit like on the shores, I don't think it did much damage but yeah, it's crazy.

Josh D: Good to see you guys.
Ankit S: All right. Well, I'd love to start with a quick intro for Shane. As we mentioned last week, Shane is our lead technical consultant for this engagement. So I'll give him a second and as well as the innovated team, I know you didn't have a chance to meet him. So, yeah, we'll start it off with Shane.
Shane W: Yeah. So I'm Shane wright, I'm a consultant here at Domo. I've been here about 10 years and spent a lot of time working on the backend getting data into Domo, digesting it, getting it ready to visualize… you know, setting up Domo everywhere, getting things going. So I'm excited to help you guys and be your point of contact. Cool.
Joey K: Great. I'm Joey, I'm the chief underwriting officer at innovative holdings. I oversee the underwriting product development and the data team here. So I'll let josh and Maggie introduce themselves.
Josh D: I'm josh, I'm the senior analyst on the data team. So Maggie and I work quite a bit in Domo. I guess I'll let Maggie introduce herself before I dive into our usage of Domo.
Maggie T: Yeah. Hi, I'm Maggie, I've been with the team for about two years now also an analyst working Domo, probably daily. Awesome.
Ankit S: And josh, I did provide a little detail to the team after our sync last week just to give them more heads up of what you're looking to kind of optimize in Domo. I know we talked about AI agents. We talked about just optimizing the dashboards more as well as the data sets, and also more of an overview with app studio. But now, of course, with Shane being here, I'm sure there's gonna be more questions on his end, but I'll let you take it away, josh.
Josh D: Sure. So let me see if I can just share my screen might be easiest. All right. Hopefully it's working properly.
Shane W: Yeah, we see it.
Josh D: Yes. All right. Perfect. So we have made a concerted effort to move from the dashboards to the apps just because we like the layout of the apps. They feel a bit more modern. The CFM analysis one is probably our most… used one. I feel, I don't know what's going on here. This is usually populated, so bad timing for that, but. We, I feel like we have a good handle on the apps unless it's just something we aren't aware of or missing… you know, we are using the tabs… you know, we put our graphs in here. We've got different pages. We've got the dropdown filters. So I feel like we're using the app studio to its capabilities. But maybe there's something we're again just not aware of… you know, I think on the last call the discussion was we feel like we've got a good handle on demo, but there's probably functions that we're not aware of that we're just not utilizing. So that's probably like the biggest question on our end… in terms of app studio. Is there anything major? You think we're not taking advantage of?
Shane W: Yeah. I mean, it's hard to there's so many, there's a lot of functionality in demo, right? So it's hard to say, well, you know, what would be good for you guys to use here? But there's inside of app studio, one of the things I think is pretty cool is like it's for the forms functionality where you can embed a form inside of app studio. So if you were, if you had, if you were displaying like this for a manager, they could go, and they could input data on that. So I don't know like if you're doing like a quarterly review or something like that, you could have each of the managers look at their area and enter in data about their numbers, that could all be aggregated together to then so that the leadership could look at that and say, okay, this is what's going on with, you know, the east division or whatever it is. So that that's one functionality that I, that I've seen a lot of people take advantage of, is that forms capability just to be able to have people be able to enter in data right rig",Consumption Pricing Model,75000.59999999999,Corporate,CFMIMO.COM,11,Manufacturing,16,$10M to <$25M,Upsell,Blank,3: Demonstrate Value,Carlos Mercader,2026-03-25,2025-03-05,2025-03-05,2025-03-05,2025-05-13,,,,0015000000yx3ikAAA

","Scott B: hi, Scarlett. Hey, shailaja. How are you doing well? How are you doing good?
Shailaja G: It's been a while a little bit.
Scott B: Yep. It's been a while. What can I help you with?
Shailaja G: Yes. So, you have seen my email, esteem kind of asked me if… we could update the domain name? Oh.
Scott B: Yeah.
Shailaja G: Yeah. So I put in a request and it looks like I… wanted, I mean, I have been assigned some Pollock who is your customer support person, I guess, and she sent… me a few things and I wanted to touch base with you to understand what are we dealing with? Because she asked if we are changing the main domain instance itself, meaning are we going to create a new instance and other questions like that, and I wasn't sure if that was necessary. So I wanted to touch base with you.
Scott B: They shouldn't have to create a new domain. They should just be able to swap over the existing to the new nomenclature.
Shailaja G: Yeah. So if you were to see the case details and I'm happy to.
Scott B: Let me just pull it up. Give me just a second.
Shailaja G: Share my screen too. It ends with two five, six one.
Scott B: Two five, six, one. Okay. I've got it.
Shailaja G: Yeah.
Scott B: Okay. So, Pollock… understanding and concerning regarding domain name change?
Shailaja G: See the latest from her maybe on October sixth?
Scott B: October six?
Shailaja G: Yeah.
Scott B: We'll proceed with the current case for the first domain change… for the second domain?
Shailaja G: She said she'll put it in another folder?
Scott B: Oh, I think, I see what's going on. I think I understand what's going on? Okay? So, you know, how it's two, dash two. It's because it's a subdomain. Okay? And so a subdomain because it carried the two and then added dash two. What… if we just changed it to, what if we just changed your HR domain to envedabio. Domo? Com?
Shailaja G: We just want enveda. Com.
Scott B: Okay. So, what if we just do it to enveda? Com? Domo? Com, and then we could do enveda, it, the problem that we're having is the main domain name? It gets hyphenated for the second domain. So, if it's envedahr, it will be… envedahr, it.
Shailaja G: I see what?
Scott B: Okay. So, if we could just do enveda for your main instance, then we could do enveda. It. Okay?
Shailaja G: Yeah, I'm fine with that. Yeah.
Scott B: Okay. So, let me reach out to Palak and see if we.
Shailaja G: Can, okay. And also, she mentioned a few other things that need to happen. And before my concern, is there some things that will break down? Like she said, see… the text on the board? Yeah?
Scott B: I see it.
Shailaja G: Like work bent jobs must be updated to the new URL, correct? Sso, config must be updated to the new URL that's correct, which is probably in rippling. And then custom API integration must point to the new URL, When she says custom.
Scott B: So, if you have built out any custom connectors or if you're making any API calls, the domain is gonna change. So you'll need to update those. Okay? Not any connectors we're not talking about like pre built connectors or anything. But if you have built any, let's say you have like a script that was making a post to the Domo domain, you have to update that because your domain name is gonna change. Okay? That's all it's saying.
Shailaja G: And then the data sets created with the data set via email connector, are you using?
Scott B: The email connector today? So we'll probably have to re, establish that. I'm guessing.
Shailaja G: Okay. Do a new email connector and things like that?
Scott B: Yep. How many of them do you have? Just the one?
Shailaja G: At least two or three data sets are coming via email connectors at least if not more. Yeah.
Scott B: So, the reason for that is because the email connector, the way that's working today is it creates an email address that you forward that email to and then it's connecting via Domo API and it's sending that as a call to Domo. And so that connector specifically doesn't know that there's a domain name change. So you'll have to reset that one out. Okay? Hopefully that's not too big of a burden. But.
Shailaja G: Yeah. I just wanted to know the scope that's why I wanted to understand with you to know the scope of this because I was not planning for that. This quarter. I have other projects that I want to do in Domo, which are a priority. And maybe this can wait. Okay? Maybe we can call this like a, hey, understand the scope, the changes that need to happen. Yeah. And then.
Scott B: This should be a scheduled change anyway. So usually they won't do it until you're ready to do it.
Shailaja G: Right.
Scott B: And then they'll schedule a time for you to do it. So actually, I think it would be easier if you can just reach out to Pollock and say, I understand the request. Let's change the HR instance just to enveda Domo. Com. And then it would be enveda it for the second instance. But let's put this project on hold until you're ready. I don't I mean, usually, the domain like the email connector shouldn't be too hard to set up, but there's also consequences downstream because you now, it will produce a new email address that you need to now be sending those emails to.
Shailaja G: Correct. And this data set, the old one would just sit there. And now there will be a new data set, right? It's a lot of mapping. So.
Scott B: You'll have to do some mapping, yeah, some mapping for that too, because I assume that new email connector, it's just doing an append, right?
Shailaja G: I think it's replacing every time it's bringing all the,
Scott B: data. Well, if it's doing a replace, then you can just, it would replace all your historic data.
Shailaja G: Right. Yeah. So then it makes.
Scott B: that a little bit easier.
Shailaja G: Yeah, I think so. I think so. Okay. Yeah. But still, that's a little bit of work. Yeah. And then there are about seven steps you mentioned about Google sheets need to be re authenticated, although I don't think we have anything there.
Scott B: Okay.
Shailaja G: Word excel, perfor and plugins need to be. I don't think we have that data sets created via the Domo governance data sets connector need to be re. Authentic",Consumption Pricing Model,28000.0,Corporate,ENVEDABIO.COM,2,Life Sciences,1,$10M to <$25M,,,,,,,,,,,,,001Vq0000021RTFIA2

Shivam M: Yes, yes, yes. Like in news, I have heard that, you know, this year, you know, the rain has crossed the last 63 years mark. Thanks to redstone, they are keeping me safe at home.
Brian F: Yeah, yeah. We're in our, so I'm in North Carolina and this is our hurricane scene, but luckily, we haven't had any. We had one that came kind of close to shore and.

Brian F: I was just, I was over here just filling the dead air. It's okay.
Juliana J: Awesome. I think we've got everyone. So today, we really wanted to do kind of a little bit more discovery on those dashboards that we had started talking about last week that we want to get into your demo everywhere portal. And then I believe Brian has maybe some examples of app studio as well to showcase. So, yeah, anything else you guys want to cover today in addition to that?
Shivam M: I think this is good.
Juliana J: Okay. That's great. And I think this will kind of unlock our next step so we can hopefully get like a proposal going for that demo everywhere use case and see what it's going to take to get that portal up and running. And then we can also talk at the end about maybe getting some office hours on if there's some other items, I know that there were some stuff in your roadmap that maybe we want to cover during office hours as well. So, we'll circle back and talk about that at the end. Yeah, I'll hand it over to Brian.
Brian F: Okay. So I did have some notes from last time. I know we talked a little bit about app studio and there were something a couple things specifically you were looking at, thinking about like how do we filter to a particular month? How do we filter to a particular date period and things like that? So I put together, some really it's a demo environment and I just kind of be aware. I didn't go. I didn't spend the time and make sure everything works exactly right? So you may see some things go blank. But I wanted to make sure that I had something to show you but I didn't want to take the time to dig through all of, the data, all the data. So… this is an example. So first step, what I did is I grabbed the two dashboards, the mjw and mjw version two dashboard. And all I did is I went in and said import them right? And you just imported what you had directly into appstudio. And now I have a pay, I have a dashboard. And then I took the second one and it's a second tab. I batted some stuff in there. But basically I just took it imported it and I had something to start from. So the first thing I wanted to show is this month filter. Because what I noticed is I think in your cards, you were already filtering them to the target month, right? So rather than having the card filter to a particular month, we wanted it to be dynamic. So what I did is I created this filter and I used that same logic and so it will default to target month, but you can also go forward if you wanted to. Didn't know if that was relevant, but you can also go backwards, right? So you can see how here it's changing and all these numbers are changing and some of the stuff changed. Some of it goes blank. That's what I was saying that's kind of where playing with some of it. But this is the one example. So if it's just a monthly, the data is in there by month, this would allow you to go and pick whatever month you want to. Does that make sense? And it was that kind of like in for this sense, was that one of the use that was one of the use cases? I think, yeah there.
Shivam M: Is one thing, sorry, Shannon. You're great. So what… I was saying that when I look at the month filter every particular card, they have a specific target month, for example, for noi, that is N minus two for some other data. For example, for leasing data, this is current month. So target the definition of target month for every card. Like for most of the card, it's different. So that was the key problem.
Shannon C: Yeah, because we have some data that updates monthly, but like a month in arrears, like our financial data, we have to wait till the fifteenth and then they close the prior month and then you can be able to see the updated stuff. But for leasing data, you can be able to see that in real time for like what they're doing and the clients wants to be able to see that. So that's been one of the things that's been really tough is we want to be able to like look at financial data for when it's the most like finalized like, you know, a prior month and then leasing data for what's happening currently. So they can be able to kind of see the difference in that. So that's been the thing that's been a little bit tough. And we want them to be able to select for prior months for the leasing data as well. But they also want to be able to select for the current month.
Brian F: And all of this is on the same dashboard.
Shannon C: Yes, what we could possibly make it into different tabs if that's what we needed to do, if we needed to be like all current data versus all, maybe that's the way that we kind of solve it is that we like have stuff that it's like these are things that are month in arrears and that's like what the filter is for it. And these are things that are current maybe that's the way we have to s",Consumption Pricing Model,44071.95,Corporate,REDSTONERESIDENTIAL.COM,7,Other,308,$5M to <$10M,Renewal,Blank,2: Determine Needs,Bria Rogers,2026-06-17,2025-06-18,2025-06-18,,,,,,0013800001C0Qy3AAF

Kyle S: Hey, Scott. Good. How are you?
Scott P: Living the dream, alright?
Chris S: Hello?
Spencer M: So, Scott, I think this is everyone from our apex side, Chris, are you waiting for anyone else from your side?
Chris S: Yeah. I did invite Kyle bates, but he might be in a different time zone and so he might not have seen it yet. So I don't think we'll wait.
Spencer M: For him. Okay. So, Scott, I don't know how much of a background you got on our situation, but I'll do a quick run through for you. We have an internal application that we build and our version one is slowly getting out of date. So we're in the process of doing some testing on building the new application with the mongodb backend. And before we get too far into that, we're testing out implementing that database into Domo. We're currently do the one now through workbench and push that up as flat, just the SQL server. So, we're just kind of seeing some best practices to make sure we approached our build of our new application both from a usability aspect for the application, but also for data maintenance and didn't know if there was best practices if it was putting things through a transition layer with some middleware or how the Domo connection would work, getting to mongodb data. So, we're hoping for some advice from you from there.
Scott P: All right. Let me pull up.
Spencer M: All right.
Scott P: So, Domo does have a direct connector with mongodb. We should be able to connect directly to your… guys', instance of mongodb.
Spencer M: We did play around with that and notice quickly that the way that the data gets flattened, makes it so that you have to be a little more precise with how you set up and connect to the data. So that was kind of one of the things that we ran into. And Kyle, you might be able to put that into better words than I just did.
Kyle S: Yeah, I mean, yeah, right. We have no problem connecting it up and pulling data, but the problem, yeah, really, it's like the usability of the data from what we're trying to do on the Domo side of things… and if you just kind of pull it in, you just end up with a bunch of non usable columns because the names are there's just really no way to use that. So obviously.
Scott P: No.
Kyle S: One here?
Scott P: Is, yeah.
Kyle S: I mean, basically how it's just taking the, you know, the documents and flattening them out as best as it can. So, you know, no one here is really like a Mongo expert. And then in turn, so none of us really know or really… ever tried to, you know, turn it back into to a flat style database. You know… we did look around, you know, obviously you can use some queries to try to get out some of the stuff. We were just hoping you guys had some insight like with previous customers who have large Mongo deployments… maybe you can give us some direction.
Scott P: Yeah. The customers that I've worked with like they haven't expressed like the same issues, like would you be able to show me an example of like one of these that you have pulled in… that way I can see like how?
Spencer M: Yeah, I have one.
Kyle S: Yeah. Do you still have that in there? Spencer?
Spencer M: Yeah.
Kyle S: Okay. All.
Spencer M: Right. So… on this one kind of what we're seeing is that if we have like a singular client key, what ends up happening is that we get repeated columns. So like this is asset zero and then we get to the next one and it becomes asset one. And instead of like that being flattened out as a row, we're getting our things all spread out as different asset types.
Kyle S: Okay. Basically, there's a lot of embedded documents.
Spencer M: Yeah. So what happens? Yeah. So we're kind of expecting each of these columns to have been pivoted to be a row instead of a column.
Scott P: Got it. And can we take a look at the settings?
Spencer M: Yeah. Looks like this one is taking a little bit to load here, but, yeah. We're essentially just… pulling up the collection and calling it. I wonder if this one is loading.
Kyle S: Just for clarification, it is technically cosmos, it is coming from azure. It's not a true Mongo deployment.
Scott P: Yeah, but I feel like there are a lot of wrappers around Mongo where it's like built… on top of Mongo?
Kyle S: Yeah, that's.
Scott P: not uncommon. And we'll still typically use the mongodb connector usually.
Kyle S: Yeah, I will say, you know, in this instance, we don't have any projections or anything of this data. It's just coming in and being flattened regular. I know there is some things you can do with whatever Mongo calls their language that they use. Try to make sense of some of the data and get out some of the embedded documents. But I'm… not sure depending on how deeply nested you are, like what that would really look like.
Scott P: Yeah. So, I think that this option is meant like if something is coming in as… an array, like if you had an individual column where it was like add an array or a list of… objects in it.
Kyle S: But not really embedded documents inside of what you're bringing in.
Scott P: Yeah, right. I think that what our best bets may be to try and use jupyter workspaces to flatten or to like essentially like because obviously… what Domo is doing, Domo works with like tabular data like store data in, you know, that flat file format with columns and rows. So if it's not parsing it correctly with the connector, I don't know how much flexibility we have to change how it's parsing here. Yeah. But if we were to go with a solution like jupyter, you… could custom how that data is being processed before you write it to a dataset, right? So essentially… we'd probably just build a connection string to connect to your mongodb, hold the collection you want, and then need to customize the script to get it into the format we want before saving it to a dataset.
Kyle S: Makes sense.
Scott P: Does anybody here have experience… scripting?
Kyle S: Yes.
Chris S: I also wanted to, you know, I wanted to kind of explain where this source data comes from and how it's structured. It is three levels deep, as Kyle said. So it's nested three levels.

Joe P: Morning, everyone.
Michael N: Morning, Joe. I had, I went to the gym this morning at dark 30 and took my Mercedes out for the first time in a very long time and it ran, which was surprising.
Dale W: Well, you wouldn't want to get that queue messy? Yeah.
Michael N: Well, I got to sell the Mercedes. So I got to run the engine and I put some treatment in there, burn… all.
Dale W: That carbon out of there. Yeah.
Michael N: And, it's a supercharged engine. So, if you don't drive it for a while, it does gunk up. Hey morning, Kevin, morning, Matthew.
Dale W: Morning. What's your favorite part about those older cars? It's pretty basic stuff, right? Fuel and air in, yeah, power out. Yeah.
Michael N: For the most part, this model had really old computer systems in it. So like, I have a warning light that says front, parking, front, right? Parking light out there's. No light out. Nice. And I don't know how to shut that off. It's.
Dale W: Well, that's got to be a, so… it's going to be looking for an open circuit. It's got to be analog, right? Yeah. So, it's got to be looking for either an open circuit or there's an inductor in line with it to check the current coming across it.
Michael N: I'm going to drop it off at my neighbor's house today. He is a Mercedes master mechanic, and he just built a shop in his garage. Nice. So he gets the car and two bottles of wine, and then I'll pick it up Monday.

Joe P: But she doesn't have her auto office on. So maybe she is back.
Michael N: Okay. You're paying her? Okay. I just pinged her. So, are we waiting for Brendan and Tracy? Are they going to make it today?
Dale W: Brendan's idle. Tracy's idle so we can go ahead and get started. And then if they've got anything, they can come around.
Michael N: Okay, awesome. Okay. What do we have from the team this morning? Dale? Is it okay if I record this just in case Tiva doesn't make it?
Dale W: Yeah.
Michael N: Okay. Awesome. All right. What do we got this morning?
Dale W: So, I think the big thing is our continuation from our conversation that's been ongoing for a while now, right? But kind of came to a head yesterday… we're kind of stuck in a situation where we cannot successfully hand off between pages and tabs and keep the filter context consistent across all of that?
Michael N: Was there a workaround by Shane Dale or by Ben anyone?
Dale W: So, the, Shane, we had a, Matthew built a similar thing to Shane's recommendation. He built his own brick. He put it on the page. The core construct. Is that or the core challenge? Is there's no way to read page filters? There's only a way to react to updating of page filters. So, what's happening is that if you like in the case of Shane's recommendation that Matthew had built independently, if the brick loads faster than everything else, then you're sleeping and waiting to try to make sure that everything loads and that load time can take several seconds before all of a sudden, this thing will show up.
Michael N: Oh, got it.
Dale W: And so, because there's no way to read and there's no way to kind of, you know, every originally we were trying to pass messages, you know, demo navigate is reckless with how it's navigating things across, you know, the new UX is even not great with it because the toolbar is showing back up again and that's a new undocumented feature with demo navigate. So really, I mean, you know, the functionality challenge that's in front of us is we've got multiple apps and we're trying to figure out how to pass a message between them. There's no good solve for it, but even the hacky solves aren't working.
Michael N: Yeah.
Dale W: And so, and the fact that, you know, we're saying now as of yesterday that, oh, now that's a massive rewrite and that's not going to happen. Well, I mean, we flagged this so early in the year. It's not kind of it's not great an answer that we can really handle right now.
Michael N: Yeah. Did Ben have any suggestions?
Dale W: Ben brought up the P filter suggestion. Matthew is testing that this morning. The problem with the P filter is that the tab group is not loading all of the tabs… what's happening is… let.
Joe P: me.
Dale W: show you on… this screen here. So, when you navigate over and this is QA, not dev, so we're going to get a little bit of a different experience, there are these tabs. So the P filter will work for this tab or for this app that's in this tab, but it will not work on these tabs.
Michael N: Lovely.
Dale W: So, you… know… I know Ben and then this back button's inconsistent like does it go back all the time? Sometimes it navigates all the way out of the scoping tool like there's just and then the home button's disappearing randomly. There's just things that are fundamentally wrong here and we're not sure what's going on and it's getting really frustrating that, you know… we don't feel we're kind of guessing on our own.
Michael N: Yeah.
Dale W: It's just trial and error.
Michael N: Joe, can we, is there anybody we can get that can dig into this and start to get, gather all of the stuff to troubleshoot it? At least we get roll that up to Joe, to bill and Payne to Ben and Payne?
Joe P: I think Ben's aware Dale, you chatted with Ben last night, I think, right?
Dale W: Yep.
Joe P: I saw, I think it's where it needs to be right now, Mike. I just, I don't think there's a solution at the moment.

Jesse P: Yes, I haven't had a chance to do the trainings yet, but I have started looking over some of the like, just the basic documentation that you sent over?
Jenna H: Yeah. I mean, there's definitely a lot. Yeah. And what's wild is, gosh, Scott like app studio has been around for maybe like two years, Ish,
Scott T: yeah. About that. I mean, I feel like every couple of quarters, it gets a pretty healthy dose of updates, right? So it feels like it's still pretty new in the sense that a lot of the features just keep getting changed and updated and better and.
Jenna H: That's kind of what I was going to speak to is like it's newer but it's very robust and they keep adding a lot of new features and functionality to app studio and I really feel like that is going to wind up being the way a lot of designing and building happens in the future. So, I think it's and plus, I love how polished things can look in app studio versus just a traditional page. Yeah.
Scott T: So, for,
Jesse P: sure. Gemma, did you get, did you get the link or not the link? But the permission that I added you to for the app studio forethought deflection dashboard that's the one that we were kind of hoping to check out and convert really, it's just like as an example. It was a pretty small page that's fairly new that we know is going to get some decent traction in the next few months. So we figured that would be a good place to like have you show us how to do it and then we'll make whatever adjustments we need to the actual page afterwards.
Jenna H: Okay. Yeah.
Scott T: I just dumped the link in the chat for you, Jenna. Thank you.
Jenna H: I had it pulled up, but thank you for the assist. Oh,
Scott T: okay. All right. No problem.
Jenna H: Okay. All right. So also, I don't know if you saw in the email that I sent there is a live hands on training app studio session happening today. So I don't know if your schedules allow for that.
Jesse P: I don't think I'll have time today. Unfortunately, I got a little bit too much on the plate but maybe I can catch the next one.
Jenna H: Yeah, I think they do it monthly. It's part of just like the new, they're doing a lot of new monthly. Trainings that happen regularly. So.
Jesse P: Okay.
Jenna H: And I… think if you look, I think you can see when it's scheduled for October already, but so this is our dashboard.
Jesse P: Yep.
Jenna H: All right. So what I'm going to do here is I'm just going to open up a new tab and we're going to go to apps and looks like somebody's been playing around with some apps in your instance.
Jesse P: Probably rob.
Jenna H: A lot of them aren't named. So I'm not sure. Great program sounds very intriguing though.
Jesse P: Yeah, that's our like social media style like praise your teammates situation.
Jenna H: Gotcha. So what we'll do here is we're going to Qlik on this orange, create app button, but before we do that, I do want to point out up here if you hit where it says view more resources below.
Jesse P: Here.
Jenna H: It's a newer navigational assistance feature. We see here. They've got some app studio videos that you can use to Qlik on and reference. So that could be really cool. And then you can also Qlik on some of these different pieces here, training knowledge base training course and they've.
Jesse P: got some.
Jenna H: Other stuff here. So if you ever see this like bar up here at the top, I know it does tend to blend in if you're focused on what's on like the body of the page, but sometimes they have some really helpful stuff… that is applicable to what you're looking at there. That could just be worth a Qlik if you have a moment.
Jesse P: Okay.
Jenna H: Okay. So with apps, what's really cool too is you can have app themes and the beauty of themes is you can customize them, everything from colors to spacing within the cards, borders, drop shadows, all the things. And once you have your theme, it makes everything consistent on your app. So it looks super cohesive versus having to, if you're putting cards on a regular page, you know, you have to change the background color of every single card individually and do all that. It makes you want to pull your hair out. You don't have to do that. With app studio, you can pick one of these pre built themes. Once you get your apps up and running, if you create a theme that you really like in one app, you can save that and make that a custom theme. And that would wind up kind of populating over here. So you could upload a custom theme here as well. So if you develop… your greenway health app.
Jesse P: Then you can.
Jenna H: just really reuse that and that takes all the formatting off like your plate. And the beautiful thing is too is if you get it done and somebody reviews it and they're like this is great. This is perfect. This has all 50 cards I need. I just don't love like the background color or the border or whatever. Instead of having to change them all individually, you just go and edit the theme for that type of card and it just unanimously changes it in every instance within that a",Consumption Pricing Model,250160.05,Corporate,GREENWAYHEALTH.COM,11,Retail,1310,$250M to <$500M,Renewal,Blank,2: Determine Needs,Rob Staples,2026-01-01,2024-01-11,2024-01-11,,,,,,0015000000vr9eVAAQ

Sam D: Yeah, I get it. I get it. It's all good. You guys doing okay though?
Scott B: Yeah, we were just talking about that. Things are going pretty good.
Sam D: So, Been happy. Listen, when your stock is up 120 percent year to date, that's a good thing, right? You've.
Scott B: been happy. That doesn't hurt.
Sam D: Right. Yeah, I'm kind of bummed. I didn't I should have bought it when I was at six bucks, what was I thinking? You know?
Scott B: Yeah, we've got an employee stock purchase option. Nice. So, when it was down, I changed that up a little bit. I'm glad.
Sam D: Yeah, down. And then like, you were like, I want to buy less or I want to buy more.
Scott B: No, when it was at like six, seven bucks, yeah, I upped.
Sam D: Good for you. Yeah, smart Guy. Smart Guy. Well, listen, I am in Domo support hell right now. I'm hoping you guys can help me. We're just running into some things that, let me, I'll prioritize because. Where do I begin? Hang on? Let me just share my screen. I think that might be the best place to start. Where so we have been, and, you know, I'm there's a couple of things that are really just kind of making our lives difficult right now. So, when I say Domo support hell, it's just like it's like one of those situations where it's like you kind of wish you could get better answers, and as opposed to, like, my God, I have so much, you're making me do so much work right now. And, you know, I'd rather just be told how to do what I need to do, and be done with it. But, so, let me share something exciting with you. We have, thanks to, you know, you guys, and Savannah, hopefully you guys can see my new tab, but, you know, we're like starting to, put the pedal to the metal with respect to self service environments, using instance management. And so, we have spun up three departments already. And, you know, I would say finances… all set, store ops, 90 percent there because we got a, we've got some 95 percent because we got that's where I've got a problem right now. And then, asset protection, I just need to move all of their content from our dev environment to our product environment, which we know how to do using sandbox. In the ops, space, we have this one user, he, he's the he's like the operations manager, nice Guy, intelligent, you know, very data hungry, very data savvy, has been, very interested in self service and Domo, but he, you know, unfortunately on our end and this is our own fault, you know, because we've been prioritizing other projects, self service and Domo has not materialized for him fast enough. And he's just like guys, I need a tool. And so, he's been, begging for, the data warehouse access. And we're we've kind of been like, no, no, no, like we don't want you going to the data warehouse, writing SQL queries to get answers to questions that you have, you should be using, you know, Domo, right? Because we, next thing, we know, he's going to start to production, productionalize things from the data warehouse and, you know, it's not a good situation to be in. Unfortunately, he has, you know, you've heard the phrase the squeaky wheel gets the grease. Yeah. So he has basically, you know, been a very squeaky wheel throws, you know, I know, you know, people like this that throws their weight around with respect to who they know. And, you know, he, you know, and rightfully, so he's just kind of like, he does get a lot. He does get beat up by our owners, a lot like he does, you know, he is, he has asked a lot of questions like that. He feels like he can do himself if he was given the tools to do it, but he doesn't have the tools, which is what's kind of led him to the whole like, you know, I, give me the data warehouse access. I will go to town, Jeff, you know, recently bent and said, all right, we'll give you the data warehouse access because, we know we have other departments in there, but the only reason the other departments exist in there is because it was before self service wasn't even a thing like it was like, we don't want this to continue to be a thing. We don't want people pulling their information from the data warehouse directly. We need them in Domo. So, I raced to get, this ops instance created. We added, three data sets, to, his ops instance, we raced to get these built for him. One's just, header level transaction data. You know, one is sales and inventory, and then the other, one is, sales, just sales, grouped by these, dimensions. And, you know, some of these are short term like this is last 90 days. This is, this year and last year. This one's last this year and last two years.

Bud.
Molly B: James, what's going on?
James L: Molly, I called this meeting to talk to you about some very important issues regarding Domo?
Molly B: All the wonderful things we're building. Well, what do you? Hello? Testing one two?
James L: I kind of talked over you. What did you say?
Molly B: Oh, no, it doesn't matter. No. Do you know what? The microphone on this computer is very weird? Like, do you remember when I first got it? I just wasn't you know, my audio just wouldn't work sometimes.
Benjamin P: It was so weird.
James L: That is weird.
Molly B: Can you hear me? Okay? Do I sound funny?
James L: No, no, you sound just fine.
Molly B: Excellent. Well, then I think we're good to go.
James L: Talk for one more second.
Molly B: One, two, three, four, five.
James L: There's a little bit of an echo, but it's not bad at all.
Molly B: Oh,
James L: it's really not bad. Okay. And I don't normally.
Molly B: It's just that you cranked the audio, turned everything up as loud as it'll go. I'll be sure to mute that when I'm not speaking just in case it drives anybody else crazy. Assuming we are joined, I hope we are.
James L: I know. Isn't that funny? They called the meeting. So, we'll see.
Molly B: Should update you on the call that I have with Jade actually. Do you know what I'm meeting with Regina after this? And I'll give you a call after I've spoken to Regina and I'll update you on the support center stuff.
Benjamin P: Cool.
Molly B: Hey, give me one sec. I'll be right back sure. Alright. I've returned.
James L: Yeah, it does sound just the tiniest bit weird, but it doesn't normally.
Molly B: Is it? I mean, it doesn't make sense that it's a zoom thing. Oh, wait, let me try this. If I like tilt it up a little bit. Can you hear, do you hear the echo when I do that?
James L: Hey guys.
Molly B: A.
James L: lot better. That now. Hey, how are you? Sorry?
Benjamin P: I was tied up on another call, so it took me a minute, not at all. Yeah.
James L: We almost turned up on you just kidding.
Benjamin P: It's like in college.
Molly B: The professor is 10 minutes late. You get to dip out.
Benjamin P: Yeah, that's right. Yeah. I know it's been a little while since we've met and so, I'm glad that we have an opportunity to come back together today. I want to show you what I've started on, get your feedback and thoughts and we can sort of iterate from here and continue building out the solution. So right now, our top priority is the lead management solution. And so we'll get to those, we'll get to those as well after we've sort of nailed this down. So I… am going to let's see. Yep. I'm still signed in perfect. So I'm going to share my screen well before I get started, anything top of mind for either one of you before I get started?
James L: No, no, I'm interested to kind of see where you're headed. Cool. Yeah, I'm excited. All right.
Benjamin P: So I've started building out this app and it's by no means a complete product right now. But I'll show you what we have. And so this is using your in contact data. So I'm going to show… you the dataset that I'm using. So I've created this dataset view that… simply applies the filters that we discussed. So skill name equals new patient abandoned equals true. And this is just for the last few days. And so it's 181 rows, which is a reduction down from the seven point 5,000,000 in the source data. So definitely much easier to manage with it just being two days worth of data and all the data that you see in all of these rows. This is the 180 calls that are in that dataset. I need to add paging to this so that you can toggle. Obviously, you're not going to want to scroll for eternity. And so I'll add some paging, I'll put 10 or 15 records per page so that you can easily navigate between them. And there's still some aesthetic work to do here too. So just, you know, this is the functional base we're certainly I'll certainly ensure that this, the visual piece of this is something that you enjoy working with as well. And so I've got notes here, tags, this is not going to be, you know, you… can select more than one tag here. But this is not typically what somebody thinks of when they have tags, right? You typically think of selecting a tag and then it has like a little box with an X in it, right? Where you can add or remove them. And so I'll make sure that that's done that way. These are the tags that are in here. I don't know what the tags are that you would actually want. So if you can put together a list of what those tags are, then I can populate this column with the appropriate tags worked by is something else we discussed. So if we wanted to assign each of these calls to a specific person or if somebody wanted to assign a call to themselves, then they would be able to do that by selecting the worked by, if you have a group that has been created in your instance with the users who you would want to be to not only have access to this tool but also to be a part of the list in the worked by column, that would be helpful if you don't have a group already put together and you want me to just put you James and Molly as the two selectable options for now. I can certainly do that. Until we've had a chance to test this and then we can add more users to that drop down menu after that… result here. These actually are the five results that we discussed on the last call. So appointment scheduled, spam, call, run number. Those are the five options location, much like the tags and the worked by. If you could help me know where to look for location, what that location would be, or if you want this to just be a free form text, I can make it a free form text as well. On the last call, we said that if somebody selects appointment scheduled, then before you're able to save, you would want location and patient number to be populated with a value. And so I'll add that functionality in there. If they select anything other than appointment scheduled, these two columns will not be required. They'll only be required if an appointment got scheduled. And so you can put in the values, you can fill out this information and then you can save and it would ",Consumption Pricing Model,50000.0,Corporate,RISASDENTAL.COM,8,Healthcare & Health Services,74,$10M to <$25M,Renewal,Blank,2: Determine Needs,Jennee Moore,2026-04-23,2023-03-17,2023-03-17,,,,,,0013800001GuYNAAA3

The team explored solutions such as using the Beast Mode Manager, data lineage, and variable controls, and agreed to further discuss user permissions and governance in the next meeting, as Ashli expressed a need for better understanding of the different permission levels and how to properly set up user groups.","Juliana J: hey, everyone.
Ashli M: Hello?
Juliana J: Happy Monday.
Brian M: Good afternoon.
Juliana J: We'll give Brian on our end another minute or two. I know we wanted to walk over, walk through some of the questions that Brian you had sent over. And then I know I had mentioned that we needed to wait until next week for the governance app, if will is able to join, which I'm not sure if he is, but if he's able to join, he actually did get that set up over the weekend. So I'm going to see if he can join the second half of the call maybe, and we might be able to walk through that. If not, we'll still save it for next week? Great. But yeah, awesome. Cool. So I will bring up those questions that Brian had sent over on Friday.
Ashli M: And I was able to review the recording for last week. So I'm up to speed perfect. So I appreciate you doing that.
Juliana J: Yeah. Do you have any questions on any of that we went over last week?
Ashli M: No, no. It only showed obviously the robust nature of the automation. There's several different thoughts and opportunities. So it was good.
Juliana J: Okay. I'm glad you guys got what you needed from that. So, all… right, cool. I guess, so Brian had sent over kind of three different points, to go over on today's. Call. I think one and three we are gonna look at on today's call. So, the first one was finding all objects that have been broken by a change in a data set. And then the second one was how to lock a card or a dashboard from edits… but letting the user still address the filter controls. So Brian Fentress, are you good to go to walk through those? Do you need a minute? I know you were probably just jumping from another call. If you're talking, you're on mute?
Brian F: I don't know why you couldn't hear me so.
Juliana J: I.
Brian F: guess the first question, first things first. So if I'm understanding the question correctly, Brian, you're saying like you go and you change the name of a field… and you wanted to see where all the cards that were impacted by that change and correct them is that?
Brian M: Right. Yeah, yeah, that, that's mostly it, if you make a change and then look at a card, it'll say, this field is no longer available, pick a new one. But I wasn't able to find any way of getting just like a full list of like here's, all the things that are now not seeing the field anymore. I just had to go through the lineage tree and like go and look at each individual thing to see if a particular change impacted it negatively. So, I was wondering if there was, any way to give this like here's a list of all the cards, and views and etls and stuff that are now throwing an error because something in their lineage changed, yeah.
Brian F: I guess my first question is I'm going to ask, Nick, do you know if there's anything in the in, like in the governance data sets or anything that lists cards that are broken?
Nik K: I don't think we have one that shows cards, but there should be one that shows broken beast modes, which would give you an idea of what might be broken on cards, and then we can map those beast modes to which cards have been broken, so we can build that out. Okay?
Brian M: But,
Brian F: that assumes there's a, that it's a beast mode, that field is used in a beast mode, correct?
Nik K: If it's directly used in a card… let me check because there is a report that tells you where fields might be used. I'll have to explore that. So.
Brian F: And so, and also, Brian, are you talking about something that is like upstream of a final data set? Or are you talking about? You're typically like something that would change in the final data set?
Brian M: So, kind of the example case is that as we're going through and trying to make our… core data sets more useful for combining any tails and using for final data sets, we go through and say, okay, this abbreviation is not very intuitive. We're going to change the name to make this more readable. That's going to flow through anything that has already been built off of the core data set. And any card that uses the old abbreviated… name needs to be updated to use our new more readable name. But if there have been several things built off of it, a couple of views, an ETL three cards, whatever, then there's not something that I could find that I could pull up and say, okay, it broke these two etls and this card, but the other card wasn't actually using that field. So that one's fine. I'd have to go into lineage and go, okay, here are, the data sets that core data set flows into. And then I have to go to each of the, one of those, look at any cards built off of them, pull up that list of the cards and see if any of them indicate that there is an issue that needs fixed.
Brian F: Yeah. So one thing… so I'll just tell you some of the things I was thinking, I don't know if it would include encompass all the use cases. But the first thing you can do, so if you're on your data sets, sorry, your data flows, you go to a filter and say… there it is needs attention. Sorry, it's over here, right? So anything that's failed will show up here.
Brian M: Well, before they run, or is that only after the data or the ETL refreshes?
Brian F: After the data set. Yeah. After it tries to run.
Brian M: Okay, right.
Brian F: Because it is a status, it will put it in a failed status. I.
Brian M: see. Okay. So there's not anything, to be able to preempt that. If I'm not sure which… thing has been impacted?
Brian F: Yeah. Other than going through the lineage is, if you're trying to look ahead, say, okay, I'm making this change and I want to look down the road to see what this is going to impact. Is that what you're saying?
Brian M: Basically, yeah.
Brian F: Yeah, I mean, without going through, the lineage, I can't think of anything, Nick. I don't know if you have any ideas there, no.
Nik K: It would have to be through the lineage or you wait for the ETL to run before we detect an error.
Brian M: Okay.
Ashli M: And it's really a near term problem more significantly as we are trying to, you know, align and, the architecture while things are still in production. So we're breaking production things as we're making",Consumption Pricing Model,122200.0,Corporate,BEACONCU.ORG,2,Financial Services,193,$25M to <$50M,Renewal,Blank,2: Determine Needs,Kate Kranz,2026-04-30,2023-04-25,2023-04-25,,,,,,0015w00002hvarUAAQ

Michael N: Good. This is his primary interest. He reports directly to the CEO. So be positive. Have we documented well on this, David? Huh, are we documented well on this?

Michael N: Yeah. So we can, I know in the document that he sent out, there was kind of some charts in there and where… we're going, but if we were to turn this over, say final project once we're done turn over to ipg, they'd have documentation on how to manage it and use it.

Michael N: 250,000 a year. Yeah, a lot of that is in the, is in the tokens though, right? The AI tokens?
David B: Yeah, that could move a lot depending on the token pricing and all.
Michael N: So, if they were to use their own tokens at a discounted price.
David B: Even if we use ours at a discounted price, like what I would say is, you know, that there's more to know there because we, you know, we've only seen a few files, we have no idea what the average file size is or anything else. So, I think it's I think we would say, look, we don't think it would be anything more than that 250, probably a little less, but to know the exact number, we would find that out during the next phase when we would actually, you know, start operating on a lot more of their images.

But yeah, it's just, you know, it's like we're in the sort of dash to the end of the year already, which is crazy between launches.

Kyle R: Yeah, exactly.

Thanks so much for jumping on as, you know, Dan, David have been hard at work at the POC… they've been, you know, experimenting coming up with thoughts and ideas and I think we got a good spot here that they want to show you something. So I'm going to turn it over to them and they could walk you through kind of where they've been and where we are today.
Kyle R: Sounds great.
David B: Hey, Dan, you want to drive it?
Dan G: Yeah, yeah, I can drive. We basically just created a summary doc. We don't have to go through the bowels of it but basically, it's just kind of what we're tasked with, you know, to be able to make those comparisons across the two files, you know, some of the requirements being the different file types we'd have to compare against each other and kind of the goals of what we want to be able to pull out and identify to help with your team. The approach was interesting. This is probably one of the more challenging problems we've encountered which was both fun and frustrating. But yeah, initially, what we wanted to do was use Domo to create just purely an agentic solution that would go ahead and allow us to process these files and whatnot long story short, just some technical limitations we came into with file sizes and things of that nature. In which case, I think Dave was the one that really just took a more simplistic approach to just break it down to what we needed to kind of tackle this with, which is if we were to throw this at AI and just simply ask AI to do something, what is it really doing behind the scenes? And so ultimately what we did is… basically threw it at it and found out that there's a lot of pre processing that AI would do on its own just in general. So that's essentially what we ended up building is just it's a combination of pre processing the data as well as using AI to do some of the comparisons and generation of all the texts that we're able to ",Consumption Pricing Model,549500.3,Enterprise,IPGHEALTH.COM,4,Media,24,$5M to <$10M,Upsell,Blank,Closed Won,Michael Napoli,2025-08-22,2025-08-20,2025-08-26,2025-08-26,2025-08-26,2025-08-26,2025-08-26,,0015w00002a1T9QAAU

They explored various solutions, such as using an Excel form connected to Domo and a Mega table, but ultimately determined that creating a separate row for each split detail was the best approach, while also considering the possibility of using different UI components to display the data.","Brian F: hello? Hey, Brian. Hey, sorry, I was, oh, you're good. I wasn't rushing because I was like, surely Mamta is going to be here?
Raymond A: Everyone's thinking the same.
Brian F: I know. Well, I was just in a meeting with her and I thought she said she had some, she had a couple things, so, I thought she was going to be in here right away, but, okay, maybe she's on the way into the office or something. I don't know.
Raymond A: That's all right. We can wait for her.
Brian F: Okay. There she is.
Shelly V: Good morning. Sorry for my tardiness.
Raymond A: Hello? Good morning.
Brian F: Mamta. You're on mute if you're talking.
Mamta B: I'm not talking. Hello. I came in like a minute back. Are you waiting for me?
Brian F: Yeah.
Mamta B: Okay. Sorry.
Raymond A: Okay. Go ahead.
Brian F: Well, no, I was just going to say, where are we today?
Raymond A: Well, I had a few things but I don't need to go first. You said Mamta might have something?
Mamta B: I did send an update to you saying that, hey, I created that beast mode. Did you see the card?
Raymond A: Oh, yeah. I did see the card. Okay. Sorry for not replying. Yeah, I saw it. I haven't been able to do anything with it just yet… but, yeah, I think that's what we're looking for, okay?
Mamta B: Yeah, if you want to test and let me know if it's working as expected then.
Raymond A: So, let's see. I have. Okay. So, back on the form topic, two… questions, do you have first, like a firm understanding of the cost… when using the form, the credit usage?
Mamta B: Oh, I'm sorry, I completely tipped on that question of yours. Sorry, let me just right away. Ask somebody.
Raymond A: Okay. Yeah, we can, if you send that out. If we can get a response in the meeting, that's fine, but we can move on until they respond.
Mamta B: Brian, so… you're using the app studio forms, right? Right? And you're not, we're not triggering any workflow from my understanding. It's just.
Raymond A: No, but it would be if I understand it correctly, the form when… you, right… where you can search a shipment number from the data set. And then we're adding a comment and I think that comment is going to a different data set that the source is basically joining on. So that's I know that would be basically another credit because it's but that would be a monthly one credit. That wouldn't be that scenario since it's just a data set you're only getting. We're only getting charged for the month. And actually it might be even free because it's going to be under a 1,000,000 records. So I'm not concerned with the data set necessarily, but every time it updates, I'm afraid is where we're getting where we're getting charged. So if I added three records, right? Or I should say three comments to three existing records, then we would get charged once. But if somebody comes back later and adds two, that's another charge, right? And that is kind of frightening.
Mamta B: Yeah. Let me just.
Raymond A: So if that's how it works, I don't think we could go that route. So, the other option that I was thinking of was having an excel form that would be updated… into Domo, so we could create a connection to a shared excel spreadsheet where these operations would work out of. And then we could just periodically update the excel connection to Domo. And that –, I guess that one refresh would be considered –… a cost of one credit, but we would – obviously we wouldn't do that until operations was finished, right? So they get in first thing in the morning, they do their work in their spreadsheet. And then when they're finished, they can just upload it or hit an execute button that would upload that new data to that data set. And then –,
Mamta B: yeah, I can check on that and get back to you so we can then decide the route you want to take after that.
Raymond A: Now, if we go the excel route though, can that excel file be –? Or… let me ask you this way, can Domo connect to that excel file from sharepoint, or does it have to be on a PC or a –?
Mamta B: No, it can connect to a sharepoint. We have sharepoint connectors. Awesome.
Raymond A: Okay.
Mamta B: Yeah. We just need to involve your network team because you'll need to create an app in… the azure portal. Like that's just a Microsoft requirement to connect. So it's not a simple username and password.
Raymond A: Okay. And then I have –… I have a quick question on this. Let me see. I'm going to share. All right. So in… the end to end data, this is the raw data. I created a new field called split path and these are all of our split details. Okay? Now, in Domo, what I have is –, so if we –, let's just take a random one here… these concatenated details, I was able to get them unconcatenated here because the way I set it up was basically every double pipe is going to indicate a new level of split details, right? And so I have that… I have that showing on every row, basically created a beast mode that would replace a double pipe with an HTML break, right? So, that would give me the split detail. Something – here's three rows of data, right? So every time it hits a double pipe, it basically puts it on a new row so that you don't have this – ugly cluster of string data, right? The problem I ran into on this is I can only get three rows for the visual display. Now, it's not a huge problem because.
Mamta B: –, hey, sorry. Yeah, go ahead. Hey, sorry. I don't know. I lost connection. Maybe, can you just repeat like for the last 10 seconds? Oh, sure. Yeah.
Raymond A: So basically, the way I structured the string is I have a double pipe separating each new… level of split details, right? So we have a single pipe here, just separating the od path, the pieces master, right? And it hits a double pipe and that's indicating a new row, right? So in Domo, I created a beast mode that replaces the double pipe with an HTML break. So, that will give me. So I don't have this long string of details. I can actually have it broken out in rows and still have it in one row in the data set, right? I don't know if I explained that very well, but it's not okay.
Mamta B: Makes sense. Yeah. Now.

How's it going?
Shivam M: Hi, fui, hi, I'm good. How about you?
Fui K: Doing well, doing well. You're good?
Shivam M: Yes, like I, thank you in the mail, but I really want to thank you in person. That Domo team. They always support me a lot. I want to thank Nick Nate whenever I, you know, I'm stuck, you guys are always there to help us absolutely.
Fui K: That's great to hear. We appreciate the feedback and it's one of those, you know, situations where redstone, you know, you guys didn't qualify for the adoption engine program. And so it's great to hear from the resource standpoint. Nick's incredible. He's one of our best resources and so, to have him aligned to redstone is just game changer. I wanted to just keep, I know that we've been having syncs with the team there, but I just, I wanted to keep this sync on the calendar in case there were any other questions or things that you or Shannon had from a support standpoint? Okay?
Shivam M: The last time we met till that time, we were having a lot of issues like none of the connectors were working. I had like two open tickets and we were not getting any, you know, any response, any constructive response from them. You know, they were escalating the issue. But the day Nick came, I discussed the issue with him and just 10 minutes after the call, he provided with the, you know, the resolution and it is working absolutely perfect.
Fui K: That's great to hear again what's the saying, it takes one to know one, right? So oftentimes we'll hear some of these questions or concerns and then we don't ever hear back, right? So, I know that it's mutual and we appreciate the collective effort you know, on your side as well. So, I'll let the team know from a feedback standpoint. I know that Juliana is scheduling some follow ups, right? In terms of working sessions or other priorities or needs. Outside of that, I know that Shannon is going to be going on maternity leave soon, right?
Shivam M: Yes, yes. I think that from October, she is not available. I believe… yeah, till September end, she is there, but I believe that since October she'll be on leave for three months, I presume.
Fui K: Perfect. Okay. Sounds good. Yeah, it's one of those sensitive topics I didn't want to ask especially because today, you never know, right? It's like no things are going smooth. And then something may happen. So I'm happy to hear that fingers crossed, right? So that's great.
Shivam M: Because of you guys, I get to know.
Fui K: Absolutely… well, sounds good. Let us know if there is anything else I'll work with Juliana from project management and the adoption team to help as needed or where appropriate as well. But I think from a directional standpoint, I think we're finally on the right track especially given all the changes from last year. So, Colin, he's, still, he'll still text me, you know, if I'm like, hey, are we still meeting or so thankfully, we have a good relationship. I need to stop by their office sometime, but I think the goal is like, hey, let's you know, we're showing our, you know, putting our best foot forward, right? So that we can keep this a long term standing relationship instead of was it Brian, right? The previous Guy who was, you know, overseeing the project. And then when he left, it was kind of like wait what's going on? So I think we're in a good position there, but yeah, let us know if you have any questions or needs, you've been phenomenal as well. Thank.
Shivam M: you so much like issues. I believe what happened when Brian left, it was like I was not from this, you know, prop tech background. So, initially, you know, I myself struggled a bit, you know, learning the key items, and then there were some issues like we were, you know, going from here to there like from username and password authentication, we were moving to API and, you know, I was trying to learn the, all the etls and how they have designed. So initially, yes, we had as redstone, we were on the back foot but with your help now, I think that we are on the driver's seat.
Fui K: Awesome. That's great to hear. So, yeah, let us know. I think so we'll keep the monthly sync on the calendar again. I know that we're working closer with the adoption team, but, you know, we can use this from a standing from a recurring standing point. If there are any other additional things from the account management side that we can help. But for today's, intent, we wanted to keep it a little bit more informal and just a, you know, broad follow up. So, but I'll let our team know again the feedback. We absolutely appreciate the opportunity to partner with you and work with you and so hopefully we can secure a, you know, longer term opportunity given the use cases and that you guys have more capacity for future growth, right? Perfect. Well, thank you again. And I'll talk to you soon.

Eric S: Good. How you doing?
Graham N: Good man.
Eric S: Good to hear it. You have a good trip. You're good vacation?
Graham N: Oh, yeah, it was awesome.
Eric S: That's awesome man.
Graham N: Yeah, it was great. Good time away, but definitely exhausting one of those trips that's like you're just going the whole time, but it was a lot of fun.
Eric S: Good. Yeah, I know. I think I was talking to Scott about it. We brought, I've got three boys, right? My oldest is 10. My youngest at the time was just under six and this was a couple years ago. We went out to Kauai and my wife's all like bring the whole family. You know, we want all the boys to come. I'm like that's such a long flight and long trip for kids that age. And even though it was a vacation, I felt like I worked harder there than I would anywhere else bringing my kids on vacation, but they had a blast and it makes it all worth it, right? But at the time, I was like, holy cow. This isn't it.
Graham N: For sure for sure. Yeah, we took the kids and hiked the first fourteener I ever hiked and they did it and it was very challenging to have them with us, but they did awesome. And so it was a good family moment for sure. What fourteener was that quandary peak? Yeah, it's just south of breckenridge.
Eric S: Interesting.
Graham N: So, it was a lot of fun.
Eric S: That's awesome. Yeah. Well, I know I'm still catching up. I was out in Montana, elk hunting last week, still getting caught up with all that stuff, but wanted to just connect again, see if there's anything we can support with. I know, you know, one of the things that you had asked that I did go back to is, hey, our go to market strategy and our pricing, like when we're starting to determine what that looks like for customers. I had a conversation with our CRO actually, and he was traveling this week, but I'm trying to get him if you want some of your go to market teams to jump in and just ask some questions about how we think about that. I'm happy to connect you. I don't know where you're at this point, but he was willing to meet and talk through it.
Graham N: Okay. Yeah, that would be awesome. I've got two guys here that would be great to get on with you guys to discuss that. We're obviously really conscious of renewal and the timing of that. We got a renewal invoice. And… so, I know we still have obviously some stuff to discuss with that, but I don't know when the best time is to start having those conversations because we're really focused on how we obviously maximize our credit usage with Domo but also how we use make sure we've got the right tools in place for the job that we're trying to do and what that's looking like. More and more is potentially ingesting and housing our data outside of Domo and then bringing it into Domo for all of the analytics and dashboarding and the clearsquare portal. There's no way that we can, I mean Domo provides so much value from that aspect. But what I'm noticing is needing to have more control over the ingest of data and getting it into a place that may work better. It's just we save on cost for sure, doing that and we just have more control over our data as it's moving from its source to a destination that I think would work out better for real time dashboards.
Eric S: Yeah. And you know, you've probably heard this, Scott's… fortunately the leader when it comes to this, we obviously have a lot of partnerships in the CDW space. So I'm curious, have you decided on anything or is it kind of just kind of the evaluation process right now? And you're trying to kind of work through what that looks like?
Graham N: Yeah. It's we're still evaluating for sure. We're working through putting… kind of splitting it up. Obviously, we need an object store for the… actual equipment messages to be able to run because we've got sensors that process a lot of that, send data packets with lots of data… especially vibration. When we get into vibration sensors, there's just an insane amount of data with some of those raw message packets. And then the process data that we're going to use for our real time dashboards and the live analytics. We're looking at timescale which is a time series database specifically designed for that kind of stuff. And then as far as the object store, I mean, we kind of probably as a lot of people do just defaults to Amazon S3… but we're not, we're definitely not set on anything. We're just trying to find that, make sure we're make sure we've got the right tools in place for what we're trying to do.
Eric S: Yeah. Those two diff, I'm just trying to think about, you know, that date and time component. What is the, I guess, can you help me understand a little bit about what that will allow you to do? I'm, just thinking like multiple tools, right? What is that solving? Is it more just the collection and the identification of date time processes… or like what is that adding value?
Graham N: Specifically to you? The time series database?
Eric S: Time scale? Yeah.
Graham N: Yeah. So time series databases are specifically designed to handle… data sets that have that specific time component with it. And with specifically with time scale, you can create very narrow tables in a specific envelope. And so it doesn't matter whether we're pushing vibration sensors to it or boiler controllers, we can keep that we have control over that narrow table and it allows you to do crazy amounts of compression with it because of how it's set up and built. And then it allows you to do averaging all… it's all kind of managed within, that database. And so time scale is actually a it's built on postgres… and optimized for specifically for time series data that comes from, you know, IoT applications… Scott.
Eric S: Have you heard of that one?
Scott P: No, that's my first time hearing about time scale. And I'm, actually like pulled up their website and I was looking at it and like it looks like they're growing by tiger data now. Yeah, that's kind of cool. Yeah. So, it's the drive to like upload time scale.

How are you? Hey, how's it going? Good. Hey, guys, what's up, Ben?
Benjamin P: How's everyone doing today? Not too bad. Good. Yeah. So, just to start off,
Phone C: were… you able, you were able to get that data set through the email connector pulled in and that's working for you properly now? Yep, that works which is great, wonderful. Awesome. Cool. So, you know, I know you've on the email that you sent over a while back. There were some other potential items that we could tackle and I was hoping that we could sort of prioritize those and figure out which one we wanted to go ahead and move forward with or which one we could help with so that we could be busy on our side working, you know, alongside you to try to move on some of these things. So app… studio was one of the things that we had discussed previously. Is that something that you guys still are wanting to explore? Have you had any time to explore it yet? What have the conversations been there? Yeah. So I'll go in reverse order. So we haven't explored it yet. It may be beneficial like one of the other, you know, challenges we're running to is just, you know, our data team resources here are like part time which I know you all have heard before, but we actually, we did more work in the first half of the year than we thought. So anyways, we effectively ran out of like budget hours in October. And so we're still going to move forward with stuff but it's more of a maintenance mode till, you know, basically for the next quarter, which kind of sucks. So, you know, I don't think realistically we'll end up exploring that like one of the things and I can't remember if it was on that list or not. But we had definitely talked about it at one point was like we had wanted to start building out that semantic like the AI dictionary… and we'd built it up for some. And then we had talked about, I think you had mentioned that there's a way to potentially like script something such that like, you know, if startup id is in one data set, we don't have to go, you know, it's in all of our data sets, we don't have to go manually append that or, you know, add that for all those data sets to me. That one is like just from a, if we were to sort of rank order things like that to me would bubble to the top at this point just given what we're going to end up realistically doing the rest of the year. Okay. So what I can do then is I can put together we… sort of need, we're… going to need a data set that… stores the master context or definitions for the different columns that you may find… in. The data sets that you have inside of the instance. And so we can do that using a web form. If you've got a Google feed or something like that you guys use that you would like to record those and pull those. In. What we can do is have a data set that every row in that data set will represent a column, and the second column in that data set. So the first column would be, column. The first column in that data set would be column names, and the second column would be, context about the column, and what we could then do is, you know, it, with the, if… we, recognize that there will be instances where we have a data set, or two data sets. Let's just say more than one data set that has the same columns, but the column names are different. So, let's say we have, let's say we have a table that has id and, that I let's say it's a locations table, and there's a column in that locations table called id, and we know, that id is the location id because it's the location table. However, you have another data set that has a column called locations id, and we know that is the same as the id column in the locations table, but they're named two different things, right? And so, if we acknowledge that can happen, then what we can do is using the master dictionary, we can then, create a form. Let's just say an app studio form that, allows you to, choose a column from the dictionary and map it to a column in one of your data sets. And then you just Qlik submit, and then it just runs a script that, you know, pops that context into that data set. So that's sort of the way I was thinking of that. You know, we certainly could have a script that runs every day and says, you know, but if you do that, you're the only way to fully automate that is if every single, column in every data set is named exactly the same. And I don't know that that's always going to be the case. And so, and, once you provide context to a column, you know, we can even have a mapping. Like once you use the form to map the context to a, a column, we could create like, a history that says, okay, you know, this column in this data set is always going to use this field from the dictionary. And then have a script that does run every, day that says, okay, every time you update the dictionary, update everything that's been mapped. You know, we can do that. Does that, does all that make sense? That, that's sort of me like brainstorming out loud? And so, yeah, I think like, I think that makes sense. I, my expectation was not that this would run… on an ongoing basis. Like I think we can add as part of our definition of done, like, as we add a new data set, like we'll define the data dictionary prospectively. So really, it's more of like a one time, you know, we have a lot of data sets in there that exist today. And so, it's really backfilling those. So I think that's fine. The, that data state you described is definitely true in our data, right? Where id is a PK in column one and it's a foreign key in column two and it's named something a little bit different. So that's definitely a, that's definitely a known data state. I'm just wondering like, does it make sense? Does it make sense? Well, I guess a similar but I guess potentially distinct case is like, I know for a fact like we've tried to be good about naming ids. So, like startup id is like a common identifier, right? And like, normally, it's camel case, it's startup id, all one word. I'm sure. In other, in some data sets, it's like startup underscore id.

Virginia C: How.
Brian F: are you doing today?
Virginia C: I'm really glad it's Friday.
Brian F: Isn't it crazy? It's a four day week… things?
Virginia C: Are harder because everybody's got to cram everything in.
Brian F: That is true.
Virginia C: What's new? How's it going?
Brian F: Trying to keep up with everything. I want to know what you're drinking. What did you make?
Virginia C: What is this? This is, wait, I have a Penny. This is a one nespresso pod with milk and pumpkin flavor syrup.
Brian F: Mayo, pumpkin spice latte, is that what that is?
Virginia C: Basically, the container of flavor was like 10 bucks at homegoods and we are going to buy coffee and milk. Why wouldn't I just.
Brian F: Just do that?
Virginia C: It's cheaper than I could buy a 20 ounce bottle of the flavor syrup for the price of one large.
Brian F: Yeah.
Virginia C: Serves them. So.
Brian F: Are you, do you have a nescafe, what are you, what are you using?
Virginia C: We have a nespresso machine and we have a breville espresso maker, but this is just like Pete's coffee.
Brian F: Nice.
Virginia C: Right. Didn't try to get fancy today. It's not one of those weeks.
Brian F: Yeah. My wife's been trying to make a, was it a cortada? We finally, she's like, well, I don't have anything to make espresso with. And so, I just got her one of those, the Italian… macapot? Yep. And she's been working with that this morning.
Virginia C: I love my macapot. I lived in Italy for a little bit, and that's the only coffee that the family I lived with had. Yeah, after three months, I was like, I just want a cup of American coffee… but the macapot makes what my husband calls diesel fuel coffee, yeah.
Brian F: It.
Virginia C: kicks you in the teeth.
Brian F: Yeah, I'm sure she'll be running up here any minute now just to run back down.
Virginia C: Well, send me an email. Let me know how it is.
Brian F: I will. All right. Sorry, sorry, Doug. Sorry, Dylan, I'm just chatting away over here.
Doug B: Nope. Loving it. It's great. How are you doing?
Virginia C: Good morning guys.
Doug B: Good morning. Any fun plans for the weekend?
Virginia C: No, not this weekend. It's been, I was telling Brian before y'all got on it's. Been a week. I'm… very glad this one's coming to a close.
Doug B: Well, just a few more hours here.
Virginia C: That's right. How about you guys? You got plans for the weekend?
Doug B: I'll be going to a couple of football games. My son's playing a football game in the afternoon and then a college football game tomorrow night. So, who's.
Virginia C: your team?
Doug B: BYU.
Virginia C: oh, very good.
Doug B: Yeah. So should be a good time.
Virginia C: Very nice. I am a gay sports person as long as everybody has fun, I don't care what the rules of the sport are.
Doug B: You know, that's how my mom is too. And I hate going to games with her because she's cheering for the other team and I'm like, oh, yeah, come on, mom. She's like, well, they made a good play. I'm like they're not our team.
Virginia C: Yeah, I owned zero like team gear before I met my husband and now I've got, you know, something with a logo for every season and what?
Doug B: A great wife, so supportive.
Virginia C: The most supportive… here's, what bothers me. People who've never been to that school are fans like, you don't know these children that are playing that game. Why are you so invested?
Brian F: You've never been there?
Dylan J: When you say it like that, it not only sounds weird. It sounds creepy. So now, I'll never root for a college team ever again.
Virginia C: Right. Like you didn't go to the school. So, there's no affiliation, like maybe your parents went, but still let's think about the fact that these are 18 to 22 year old children playing a sport that you are fanatical about, and you have no affiliation to any of those children or the school, okay?
Doug B: You know what? I actually agree with you and get it 100 percent. You know, what's funny is years ago. Like, I mean, I went to school at BYU, so I can claim it, right?
Virginia C: Yeah, no offense to anybody. This is just my opinion, oh.
Doug B: None taken. But I used to get like physically ill. If they lost a game, I would not feel great. It would ruin my weekend. It'd be terrible. And then it was just, I mean, it was a handful of years ago. I was like, why am I? Same concept? Why am I letting an 18 year old dictate how I feel and I have no impact or sway on the outcome at all. So, it's changed my fandom quite a bit.
Virginia C: Well, I'm proud of you. That's a very mature approach.
Doug B: It took me too long to get there, but I got there eventually.
Virginia C: I have no argument against the NFL. It's just grown men having fun. So, you know, do your thing, join your team? Have your thing, but the children part is weird to me.
Doug B: Well, I mean, I guess if 18 year olds are children, but I.
Virginia C: mean, I don't think that I was making all of the best decisions.
Dylan J: Oh, I feel an intense debate coming up now.
Brian F: No, I'm just going to say the older you get, the more an 18 year old becomes a child.
Doug B: That's true. That is true. Yeah.
Virginia C: Well, we're not here to talk about football. We are here to talk about Domo. Last, we saw our characters. I was coming away from a meeting where I… was unaware of the full picture basically of what's been going on with the budget for my team prior to my taking the role. So, at the time that I took the role, everything was steady eddy, you know, renew contracts, move forward with these things. But then I started getting weird signals around Domo but no concrete conversations coming out of my last conversation, I was informed that in March the budget for Domo was cut. So as it stands currently, there is no space for renewal. And in order to sign a new contract, there would need to be. There would need to be a huge business case made. And what we have working against us is not going to make it just a business case that needs to be made. Like what we have working against us is two years of nothing. So… as much as I hate it, I think I've got to make a plan around just not renewing.

AJ suggested involving Heather, the previous Domo builder, to resolve the data accuracy issues and schedule a meeting in mid-November to roadmap the data requirements for Asia's sales ops role and introduce her to the Domo team.","Asia P: Gosh. A month ago to yesterday. Okay?
AJ C: Congratulations.
Asia P: Yeah. I'm doing the VP of sales operations. So kind of just working with hopefully seeing the most value with Domo to be able to see what we're doing on both ends of external and internal with our sales teams. I haven't done too much because I am pretty new here. Still, I haven't done too much on jumping in to Domo. I know there was a couple pieces… of it that just wasn't accurate. And so I was, instead of wasting my time on something that's not showing any accuracy, I kind of just shied from being in there. So I am anxious to see kind of what you can show me on what I should be looking at with Domo and like what it can bring to me.
AJ C: Yeah. So, are you going to be the main person building in Domo or is that someone else?
Asia P: I mean, ultimately, yes, I think that I'm going to be, I'm the most inquisitive on what's going on with the numbers. So, we did kind of just an evaluation of our staff on saying like who's using Domo? Who's not using Domo? And not very many?
AJ C: Not very many people are using Domo. Would you like to have more people in Domo and building or at least dealing or?
Asia P: I don't know if I don't know.
AJ C: Okay, you.
Asia P: Know, I don't know what Domo can do, like, is it something else that we're just going to add numbers to? Or is it something that's going to give us things that we can get from the numbers. So I don't know what Domo can do or can't do yet?
AJ C: Okay. Oh, yeah. So, do you have you, you've logged in? Looks like I've lost you?
Asia P: Are you there?
AJ C: Yep. Sorry, lost you momentarily. So you've logged into Domo and you said some of the stuff you saw in there was inaccurate, can you expand on that a little more?
Asia P: Let me see. Let me get logged in. So I'm trying to even just get in there right now. I was looking more so at just like the overall sales that we had for inside and outside sales. And when I ran that against Salesforce, it just the numbers weren't matching. So it was kind of, I was like, well, I mean, I like the look of Domo. So I definitely want, you know, I would prefer to work out of Domo just because it's prettier. Yeah, to be honest, it's easier on the eyes. And when I'm looking at reports and trying to run things for, you know, by my third hour, like I definitely would rather be in there but I can't even get logged in right now. So. I'm not sure why that's not this single sign on. Okay? So I'm getting it. So, yes, the reports I was just looking at Salesforce versus Domo and Salesforce is supposed to be our end all be all like that is the most accurate access that I have to our numbers. And so when Domo wasn't matching it. And I know Heather's cleaning up a lot in Domo. But one of the things I think that she's working on and I've asked her to work on a couple things in here of just like the persistency to make sure that we are completely accurate on what number I'm getting there. Because the only thing worse than like me getting numbers is the numbers being wrong. So if I have, if I'm having to double check numbers that's just doubling my work and it kind of defeats the purpose of, I mean it might be pretty, but if it's not accurate, it's not gonna.
AJ C: Yeah, that makes sense. And I'm wondering if maybe there's a like… a delay on how often you guys are pulling data into Domo. Maybe because I assume Heather has set it up, it sounds like she was one of the main builders prior to you showing up.
Asia P: Well, she will be, I mean, she is, and she's staying on. She's gonna be the one building I'm gonna be the one using what she builds the most, I think.
AJ C: Okay. That makes sense. Yeah. And we've met with her quite a few times. Maybe I don't know if it's beneficial for you. Maybe on our next call, we include you with Heather and we can just kind of run through some of the issues that you're experiencing and we can bring some of our technical guys on there to see if we can make that. So the numbers are accurate.
Asia P: Perfect.
AJ C: Obviously, Domo is supposed to make your job easier, not harder. So, I don't want you to be checking in Salesforce, checking in Domo. Yeah, that's a little bit redundant. Okay. And then, so your title you are, you said you're sales of opera or VP of sales?
Asia P: Sales operations, yes?
AJ C: Sales operations. Got it. And are there, are you trying to share out this information with your colleagues also, or like, can you walk me through, how that works with Domo?
Asia P: So really it's just when I, any type of anytime I want to see something, I guess because we do because we like members, like what is our current members? What package are they currently buying? You know, what's where are we focused on? You know, it's December in December last year. What was our biggest selling product? You know, trying to see?
AJ C: Are you sharing this externally or is this all internal information?
Asia P: Internally? Okay. It'll be internal.
AJ C: Got it. Okay. I have some information like learn, have you ever been to Domo university or any of that stuff?
Asia P: I'm new to Domo in general. Okay?
AJ C: Yep. So I'll share out an email to you that just kind of has some where you can learn Domo, some free education courses. I'm a resource to you as well as Eric. He is the account executive. So we're able to answer any questions that you might have, or at least get someone who can answer them. Were you able to log into Domo?
Asia P: Yep. I'm in now.
AJ C: Awesome. Yeah, I can take a look at anything if you'd like if… you have any issues there.
Asia P: So, I mean, without like finding an issue and then showing you, I've been on back to back meetings. No.
AJ C: That's okay. That's totally okay. I.
Asia P: haven't even got from my desk in three hours. So I didn't get a chance to prep for this but I did, I mean, I just pulled up some of it yesterday. I was looking at the persistency over time and that's when I realized that one of the products that I need to know the persistency on was even calculating because it's short term.
