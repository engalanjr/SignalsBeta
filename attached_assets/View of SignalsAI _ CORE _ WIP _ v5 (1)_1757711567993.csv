The signals show they have 4 AP staff processing 100-200 invoices daily manually, creating a clear opportunity for automation.

Dale has been described as 'an amazing champion' who 'uses every piece of our platform' but is hitting limitations that require specialized technical support. The tone has shifted negatively with Dale expressing that it's 'getting really frustrating' and they're 'kind of guessing on our own' despite flagging issues 'early in the year.', Signals indicate Dale Whitchurch is the sole technical expert for Domo within IPG Health, creating a potential knowledge gap and single point of failure. Michael noted 'his skill set is so high that there's not really anyone else, in his orbit that has, the capabilities...to understand what Dale's trying to do and help him figure it out.' With the complex implementation involving App Studio, Workflows, and Code Engine across multiple instances, and with upcoming releases affecting nearly 1,000 users, this dependency creates significant risk., Multiple signals indicate IPG Health is undergoing an acquisition by Omnicom (announced in December), creating urgency to complete numerous Domo projects. Lizzie mentioned they're 'in the middle of an acquisition' which has impacted their FP&A system implementation plans. Michael stated there's 'a big push on the ipg side to get a lot of these projects through the door' due to the acquisition.

However, they've recently identified specific use cases around AP automation and finance processes that could deliver immediate value. The signals show they have 4 AP staff processing 100-200 invoices daily manually, creating a clear opportunity for automation. A Business Value Roadmap Session would help quantify the financial impact of these inefficiencies and demonstrate how Domo can address their specific pain points around manual data entry for payroll allocation, invoice processing, and bank data entry into their MIP system., Linh has explicitly stated plans to cancel the subscription next year due to perceived lack of value after two years. She was also unable to attend a recent important meeting about potential use cases. This combination indicates a critical relationship gap that needs immediate attention. A high-level visit would demonstrate Domo's commitment to their success, allow direct discussion of their concerns, and ensure alignment on the newly identified finance use cases. This is especially important given that Linh appears to be a key decision maker regarding the renewal., The customer has identified a clear, high-value use case around AP automation where four staff members are manually processing 100-200 invoices daily. They've specifically highlighted pharmaceutical vendors (Cardinal Health, McKesson, RX) as having the most repetitive invoices, with 90-95% coming as PDFs. This represents an ideal candidate for a rapid implementation that could show immediate value to a customer who is planning to cancel. A Use Case Sprint would quickly validate the solution and demonstrate Domo's value in addressing their specific pain point.",Chance Ewell,Jeff Ross,chance.ewell@domo.com,nick dewaal,Jordan Kohler,Andrew Rich,Pete Shelton,Chance Ewell,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Opportunity,https://app.gong.io/call?id=9220280809928626156,Domo | Stephen F.

The group agreed to prioritize automating the invoice processing workflow, with Domo proposing a solution that would use a large language model to extract and populate invoice data into the MIP accounting system, and include an approval process. The teams plan to schedule a follow-up meeting to discuss access to the MIP API and the required data fields to implement the proposed solution."
