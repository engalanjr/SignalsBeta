Andy emphasized this as 'really critical' and they're dealing with PII data that requires appropriate access controls. This is an urgent need as they're transitioning to a consumption model and implementing a new middle office system (Bullhorn) with go-live date of September 8th. Providing this feature access would address a significant security concern while demonstrating responsiveness to their needs., The customer is experiencing significant architecture issues including: 1) A massive spike in data volume from 3.7B to 16-18B rows (signal 578dd10b-9381-4ef6-837b-bf2f3a92a4fa), 2) Inefficient data processing with large datasets using full replace operations instead of more efficient methods (signal fcae622c-a981-4779-a168-b50cbfb50933), 3) Multiple signals indicating they have 'a lot of junk laying around' and unnecessary outputs (signals 05b25ac3-b9f2-47a1-9881-e5ca6a66263a, 0c0a966b-bbe2-4bdb-bac7-309cba99e04f). They're also actively working on sandbox implementation and preparing for a Bullhorn migration in September, making this an ideal time to optimize their architecture., Multiple signals indicate the customer is actively interested in AI capabilities: 1) They want to leverage image-to-text AI to extract resume data from PDFs (signal ebbd9f5f-4e56-4187-9095-ffda80e63d81), 2) They're implementing AI agents for meeting preparation and marketing one-pagers (signal 368e8ed1-9e41-4181-ab5f-98f52b0b1f0c), 3) They're concerned about data naming conventions and structure for AI readiness (signal 75489360-f209-42b1-8813-6b2d6005927d), 4) They want to use AI for data inquiries to reduce burden on analytics team (signal 2dccb311-a006-4a93-a7d0-c4a2e5146c5c). Andy specifically mentioned wanting to 'pause with AI readiness in mind' and 'set this thing up to the best of our knowledge correctly' for future AI implementation.",Neil McGoldrick,Madison Humble,neil.mcgoldrick@domo.com,nick dewaal,Brock Kennick,Keith White,Pete Shelton,Neil McGoldrick
